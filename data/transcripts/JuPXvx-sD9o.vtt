00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's now 1 o'clock I'm going to go ahead
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
and uh open uh today's hearing on uh
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
division 3 Finance
 
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
today's topic is this an informational
 
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
meeting um we're going to hear about
 
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare choices for
 
00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
Independence Nursing Facility financing
 
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
was scheduled for
 
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
today but we're going to slide that part
 
00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
of it the nursing facility financing to
 
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
another day there's a something referred
 
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
to often as a county cap and uh we're
 
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to discuss that separately on a
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
different day so this won't be a
 
00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
particularly long hearing I don't think
 
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
but I think it's going to be extremely
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
educational particularly for the new
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
members of division 3 Medicaid is vital
 
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
to the care we provide to our public and
 
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
um and understanding the nuances of it
 
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
um is important for us so um I have to
 
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
apologize for my lack of decorum
 
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
thought my jacket and tie were in the
 
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
back of my car when I drove off
 
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
fortunately I had a a coat so I'm going
 
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to go like this and hope
 
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
people aren't so offended they change
 
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
the channel but um so uh I'll let you
 
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
all begin where you want to
 
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
begin good afternoon my name is Ann

Landry and I'm ass so ass at
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the Department of Health
 
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
colleagues I'm Jonathan Ballard at work
 
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 align:start position:0%

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
officer and good afternoon I'm Henry
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
director thank you thank you for having
 
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 align:start position:0%
us here today I'm going to kick us off
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
as I promised last week during the
 
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner's overview of the
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
department that I would come back with
 
00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
Henry Litman to give you a deep dive
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
into the Medicaid Program um and the
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
differences between Medicaid and
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
Medicare so today we are going to talk
 
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
about again just the Medicaid benefit in
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
general um the different eligibility
 
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
categories the enrollment numbers for
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and really
 
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
dive into what our coverable services
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
are here as well as the finance
 
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms um and the different programs
 
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
with which we partner um and we have a
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
lot to say and also Jonathan will Dr
 
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
ball will help cover some of our program
 
00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 align:start position:0%
elements as
 
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
well if we turn to slide four just a
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
really high overview and again Henry and
 
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
Jonathan will um dive a little bit
 
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
deeper into this but Medicaid is a
 
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
longstanding public health benefit that
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
provides care to our state's most
 
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um residents whether that's
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
lwi income or pregnant women and
 
00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
children or people with disabilities are
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
different are different
 
00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
categories um what Henry always likes to
 
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
say and what we like to say is that if
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
you've seen one Medicaid Program you've
 
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
seen one Medicaid Program and that
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
really highlights because although it's
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
a Fally it's a federal program it's also
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
State driven so it's a partnership
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
between the federal um federal
 
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
government and the different states with
 
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
shared um shared funding and each state
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
is slightly different in both what we
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
cover and who is eligible so we'll dive
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
a a little bit deeper into
 
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
that as we turn to slide five this is a
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
really high level overview of what um of
 
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medicaid numbers so we
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
have the fourth smallest Medicaid
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
program in the country only one in seven
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents are covered by
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that's comparable that's
 
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
comparable to one in five at the
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
national level so we have a really small
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
program that covers about
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
184,000 um New Hampshire
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
residents as you turn to uh slide six
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
this elaborates um oh and I I'm sorry I
 
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
was remissed to say if you have
 
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
questions along the way we can either do
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
them at the end of each section or
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
throughout or whoever whoever serves you
 
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
best but feel free to let us know if you
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
have questions um slide six digs a
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper into what that
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
overview is as you can see compared to
 
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
um the Nationwide again we have one in
 
00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
seven New Hampshire citizens whereas the
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
the country as one in five um and really
 
00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 align:start position:0%
what the two primary drivers for this
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
difference are really the age and income
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
demographics in our state as far as
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
who's even eligible for Medicaid um to
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
begin with so our program is much
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
smaller and if you turn to page seven a
 
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more you'll see how we
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
compare to the National averages um so
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
we have about 65% of adults New
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on Medicaid are working that's
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
higher than the national compar
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
comparison of 61 or
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
61% we also only have 22% of our births
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid New Hampshire that's
 
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
compared to the 42% at the national
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
level so again much much smaller program
 
00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I think what's
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
most interesting to you on this slide is
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at um the uninsured
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
rate for the country for the United
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
States that's the dotted line at the top
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
we the dark black line underneath so we
 
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
have a much smaller insured rate in the
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire which again
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
contributes to our lower um Medicaid
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
numbers with that I'll turn it over to
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
Henry for a little
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
bit there's a
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
question yeah what do we attribute that
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
do we attribute that
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
to do we attribute
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
the yeah do we attribute the differences
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
to our demographics compared to the rest
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
of the states or what would you
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
attribute the the differences what we're
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
here so one major difference is New
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um per capita income is
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
higher than many states um in fact I
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
think we're in the top few um and then
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
when you look at demographics we're one
 
00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:47.879 align:start position:0%
of the older uh states in the country
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know I talk about meeting people for
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
dinner at four o'clock in Florida it's
 
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
actually New Hampshire has an average
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
age higher than um than
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's another question represent
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you very much and thank you
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
all for being here where would one find
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure as an extensive document
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
a list of conditions that are covered by
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid including
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
you so the standard will'll go through
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
this a slide forward about what is
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid and the criteria of
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
what is has what components must be met
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
to be a covered service but one of those
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
standards is medically necessary and so
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about what are
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
the required conditions and what's as
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory from the federal partners for
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
the states to cover and what is optional
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
services but for all medical conditions
 
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
they are covered if so all outpatient
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
and hospitalized medical conditions both
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
physical and psychological when they are
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
deemed medically necessary by current
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
standard of practice of published
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.870 align:start position:0%
 
required

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
we thank you what is the income limit
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
below income we have um later in the
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
deck a slide that shows you at different
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
family sizes if if you're okay waiting
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
to get to that but we will address that
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
that would be great and and then on on
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
slide seven where you show 65% of adults
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire on Medica are working
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
is that say that they're working but not
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
not making the threshold cor correct um
 
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
and you know the amount of work is not
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily defined here it could be 10
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
hours a week it could be 40 hours a week
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
um but you know if you're basically
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
earning more than $8 an hour um as an
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
individual for example you'd be over the
 
00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
threshold for a single person um on
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage as an example but
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
we'll get into that a little further if
 
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
you okay so I'm going to run by slide
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
eight other than saying Medicaid and
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
Medicare are not the
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
same um and jump to slide
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
nine so can I ask you a question here
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
sure okay I get it these are different
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
but do we also have to contend with
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
federal grants is that another major
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
source of of federal funding we actually
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
address that later on too but to give
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
you a quick preview we actually not so
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
much Grant funded in the Medicaid and
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare program um we're actually uh
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
it's a different type of funding than
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
that it's um I'm not sure I have the
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
technical name but it's not subject to
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
the federal health clinics the those are
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
those are Grant or direct funded by the
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
federal government and they're neither
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or Medicare some of the our
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
providers who serve us like federally
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers the fq hc's do
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
have federal grants that could be
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
subject to that review other provider
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
types as well but our funding from the
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
state standpoint is not conditioned on
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
grants for for the basic Medicaid
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
Program okay I'm I I'm just trying to
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that the new people to
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
division three understand that there's
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
Federal money coming from multiple
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
sources and Medicaid Medicare or not the
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
universe of federal funding you rais an
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
important point because when you look at
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
who else comes before you in terms of
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
all different types of providers that
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding may not be the majority
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
of their funding or if it is they still
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
rely on a significant amount of other
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
funding outside the Medicaid Program all
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
you um so the slide nine um really
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
breaks down into three sections the one
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
on the the left um there if if a state
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
chooses to participate in the Medicaid
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
Program which all states do and all the
 
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
Program which all states do and all the
territories

00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
territories
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
the in the first block you have to
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
provide the things on the left um
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
optional eligibility groups um and when
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
you use the word optional I'm not so
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
sure that's really the best term of art
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is um you know for
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
example low-income adult population the
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
second bullet is the Grant and Advantage
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
Program the third bullet speaks to Home
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
and Community Based Services we
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
obviously see as a state the benefit of
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
providing Home and Community Based
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
Services over institutional care but a
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
state doesn't have to have a home incub
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
based service program I don't know of a
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
state that doesn't because the
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
preference of the clients and the the
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
preference of uh um from a cost
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
standpoint then um some Medicaid
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
individuals have both Medicaid and
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare um and we call those people
 
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.430 align:start position:0%
Medicare um and we call those people
dual

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
dual
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
eligibles and so um typically um there
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
are two major ways that people who are
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare also get medic
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's because they have a a disability
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
like they're they're blind um would be
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
one as an example or they have some
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
major disability or that they're very
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
low income and they can't afford the the
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
cost sharing that goes along with
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare and so they they at a low
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
enough income that there's um assistance
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's available through the state and
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government to to support
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
them accessing their Medicare benefit
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
and then finally on the right um is the
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
regular Medicare program which um I
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
think probably most of you are familiar
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
with but generally it's when you're over
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
65 years of age um you become eligible
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
or you have a specific condition like
 
00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
endstage Ral disease or certain people
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
with extensive disabilities can also get
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
earlier a question represent Stringham
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh on the optional eligibility groups
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
are those ones that we offer in New
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we offer all of these and do
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
you get the same um uh
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
Financial um same type of matching that
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
you have for the mandatory um generally
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
50% so we do get additional um and we'll
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
cover that later we have a chart on that
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
um but uh just like for example granted
 
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
Advantage it's
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
90% um the level that we go up to
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
covering children for that that Delta
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
above the required we get uh
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
65% but we have a chart we'll cover
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
later so so before we leave this with
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
these four that we provide on
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
optional if they have a specific name
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
that we're used to hearing would you say
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
the name so that we can match
 
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
descriptions to titles sure um let me
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
start with the ones that come to the top
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
of my head first um the second bullet is
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
the granite Advantage Program um HCBS or
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
home and commity based service CFI is
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
under that uh uh program would probably
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
be the most common way that um choices
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
for Independence this is the third
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
bullet um wait wait wait third bullet is
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh would be choices for Independence
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
would be fall under that that's probably
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
one of the major ones there um and then
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
um the last bullet um breast and
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
cervical cancer you you'll see on the um
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
the report you get monthly on our the
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
dashboard there's a I know the print's
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
small but there's a line of the
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
different eligibility groups but breast
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
and cervical cancer is um that's another
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
one where we get a 90% match so we would
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
call out significant eligibility group
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah Family Planning um is a limited
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
benefit um which is that's what we call
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
it um and then up top
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I think here we're talking about
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
um um there's special in terms of the
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
the titles of them let me Circle back
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll email you the exact names I
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to butcher them but
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
basically here we're talking about um
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
covering um pregnant women um and uh
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
certain um the DD popul sure but it
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a program title that we can
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
hang they they do I just don't remember
 
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:10.519 align:start position:0%
them off the top of my head okay if you
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
could let us know later I'll definitely
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
you know I I just uh because we
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
don't we don't regularly dive into the
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
details but we get used to bouncing the
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
names of the programs around each other
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
yes we'll give you like a little cheat
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
sheet on that okay thank you and unless
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's on another slide um it isn't I
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
think in the form that would be best for
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
you to have it so we'll we'll we'll make
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
that resource available thank
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
you there are any other questions I'll
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'll jump to the next one go ahead um
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
the next slide on slide 10 I'm not going
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
to spend a lot of time on I think there
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
was a question uh Mr chairman when we
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
were you know planning for the meeting
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
here a bit that kind of what's the
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
history of the Medicaid Program began in
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
1965 but this chart sort of um
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
highlights the the key things that have
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
happened over time you know some of them
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
um the the major ones that have helped
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
people in our our state like for example
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
the the HCBS waiver the CFI program
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
waiver opportunity Katie Becket for
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
severely disabled children um and
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
obviously um you know around 2008 a
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
couple big things there um the Olstead
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
decision which dealt with you know
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
provide care in the least restrictive
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
environment um and obviously the of ACA
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2008 um and then obviously at
 
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
the end of this is the The Continuous
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
enrollment that was available during the
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
federal Public Health Emergency you know
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire completed its unwind a
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
while ago and uh um you know I think uh
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
before Congress and we'll get to this
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
later in the presentation though there's
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of activity potential in Medicaid
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
federally so I've seen this section uh
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
1115 waiver referred to many times in
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
our in our program so I I suspect you're
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to talk about that more but how
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
about how about the omstead decision do
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
we have any specific uh tie-ins to that
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
or probably uh when um you hear the
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
presentations on
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
ltss the division of long-term services
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
and support they're probably better to
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
speak to that than I am
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
moving to slides 11 and 12 I shared
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
slide 11 um most of it last week in the
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner's overview and I think
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
what's important to highlight again is
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the Medicaid Program really is a
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
Lifeline for the rest of the department
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
and even beyond for some of our sister
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
agencies um the medicate is not only the
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
funer but it's also plays the integral
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
role in collaborating on the
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
programmatic implementation of so much
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
um so many of our programs across the
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
department and um part of that ties into
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you go into the next slide in slide
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
12 into our road map which the
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner and and everyone who's been
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
up here has mentioned um in all of our
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
presentations really looking at how
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid integrates into whether it's
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools or the adult and
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
youth Community re-entry or the healthy
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
moms and Healthy Babies programs the
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
11:15 waivers that we'll dive into later
 
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.390 align:start position:0%
11:15 waivers that we'll dive into later
on

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
um it's really important that that part
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
of our agency is that with Henry's team
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
at the table with all the different
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
divisions that were able to collaborate
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
and really leverage the value of these
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh federal funds to better serve the
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire it's um the
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
way that we can look at what the
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
different funding sources are for the
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
different division programs and where
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
the money is coming from means that
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're able to to get the most um bang
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
for our buck if you will
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
so on slide 12 I I see Medicaid to
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
schools is is there going to be a
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
specific slide or two on on Medicaid to
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
schools or or is this the only reference
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
to it in the deck there'll be a a later
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
reference that I'll talk to about it um
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
but um if you want I can just briefly
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
cover something I don't want to throw
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
you off your Rhythm I I just I just
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to um have us Overlook the
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
importance of division 3 understanding
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
the medication to schools program sure
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
um I think later on would be better to
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
fit it in if that's okay very good
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
ahead so we're getting to part two now
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
the eligibility enrollment um so um on
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
page uh 14 slide 14 um we have I'm going
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
to walk you through just a a few areas
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
of Eligibility and uh how New Hampshire
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
kind of stacks up
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
um as you may recall in um the 2023
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
legislative session um the uh
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature approved uh expanding
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
postpartum care from 60 days to uh to to
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
12 months um and um also um did some
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility changes for for children
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
so far again because I don't know how
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
much more depth we're going to get into
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
as we're going let let me ask uh my
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
question about this here so I I was part
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
of the support for the extending this to
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
12 months postpartum and that God I
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was last year or two
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
years ago because everything blurs um
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
but um do we have any data to help us
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
understand about the utilization and the
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
incremental incremental cost associated
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
with the the utilization of the
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
additional benefit we do um that's part
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've been reporting to Health and Human
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
Service oversight you know the initial
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
things the you know the approval from
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation was in June we were able
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
to get a state plan Amendment effective
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
October of uh 23 we started covering
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
under this benefit you know it takes a
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
little while to you know get enough
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
experience I think we're getting close
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
there and we plan to as we come forward
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
to have more information about that
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
we'll have the number of people that
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
have have been able to take advantage of
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
that benefit and um over time we'll be
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
able to also look at um some of the key
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
um benefits of it you know uh just to
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
throw out a couple statistics here that
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
aren't on the slide deck that um in
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
terms of postpartum um deaths in in New
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that um while you saw earlier
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
only 22% of the births are from uh in
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh over 50% of the deaths that
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
occur are individuals who are covered by
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for for both mental health and
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
substit use disorder reasons um also
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
when you look at um cardiovascular
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
conditions I'm sorry are are you
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
conflating a couple of things it's it
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like you may be we're we're we're
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about the
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
postpartum care and you're talking about
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
50% suicide are you are you saying that
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
most of most so that 50% is due to poor
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
or inadequate postpartum care so the
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
availability of it to get all your
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
postpartum care needs done in 60 days
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
which has been historically what we've
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
provided if you try to just get a
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment today it's it's and
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
to get your your needs met so that's a
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
yes or a no I tried to ask a yes or no
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
question okay let me let me try again um
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the benefit yes is tied
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
to what I was saying maybe I need to
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
explain the statistics I was sharing
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
better yeah okay cuz this is a
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
relatively new benefit and we should be
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
during this budget cycle I I I think
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
there was good reason for us to support
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
it we just need to understand the actual
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
impact of the of the service
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards if I may just get
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
to what you said yes sir the answer to
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
your question is yes so from the deaths
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
this past uh year year that were within
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
12 months of the maternal morbidity of
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
the deaths of mothers who died within 12
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
months of delivering their their child
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
the majority of those deaths were as a
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
result of either substance use disorder
 
00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:43.950 align:start position:0%
result of either substance use disorder
or

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
suicide and those happened by in large
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
part after the 60 days of Medicaid
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
coverage was completed now with Medicaid
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
coverage exceeding for one year the hope
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
is this is where we'll be looking at the
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
data to come is that those individuals
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
will have access to life-saving
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
medications like medication assisted
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
treatment for opiate use disorder and
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
will not have a relapse and uh die from
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose so that yes so it sounds
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
like a great program are you maintaining
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
the distinction between suicide and sud
 
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
death so because I I I I don't want to
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
conflate those
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
if if they're
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
distinct they are distinct there are
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
many individuals who have we call
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorders those that have a
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
mental health illness as well as a
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder right um and we
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
have in this state a maternal morbidity
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
Review Committee that looks at each and
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
every single death right and does a very
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
deep dive into the causes of all those
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
deaths and informs us the Medicaid
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
Program and other areas of the state of
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
what can be done
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
differently uh to prevent such deaths in
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
the future okay I would imagine most of
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
suicide we can follow up with you on
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you did you have a
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
okay so new New Hampshire was not alone
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
in in adopting this um Idaho last month
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
was a state one of the later states to
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
make the 48th state that have adopted
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
this coverage um and so that that
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
coverage is this is at the same level
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
across the country in terms of the 138%
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
of the federal poverty limit when you um
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
come down just to the next section there
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant women um less than an equal to
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
200 1% of the federal poverty
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
limit with respect to covering women
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
under that section um we are the 34th
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
highest income limit um but with within
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
10% of the state median um so our our
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
our eligibility there is if you will a
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
little tighter than what you would see
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
as being the median in the country
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
whereas if you um look at children um we
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
have the fifth highest eligibility level
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the country at 323 per of the
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
poverty um and then the the final uh
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
group I put on here was the um the
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage population um 41
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
states are at 138% the District of
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
Columbia has some special um waiver in
 
00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:43.519 align:start position:0%
place to cover a little higher than that
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
but basically it's a standard program at
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
138% I I I have another question for you
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
on the U on the bottom page 14 in the
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
middle it talks about a granted
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
Advantage with less than 138%
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
of federal poverty level yes is that a
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
cliff or is that um is is there is there
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
sort of a declining rate at which I I
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how we would do a declining
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
rate but so I'm assuming a cliff but I I
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
I hoping you'd confirm that yeah if
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
you're if the only reason you know
 
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid's generally a categorical
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
program but if you're just lwi income
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
which granted advantages yeah it's a
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
cliff at
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
138 after 138 you're not eligible for
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unless you have a categorical
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
reason you may be able to um get
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
exchange coverage um that's an outside
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid that's the federal um
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
exchange but uh it is a cliff in terms
 
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.789 align:start position:0%
exchange but uh it is a cliff in terms
of

00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but we have some some
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
supplementary programs around it for
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
those that are like at 139 140% there
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
there are other Alternatives and options
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
still not if not if it's you're
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
qualifying just based on income H
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions anyone go ahead representative
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you for clarification the
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
the pregnant women that we talk about is
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
that irrespective of the marital status
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
yes marital status isn't one of the
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
criteria for eligibility um family size
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
though when we look at household income
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
is is a factor
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
so and and do you look just at the
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
income of of the woman or do you look at
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
the family income we look at the
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
household we go even there could be
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
living arrangements where it's not just
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
a marriage right so we look at both
 
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.110 align:start position:0%
a marriage right so we look at both
thank

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
you all right thank thank you uh are you
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
on slide 15 I am um and this I think uh
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
to representative Daniel's earlier
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
question uh the current federal poverty
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
limits uh that are going into effect for
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
2025 um and um had put them into
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
um and one only went up to a household
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
size of four you could keep on going um
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
beyond that but though just to be
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
illustrative here um and we have the
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Program the pregnant
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
women and then the upper limit for for
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh a child one of the important things I
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
want to point out and which we just
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
talked a moment ago is about households
 
00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
we when we do an eligibility at a
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
household level um let's say the
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
individual was just over the granted
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
Advantage limit the parent and say they
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're came in at 140 as an example of
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty limit um that parent
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
might not be eligible but the child
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're below the child limit so the
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
child could get coverage while the
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
parent couldn't in that instance so so M
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
just to make the obvious uh apparent
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
here um on this household size the kid
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't count because we're where this
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
household size is used to calculate
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
income and so we're only looking at
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
people of income producing age to be
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
part of the household yes you have to be
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
an adult to and what do you consider
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
adult well in
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple defin definitions
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
of adult in the in terms of the
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility side it's for the household
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
size for the household size size I think
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
um I just want to confirm it oh let me
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
give you an answer on that I believe
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
we're talking about over 21 um but I'll
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
let me confirm it because I don't do the
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
day-to-day eligibility sure these ages
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
are all over the place 18 21 24 26 yes
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
if I could speak to that for a moment if
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's okay so in terms of uh qualifying
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
as a child in New Hampshire we go up to
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
before you turn 19 right and then you
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
can pick up you could qualify for
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage except there are some
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that for example dental
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
coverage um a child is up to age 21
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
years of age if they've been in foster
 
00:31:57.679 --> 00:31:58.629 align:start position:0%
years of age if they've been in foster
care

00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
in um they get uh special coverage up to
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
age 26 through up to through their age
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
25 ends at 26 so it's oftentimes
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
particularly when we're dealing with
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
other agencies the definition of a child
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
and a an adult um you know most of us
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
would consider a 19y old or 20-y old to
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
be in the adult kind of phase but that
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily the case at each
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility class so if we wanted to
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
standardize that that's that's above the
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
state's level of authority right that's
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's Federal yes unless we were to get
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
some form of waiver which um I'm not
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
sure what the upside of that would be to
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
just to keep it simple yeah who whose
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
question representative tki thank you I
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure I understand
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
this chart if we could walk through a
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
scenario of say um a single woman who um
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
is at 200% of federal prop level um and
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
makes let's say just under that
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
31,44 I see correct right she's covered
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
yes then she has her baby and um Now we
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
move over to a she's now a two Family
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
household mm right yep and um now she
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
qualifies on up to $42,500 is that
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
correct but regardless the child no
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
matter what is covered because the the
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
infant would be covered in households up
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
to 60 8,000 yes am I understanding that
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
correctly okay I just wanted to walk
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
through how that all works very well
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
done okay thank
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
you and you and you know it was it was
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
the combined income between in your
 
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
scenario you said she was with a husband
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
no I didn't I said she was a single oh
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
at first I did say that at the beginning
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
I apologize okay it would I I thought I
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
said a single mother well the detail I
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
think you left out was um that if if if
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
the person is married it the household
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
in is the combined income of the of the
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
two correct okay yeah I thought in my
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
scenario I said a single mother though
 
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay thanks you did
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
both so slide uh 16 representa Stringham
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
I just love this math so I wanted to go
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
through so if it is a single mother at
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
30,000 um she has the baby it becomes a
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
two family or two-person household uh
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
for 12 months after delivery she'd be in
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
the expanded and she would be covered
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
but if her income was 30,000 going to
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
your 138%
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
FPL uh after 12 months she would drop
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
off but the child would still be covered
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
is that right after 12 months was the
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
condition you said yes okay thank
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
you and and this 323 per that puts us at
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
what the top four in the nation or
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
something like that fifth highest and in
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
the next two slides you'll get a little
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
bit of perspective on that too okay
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
represent Daniels no thank you I'd just
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
like to get clarification because
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's question uh what
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the household size the the
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
answer was that it is wage earners on
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative T's example you started
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
out with a single mom and when she had
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
the baby she said that now becomes a
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
household size of two and you said yes
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
but the the baby is not a wag earner so
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
i' like clarification in there as to so
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
that that both can be true um you can
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
have a household size in terms of who's
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
like um a child's income if you will
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
would not be counted against the the
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the mom in that instance
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
but I think the probably the the the
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
simplest way to to to get to this I
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
think in the example of if the woman was
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
single and you know the the 30,000
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
example right she would be eligible
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
because she's below the 2011
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
the child is added um in terms of
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
whether her eligibility would remain in
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
2011 after she did the 12 months of
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage she may drop to the
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
to the individual size of the granted
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program be able to potentially
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
pick up coverage there but if she's at
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
30 she wouldn't be eligible after 12
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
months then um the child would continue
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
to be eligible be because of the the
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
household size because the the parent
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
has to also provide for the child it's
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
not just a onep person
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
household so so the money that comes in
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
from being a medic Medicaid recipient is
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
is considered income no they their wages
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
from from employment um could it's it's
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
if you kind of look at your tax return
 
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
um it's the modified adjusted gross
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
income line of the tax return is what is
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
used for calculating the
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm really really slow a single
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
mom with a
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
kid is a household size of one unless
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
for some strange reason the kid is
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
making a bunch of
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
money no this is what I'm asking him
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
because I don't
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand I don't I I don't understand
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
why why are we counting a kid that's not
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
making income as part of the household
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
size because they have to provide for
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
the child um and then why do we mess
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the household size of one why don't
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
we start with
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
two there are instances I mean using
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
that some a single head of household
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
who's living alone who had a low income
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's a household of
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
one but the kid makes it too yes correct
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
but we started that she was okay I'm for
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
some reason I'm just baffled by that but
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead thank you can I maybe
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
I can my next question so to confirm if
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
I had two parents both working with two
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
children that would be a household size
 
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.990 align:start position:0%
children that would be a household size
of

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
four got it and though we know those two
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
children are not working their incomes
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
though are zero so their income is not
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
technically their income is adding to
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
that total but because they are minors
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
so the single my single mother story
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
with a child is a household of two yes
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
when the child's did that clarify
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
anything yes representative yeah
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nan I I think the
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
confusion is it's a pregnant woman while
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
she's pregnant it's one when she has the
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
baby it's two correct that that's where
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
the confusion comes I
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
think so in terms of taking up the the
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
when you come to your budget review I
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
think in terms of the the eligibility I
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
think that this this part won't really
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
factor in your sort of your alignment
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
item review only whether we had the
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
earners you ready can I okay so slides
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 um chairman Edwards was you
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
had when we were planning for the
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
meeting you would want it to see how
 
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility changed over time and um for
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
the Children's Group um the yellow
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
highlight on page 16 you can see that it
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
since in the last decade it hasn't
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
changed and you can see um how other
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
states are um in that regard you can see
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
how we're number five um if and then the
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
second page is on the pregnant women you
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
can see um here we spotted the the
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
median which is in the blue band about
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
half way a little more than halfway down
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
the page and you can see New Hampshire's
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
yellow hold on a second I'm just looking
 
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:21.109 align:start position:0%
yellow hold on a second I'm just looking
at

00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
it so there's clearly some discretion
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
here and the discretion is is different
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
state and we're doing very well with the
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
children and less well with the uh
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant women because we're 34th there
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
and fifth for the kids am I reading all
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
this data right yes okay all right Dr do
 
00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
you want to make just referencing our
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
earlier chart that did did show that New
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire though has a very low
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of pregnant women who were
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid compared to other
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
states even at the same time that we're
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
34th in the uh percentage of the federal
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
poverty limit so it's interesting that
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
we may have a lower percentage of the
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
federal poverty limit at the same time
 
00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:17.079 align:start position:0%
as still having a uh High insured rate
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative stream the 255 323 and so
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
on set by the legislature by bills or
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
are they is it based on a percent of uh
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
poverty or how is it done these are all
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
federal federal poverty limits that are
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
standardized nationally right but the
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
the percentages um the our our policy
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
there's a certain amount of policy
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
choices there for example for granted
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
Advantage there is no choice it's a
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
federally dictated one for children
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's flexibility um and for pregnant
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
women obviously thank you do you have
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
any history on how we came up with 3
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
23% yeah you know an interesting
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
question I went back um some some people
 
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
may remember back in the 90s and early
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
2000s there was a a a group called The
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um healthy kids
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
Corporation where we provided um
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
coverage and um going back to I think
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
1997 or 1998 we were at like
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
300% of poverty within that group and I
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
think that when New Hampshire uh healthy
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
kids Corporation went away was when
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
there was a an additional opportunity to
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
get a higher Federal match within the
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
state structure and um it was a
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it was serving the same
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
population and there was um and so I
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
think that's I could trace it back all
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
the way that far we've always I think
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has taken an interest in
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
kids I think when you look at um you
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
know the statistics compared to um other
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
states New Hampshire tends to be in the
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
top five or even the top three with
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
respect to Children's Health um and uh I
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
think part of that is because we provide
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
coverage sure it's just a weird number I
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they didn't pick 320
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
325 why why 323 was there some
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
underlying rationale that you probably
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just I actually have I
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
think there's an option you can go up to
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
318 and there what they call a 5%
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
disregard if if you're um looking at the
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
you know what the income is at a point
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
in time you um you have a little bit of
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
leeway there to to to consider it
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
because people's income fluctuate okay
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
represent torki very quick question
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't see it and if I it's
 
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
here I apologize I missed it the number
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
of grand estate children who participate
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
in the program um I think the next page
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
we've got apologies thank you great
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
segue thank you um so
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
um this gives you as of the beginning of
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
um January um if you look at the top the
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment um you the total enrollment
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
to the far right was just under
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
185,000 it typically runs a little
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
higher this time of year because people
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
who are um applying for exchange
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
coverage who end up not being eligible
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
they get referred to Medicaid we tend to
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
see but we've been running between 182
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
and about about this number um the
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
um the current enrollment and standard
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
is you know within 715 individuals um
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
compared to March of 2020 um the granted
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program is still running
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
higher than it was pre pandemic but you
 
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
know we hit almost 97,000 individuals um
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
at the peak of the pandemic and you
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
think about granted Advantage was an
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
income oriented eligibility a lot of
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
people um when the the job market seized
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
up for a while um were became
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
eligible um but um um you know along the
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
left hand side going under where the
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
words point in time are different um
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
categories the the children um we
 
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
covered you know close to 90,000
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
children um terms of the child group um
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
you can see that's sort of the the
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
bottom half of that chart there are the
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
different categories for
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
children um and then the various other
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
other groups here there are other ways
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
that this can be broken down but this is
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
the way we commonly uh track it in the
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
group I I think I understand this chart
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
all except for the far right column that
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
says a change from
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
328 right so that was the the time that
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
we began the from the time we began the
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
unwind how much the change has been in
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
enrollment if you go on to the bottom
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
328 24 or 23 23 um that uh we're you
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
know a little over
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
66,000 fewer than at the peak I had just
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
forgotten my
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
dates it's understandable all right um
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
the page
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
19 it's just a on the left hand side is
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
a map of which states have adopted the
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
41 States plus the District of Columbia
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
on the right um there is a little bit of
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh information about
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
um please on on the map there so there
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
are nine states that didn't do expanded
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid so do you have any idea of
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
what's going on for the eligibility
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
group that got missed as a result what
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
what what like what is Texas doing to to
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
handle the people people that we would
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
have qu qualified as eligible that they
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
and they don't even have the
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
program on you know uninsured is higher
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care Texas um in I think
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
2018 got a special waiver to help with
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care from the federal
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
government um but generally they these
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
states have higher uncompensated care
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
than the New Hampshire higher level of
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
un uninsured U Wisconsin has
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
had a hybrid program that they have not
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to change from but um they have
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
something that's close to it but doesn't
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
quite go up to
 
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
quite go up to
138%

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
138%
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
um and an Our number for expanded
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid is that the adult expansion the
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
yes and I expect that number to you know
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
as as the sort of plays through over the
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
course of the year to for that to come
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
down a little bit more right but one
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
thing that I would note that we noticed
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
as going through the
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic um period um Public Health
 
00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
Emergency period is that um some people
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
who are um have developed a
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
disability it takes a while to clear
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
either Social Security or other
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
Department's level of of of review
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
because we're a uh 209b state that won't
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'll save that for another day to talk
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
about but um the um that people who may
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
be in a bad way can and they're they're
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
not able to work anymore because of the
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
disability they can get granted
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage um and as they're working
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
their way through getting a more
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
permanent disability so we've seen I
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
think more of that um over time um in
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
terms of people understanding that that
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
path is available to them and if you
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
look at the right hand side and that
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
sort of um pinkish purplish uh chart
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
that um across the top are our percent
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
of federal poverty limit where people
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
are eligible in terms and there's two
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
really we have two groups of granted
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
Advantage um individuals there's the
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
regular group and then there are people
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
who are what we call medically frail um
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
often these are people who may have a
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
severe mental health condition
 
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
um but um you can see that there are uh
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
when you look at the total um enrollment
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
for the period we ran that there are
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
quite a few people that are actually
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
even below um um you know 100% of
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
poverty um and a good chunk that are
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
between zero and 50% of
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
poverty and I I'd also note that we've
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
kept track of some statistics in terms
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
of how many people over the last decade
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
have IND Unique Individuals have taken
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
advantage of that program it's over a
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million individuals in the
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
state um Unique Individuals that have
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
program I'm curious
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
um under Medicaid the granted Advantage
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
Program the federal government's paying
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
90% of that care I believe correct okay
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
and we have in our law a trigger that if
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
the feds opt to pay us
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
80% or less then that automatically
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
terminates our granted Advantage program
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
is that is that accurate it it's
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
actually if the trigger is just purely
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
at 90% that there's a notice requirement
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
immediately to the legislative
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
leadership and then there's a 180 day um
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
sort of wind down of it that that's
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
what's in the current law so anything
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
under 90% we our program starts to roll
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
up yes I think the legislature obviously
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
extend it that's why we have 180 days or
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
whatever yes and as well as you know
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
just to have a reasonable transition for
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
people if were to happen so so is there
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
a reasonable transition for people what
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
happens if that program goes away and we
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
have uh six months to to do something or
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
not well I I think um there are a few
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
different factors here at the individual
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
person's level right there if there's a
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
large part of the population if they're
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
only income eligible they they're not
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
going to have an option because if
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're below um a certain level of
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
poverty you you can't even get ACA
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
coverage they just would be out of luck
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
I think the other thing to keep in mind
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
and address this a little bit further on
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
um but I think I should speak to it now
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
at least a little bit that if you look
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
at how New Hampshire's overall health
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
insurance Market has has operated we've
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
we um have in combination with the
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
insurance Department's 1332 waiver and
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
having a an expansion group an expansion
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
group we see a lot more mental health
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
and and behavioral health conditions and
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
if the the that group were to go away I
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
think and this is where I say even if
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
you're not on Medicaid you benefit from
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage Program because I
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
think it's helping between the 1332
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
waiver and the granted Advantage group
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
it it pulls theis risk pools better for
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
the private Market to operate and the
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
ACA exchanges in terms of the cost of
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
the individuals the there's a higher
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
cost here than um than would be in the
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
ACA today and we've you know New
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's been either the lowest or
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
among the the two or three lowest on ACA
 
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
um Benchmark coverage and so I think
 
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.150 align:start position:0%
um Benchmark coverage and so I think
that

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's it's it won't be a good thing if
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's terminated for the for the state
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
for the individuals I think for our
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance markets and the costs for
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
others um and um but I also understand
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
that you know there there was a trigger
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
put in for a purpose and the policy
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
makers have have hopefully within that
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
180 day period have a chance to consider
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
do okay thank you the and made a
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
point um it would also be a an
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
incredible burden on our healthc care
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
system our local hospitals or critical
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
access hospitals our provider groups
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
with the increase of people likely in
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
the util uh Ed utilization and
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
uncompensated Care increase if this if
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
this eligibility group went away all
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
right so actually on slides 20 and 21
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of jumped ahead a little bit
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
making the point but just uh slide 20 is
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh from the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
Insurance annual report on the market
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
and I highlighted in yellow there the
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
the parts where Medicaid participates
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
but also in the footnotes one of the
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
things to to notice about New
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um is that in terms of
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
employer sponsored insurance we have
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
among the highest rates of employer
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
sponsored Insurance in the state which I
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
think is a good thing for um you know
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
the availability of insurance in in our
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
state um and
 
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
then um on page 21 uh you know sort of a
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
demonstrated a reduction in um The
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
Benchmark premiums for the individual
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
Marketplace coverage that we saw a
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
15.6% reduction um in the 20 to 21
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
period and that's sustained that we
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
operated lower than the United State
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
average and and New England average um
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
so I guess the point I'm trying to make
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
here is that there is I think some
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
correlation between having the risk
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
pools in the proper category based on
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
the way they utilize services and that
 
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
if Medicaid expansion were to go away
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
the grant Advantage Program there could
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
be effects on this for not people on
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
everybody so this is a really unexpected
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
result right nobody has complained about
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
their family health premium going down I
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
don't I never hear that I just always
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
hear that Health premiums are going up
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
and this seems to indicate that in fact
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
it's going down so this is the ACA uh
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
coverage and for ACA the
 
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
americ the afford act the Affordable
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
Care Act and this is The Benchmark
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
premium that they evaluate States on um
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
and um you know I think why while you
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
while we've we're certainly in a lot
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
better position than we've ever been the
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
cost sharing in these plans is still
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
pretty high and people people's out of
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
pocket costs all right so this isn't
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
showing the deductible and stuff this is
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
just showing the the premium cost yep
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
and so the premium standardize so the
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
total cost of the health insurance is
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe still going up but while the
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
premium looks like it's not right I mean
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's a Apples to Apples
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
comparison but it isn't the whole apple
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
right a lot of worms in the apple and
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
and you've mentioned 1332 a few time
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
when are you going to teach us what a
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
1332 is so um this is within the
 
00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
insurance Department's uh sphere but
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
I'll try to do U something with it uh
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
that hopefully will be helpful here um
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
so the way the insurance Market gets
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
priced um that each individual health
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
plan when they have high cost cases they
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
have to figure in their premium when
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
they set their premium that um that they
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
might get one of these high cost cases
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
the 1332 waiver is helps provide some
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
protection so that they can uh uh set a
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
lower premium because they not exposed
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
to all the risk and so more than that I
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
don't think I can do it justice is
 
00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
probably the insurance department but
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
effectively it's a risk sharing
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism with the federal government
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
and the state and and the and the
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
providers to um you know not have to
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
price as high for those extraordinary
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
cases right it's insurance for the
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
insurance yes okay and we just uh and
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance department recently got
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
this renewed um this year okay
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
representative end of last year uh just
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
back on on slide 18 um mgia and Ng M
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
what's the uh acronyms for that I think
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
I know but I rather hear it from you
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a a code in our system
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we probably should have printed that
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
out further but mgia is the regular
 
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
Granite Advantage um and MGM is people
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
who have identified that they're
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
medically frail um typically that um if
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
this was pertinent at a point in time
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
when um people could choose
 
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039 align:start position:0%
be outside of the Managed Care Program
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
um this goes back ways that um people
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
had particularly um difficult medical
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
conditions they could choose to be out
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
and we had the premium assistance
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
program for a short period of time in
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where we did private
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
mcos um separate followup if it's okay
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
the um just just a reminder as long as
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
long as you're consistent with your
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
questioning you can just keep going uh
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
you you also talked about uh you know
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
what happens if if where do these people
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
go we we had a lot of people drop off
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
Granite State Advantage uh at the end of
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic how did they do and um we
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
learned from that so A number of them
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
were able to get uh either employer
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
sponsored Insurance um there are some
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
statistics out there on that um I just
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
don't have them off the top of my head
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of the number of people covered
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
in the individual Market that's um that
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
went up um not not the whole Delta but I
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
think somewhere over
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
20,000 individuals from like the during
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
the pandemic period but we can do a
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
little research to provide you a better
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
answer there um but um you know
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
fortunately because those people that
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
had a drop that because New Hampshire
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
had the lowest exchange coverage in the
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
country or the second lowest during that
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
that time they had an option that was as
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
cost effective as you could find out
 
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
there um and then also employer
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
sponsored Insurance also became
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
well so I think flipping through this
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're done talking about the
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
184,000 plus that are covered by
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I think we can jump to the next
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
is there a well I I had a a question
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
still okay so the
 
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
184 uh Plus
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
is divided between three uh Managed Care
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
organizations in New Hampshire right
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
every Medicade person is serviced by
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
MCO with with a few small Exceptions
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
there are certain like American Indians
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
can um there's uh certain protected
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
groups and they're very small it's like
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
and then there are people who have
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
In-N-Out Medicaid you've heard that
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
issue if you're you're only getting
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Eligibility once you incur a
 
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
certain amount of medical expenses so
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
there about 2,000 people of um in the
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program that are um not in the
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
manage Care organizations because either
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
they're not consistently in so do we pay
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
for them separate as a fee for service
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
yes okay so the other 182 is in one of
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
the three mcos I think all
 
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
184,000 here are in the MC's
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
um but you just told me about 2,000 that
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
2,000 aren't I I think that we we're
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
capturing here this is the total
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid populations say 182,000 that
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
are probably in the mcos and and 2,000
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
outside of it okay and then generally
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
how do people find which MCO they're in
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
is that a a completely optional election
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
or is that an assignment what what is
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
that it it's both um you can choose um
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
you can on our website you can can find
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
out about what the offerings are of the
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
the mcos or if you don't make an
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
election we do um an automatic
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
assignment to one of them um and we're
 
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
um part of the reprocurement we had a
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
period of time where people um and we're
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
just about ending it where people who
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
were on assign would go to the MCO that
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
was not at a um a population level we
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
feel like 50,000 is where you need to be
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
in the state to to have a break even
 
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
break financially viable um MCO and so
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
um Amer Health which was the new entrant
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
we we had a period where we did this
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic they went well above
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
50,000 but then post pandemic
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
um they fell considerably below that to
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
like 30,000 something so we've the
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
unassigned members I think they're
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
they're just under 49,000 today so once
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
we hit the 50,000 threshold we'll go
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
every third person um goes to one or the
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
other but people do choose open
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment period all three of the mcos
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
cover the exact same eligibility yes
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
because that's in contract Thou shalt
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
provide the following
 
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility so so to the extent that
 
01:02:45.279 --> 01:02:46.190 align:start position:0%
eligibility so so to the extent that
there's

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
competition they're competing on the
 
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
basis of service quality and reputation
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
with interacting with the providers yes
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay just trying to understand that
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
market a little and the members and what
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
about the members well they would also
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
be competing upon among for their
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
service quality reputation to the
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
members right because the members can
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
self- select right which y right they
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
can change every year okay that's great
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
like I said this isn't educational I I
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of us actually
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
really understand how this Market Works
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
how it's paid for and and so thank you
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
again in for the
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
education go ahead okay so we're on
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
slide 23 now um getting into the what's
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
covered in um so there are mandatory
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
requirements to be covered under on the
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
left hand side of page 23 the mandatory
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
Services categories on the right hand
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
side are quote optional um and I
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
highlight we highlighted the ones in
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
yellow that are typically considered
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
part of the essential benefit package um
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
in the under the um Affordable Care Act
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
but you know I can tell you um back in
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
the I think probably the late 90s um
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
during a budget time New Hampshire
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
decided to um reduce the number of
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that could be filled um
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's actually a study in the New
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
England Journal of Medicine about what
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
the consequence of that was was that um
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
more people ended up being
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
institutionalized because they didn't
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
get their medications that they needed
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
so when you look think about like
 
01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy as the first one on the list
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
being optional you know when you look at
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
today and we'll have a slide later on
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
that prescription drugs are a very major
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
part of the program almost approaching a
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
third um so that you know to provide the
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
things on the left without providing the
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs would would not be
 
01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
such a good outcome some of the other
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
services like eyeglasses and hearing
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
aids you know reflect the the the
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
population um and uh um you know when
 
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
you go down this list is really not so
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
to understand the word optional this is
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
optional to the state yes not optional
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the Managed Care Organization correct
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
the all of these are now mandatory
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
because we have a state law that says
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
they they need to provide these so they
 
01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
were optional to us the legislature not
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
to the MCO correct
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh go ahead can you explain then
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
why um the dental is considered optional
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
I thought we had Medicaid dental
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
coverage so it was a a choice to provide
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
for kids it's not a choice but for
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
adults it was a choice to to provide
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
adult dental coverage um you have to
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
provide like Emergency Care like if
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
someone had an infection and you know
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
that was going to cause a systemic issue
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
we'd pull teeth and such right now we
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a real adult Dental benefit that
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
was an optional choice on the part of
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
the state um will since you asked the
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
question I sorry okay I miss reading the
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
chart then yeah the fact that it's not
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
highlighted means that it was our
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
optional choice to give it to add it to
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
the program right and all of these are
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
actually optional what I by highlighting
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
I was just showing the ones that are
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
considered mandatory in the um exchange
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
coverage space that okay I'm sorry I
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the list thanks um the
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
dental program you know from your budget
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint um is there was a settlement
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
that uh came in as a result of some um
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
work that the department had done with
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh one of the mcos
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
and through this bym coming up the the
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
cost of the adult Dental benefit will be
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
still be able to be picked up by that uh
 
01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:41.069 align:start position:0%
still be able to be picked up by that uh
that

01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
settlement so that was that centin money
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
was thought to last us through this
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and I think that's still
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
the forecast yes yeah U I had
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham first and then
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
I'll come back to you representative
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
Angel uh
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
Topic near and dear to a heart where do
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
ambulance services fit in under this
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
chart or do they they do um they're
 
01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:07.850 align:start position:0%
chart or do they they do um they're
they're

01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:09.430 align:start position:0%
they're
[Music]

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
um they're covered in our contract under
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
the the transportation um area but it's
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
I guess would fall under sort of
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
emergency um and patient oh patient
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
hospitalization would be where we'd
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
would would probably fit it in this I
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
guess their
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
you know it it could be detailed out
 
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
further but just try to capture the
 
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.349 align:start position:0%
further but just try to capture the
broad

01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
categories representative Daniels thank
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
you for someone who is dual eligible is
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Medicaid the primary um
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
typical typically it's Medicare that's
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
primary for someone who's over 6 65 and
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
older um there are times I think with
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
some of the the the waivers that it may
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
be reverse um
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
does that hold true for the under under
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
65 with the disabilities too I I think
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
that I need to it's not my area of full
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
expertise so but I believe that there
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
are certain instances where Medicaid
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
could be primary but dual eligibles when
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Medicare Medicaid
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
we're picking up the the deductibles um
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the co-payment
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
percentages okay so if I just understood
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
you to say that Medicaid you you
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
you Medicaid are picking up the
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
deductible so you're the primary so
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
we're secondary in that instance right
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
you represent solki you look okay I fell
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
for the head
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
fake um so we'll continue with slide go
 
01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
fake um so we'll continue with slide go
ahead

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay Medicaid to schools I just I think
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
this might be a point where I could jump
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
in and and talk about that for a moment
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
um so Medicaid to
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
schools um and are you on 24 you know
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
what I think actually I'm going to let
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
you're still on 23 I'm gonna have
 
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
Jonathan go now and then I'll I'll come
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
back to it I think when we get to the
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
next section okay we'll continue on then
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
with slide number 24 which is uh
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
explaining that category a little
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
further that's on page 23 of the early
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
periodic screening Diagnostic and
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
treatment for children it's commonly
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
referred to as
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
epsdt um that's an interesting acronym
 
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
what it really is though is that any
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
child that is covered by the Medicaid
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
Program it's mandatory for the state to
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
cover not only what's sort of normal
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
Medical Services or normal medications
 
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
that are on our state formulary but for
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
any can any treatment that helps a child
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh maintain function or could be
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
improving for them this is often times
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh some type of a piece of medical
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
equipment or durable medical good uh and
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
I point this out because this is a
 
01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.630 align:start position:0%
I point this out because this is a
catchall

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
catchall
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
category and if you ever have a
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
constituent uh of yours a child that's
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid and they're having
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
difficulties covering something this is
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
where we use our discretion so these
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
cases come to myself and to the Medicaid
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
medical directors uh on a Case by casee
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
basis we're small enough state that we
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
actually review every single one of
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
these situations to determine whether or
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
not something that is outside the norm
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
that would be of a medical benefit or
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
just to keep the child at their normal
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
level of functioning uh is a coverable
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
service so continue
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
on so moving into um so so was that
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't the schools the Medica going pick
 
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
that up in this section coming up here
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
all right thanks so so key financing
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
isues um on the left hand side of slide
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
26 um when we make a payment to a
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
provider I think as we've talked about
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's a a partnership between the state
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
and federal government um that we each
 
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
contribute towards effectively paying
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
the provider um and so that the amount
 
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
that each of the the the yellow circle
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
and the green circle um contribute in a
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
particular situation is um it changes
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
based on different factors which I'll
 
01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.030 align:start position:0%
based on different factors which I'll
get

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.149 align:start position:0%
get
into

01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
um the you'll sometimes hear the term
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
fmap as an acronym it's the federal f um
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
Federal Medical Assistance percentage
 
01:11:48.629 --> 01:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's the percentage that can be drawn
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
the actual uh payment is the federal
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
participation I don't know why they have
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
two different acronyms to basically
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
basically describe the same thing but
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
you might hear ffp or or fmap
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
essentially they're the the same thing
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
um but um in terms of
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
um fmap which we'll get into a little
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
bit uh it's varies by state um in terms
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
of the minimum fmap and we'll we'll look
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
at that in a moment um but then the last
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
bullet in the the square there um under
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
state federal share there's different
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
percentages for different activities
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid schools is kind of a somewhat
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
unique um in terms of the federal
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
match the way that um it has worked in
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that U Medicaid
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
reimburses schools for services that are
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
in the what I'll call the plan whether
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's an IEP plan or some other so so so
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
the way you said that sounds like a
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
direct relationship between the federal
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
government and the schools bypassing the
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
state no um because the they have to
 
01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
state no um because the they have to
build

01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
build
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um for the the services that
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
they they provided school does um but
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
instead of paying them if the say the
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
fee schedule amount for a service was
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
$100 we would pay them
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
$50 and the the federal government
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
considers what the school is
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
contributing towards the service is the
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
part they don't get paid um and so
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
um today the we federal government has
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
advised New Hampshire and other states
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
that um that the federal government
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
wants to pay half the cost and so that
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
our fee schedule actually is probably in
 
01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.629 align:start position:0%
our fee schedule actually is probably in
many

01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
instances um lower than their full cost
 
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
so they're really not getting half the
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
cost so by the end of uh State fiscal
 
01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.110 align:start position:0%
cost so by the end of uh State fiscal
year

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
26 we need to convert to um
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
a different methodology for claiming
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
funds which I want to you know from a
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
good standpoint um will provide the
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have schools be able to
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
claim for coverable services under
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools 50% of their real
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
costs um and so they'll be filing um
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'll call a cost report of some kind and
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
um we'll pay them on an interim basis
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
and then we'll up to what their actual
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
costs were and so we we got a Federal
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
grant to help us with the implementation
 
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
of that which we hope does not get um
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
involved in um not being we've got some
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
of the money already we're hoping it
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
continues to be paid but um we're in the
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
middle right now of doing a request for
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
proposal to um do a procurement to uh
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
support schools with a vendor to to uh
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
implement this new claiming methodology
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fairly common methodology uh
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
but in New
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we're sort of a bit late to
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
that that game and I think it's for
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh how we do funding versus
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
some other states um and um so schools
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
will um will provide the services as
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
they do today that fit within the
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to school space they'll they'll
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
still build like they do today but will
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
settle up against their actual costs um
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
at a time um after the the particular
 
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
year is completed could you provide us
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
with a list of the things that schools
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
can um provide services for so I think I
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
can brought a little clarity about the
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools know essentially
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
schools have requirements to provide uh
 
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
Educational Services to students that
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
fit within the individualized education
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
plan so you'll hear that term a lot
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
IEPs many of those are though medical
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
services that fit within treatments like
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh that fit within treatments that we
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
would cover in in a doctor's office or
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
another type of enrolled Medicaid
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
providers offices already so these are
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
services that the schools are required
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
to provide to the student already and
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
what Medicaid the schools does is that
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
is then just as you say for those types
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
of services is able to provide 50 % of
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
those costs to the school so it helps
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
alleviate the budget pressure at the
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
local level using these federal funds so
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
so most of the money that's going to the
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
schools for through this program most of
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
it like over 90% are related to Services
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
related to the IEP the students IEP
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
there there are a couple of of different
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
classified plans but IEP is a good
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
rubric to describe the the group of
 
01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.390 align:start position:0%
rubric to describe the the group of
things

01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
so so what percentage generally goes due
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
to IEP 2/3 no all all of it has to fit
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
within a plan there are different types
 
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
of plans which I'm not expert on within
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
the school environment um that and I can
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
give you a list of them I just don't
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
remember all the acronyms off the top of
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
my head and I don't want to acronym you
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
to death here but the IEP the individual
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
education plan it's for services that
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
are health related that support the
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
child to be able to get an education so
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have a problem with the IP
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to understand the
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
universe of services that schools are
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
able to build Medicaid for and I keep
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
hearing IEPs as though that was
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
everything and it's not let me let me um
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire today anything that's
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
setting um within our state plan is
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
available to a school so me they could
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
do mental health they could do
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation they could do pretty much
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
anything that would be appropriate for
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
helping a kid get the education that
 
01:17:59.070 --> 01:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
they need it could be because of a
 
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
physical disability it could be a
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
learning disab and the schools are set
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
up to provide mental health
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
counseling they they probably provide a
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
limited amount of that but but if they
 
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
needed a to Pro to to support the say
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
kid had a behavioral problem right that
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh because of an Autism
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
situation as an example and they needed
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
an aid to support that child in um you
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
know maintaining the ability to attend
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
the classroom that's a service that we
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
can pay for and before that service is
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
rendered the parents consent is obtained
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
they have to get a consent of the parent
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
for not only the plan but also to Bill
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and the child has to be
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
obviously be covered by Medicaid for Are
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
Family Planning Services included on the
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
list and are parental consent required
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
for them it's it's um I'm not a I'm not
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
aware that Family Planning would fall
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
within a plan in order to help a child
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
meet their education plan it would
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
Landry sorry I just I if I could just
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
jump in I just think it's really
 
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
important to distinguish this is not a
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
health care clinic within a school
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
system that children with Medicaid are
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
eligible eligible to receive services
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
this is strictly Medicaid covered
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
Services as as Dr bad highlighted that
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
are there to support the child's
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
education plan that's determined between
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
the parents the child if it's
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the child to be involved
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
that conversation and the School
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
administrator so you're you're coming
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
back to that 100% of the medic Cade
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
money is in support of an
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
IEP or equivalent plan it may not be
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
called an IEP in some plans but it it is
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's usually called an i p sometimes
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's a 504 um I'm not I'm not sure4 is
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
one of the 504 IP is so it's for those
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
services that are covered by Medicaid
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
for a Medicaid child but for the sake of
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
making them successful in school so this
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
isn't if a child who has Medicaid can't
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
just go get healthc Care at the at the
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
school I think it's really important to
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
distinguish it these are strictly
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
services covered in their education plan
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
determined by the parents this and the
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
the school counselor teacher whomever
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
those um appropriate school yeah
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
Administration and and that's what's
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
covered and and this the Medicaid
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
school's funding takes the burden off
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
the schools and this new program in fact
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
puts more money in the school's hands
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
which is really critical to help offset
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
these costs because as we know you know
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
Education costs are that's a burden as
 
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
well and there's a lot of costs that the
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
schools need to cover I think I think
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
most people who look at this U like the
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
idea that if there's a medically
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate Services helping with the
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
education plan that it's good to go
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and take advantage of the federal
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement what what what happens
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
though is
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a vacuum of knowledge
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
and information about it and people hear
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
it and jump to conclusions and they're
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
concern that we're setting up miniature
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
clinics in the in the schools and that
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
by doing that we're circumventing
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
parental knowledge of what's going on
 
01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
with their kids so I'm asking you these
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
questions in sort of a harsh way to make
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
sure I understand exactly the Precision
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the boundaries between what's in and
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
what's out so that I can help you know
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
I'll just admit it that most of it's
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
within my party that has cynicism about
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
this and so so I need to understand this
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
is all I thank you I'm chairman Edwards
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
I I I hear that question and that's why
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
I really want to be very clear that this
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
is not healthc care clinic in a school
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
system this is Medicaid covered services
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
for children who have an education plan
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
and this is required for them to be
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
successful in class but thankfully
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid covers these Services despite
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
that it's coming um in a in education
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
setting this is totally separate I think
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid of schools it's almost the two
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
this is giving Medicaid funding to the
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
school systems to cover the services are
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
required for a school for child to be
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
successful so so gender transitioning um
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
counseling is not part of what would
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
make up an
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
IEP no I mean I I believe to um Henry's
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
points autism Maybe
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I I think of my own I'm so
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm almost embarrassed to have to
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
ask these questions but these are the
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
questions that pop up in the wild that I
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
need to be able to deal with and I so I
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
I just appreciate it and I know there
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
are other questions by now
 
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels thank you I
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
haven't heard you mention it
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
specifically but uh does the the
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Support also include the outof
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
district placements
 
01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh that could cost hundreds of thousands
 
01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:57.629 align:start position:0%
uh that could cost hundreds of thousands
of

01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
dollars so in terms of some aspects are
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
not coverable by Medicaid like the
 
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
residential component of it but if they
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
have medical needs and Dr balad deals
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
with this more frequently than me so
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
I'll let him frequently involved in a
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
case-by case basis for children with
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
these specialized needs that are not
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
being able to receive the the Medical
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
Services usually is uh a component of it
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
that is not able to be met in the
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
setting at school and so those
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
situations then we frequently will meet
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
with um the family or area agencies that
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
are assisting families uh and school
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
districts and whenever those situations
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
arise it's a bit of figuring out what
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
component of those out of District
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
Services fit within the bucket of
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
medical services in for Medicaid
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid cannot pay for room and board
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh in out of District settings and
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
that's a a significant component uh so
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
allowable thank you I was just looking
 
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
to take a couple steps backwards and was
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
maybe going to try to um ask for some
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
specific examples for example I know
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
that a school I worked in had an OT room
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
for occupational therapy that's a very
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
common one that's a very common one um
 
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
what other services are we talking like
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
speech therapy yes yes some other
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy Physical Therapy a
 
01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
school nurse who's um like a child may
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
have a medical condition that's one of
 
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
the plans that it may be that their
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
medical condition they need insulin
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
children with diabetes is often times a
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
case requires medical services at school
 
01:24:41.629 --> 01:24:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay someone who has a chronic medical
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
condition like that so my second part to
 
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
this question now that I have that
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
Clarity on the types of services we're
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
actually talking about is if a child has
 
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
private insurance does this this maybe
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
isn't even in your department of
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
expertise but does the school district
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
build private insurance for if they have
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
needs I I don't there may be variation
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
in practice there I don't feel I know
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
enough about that to to give you a good
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
answer question for another committee
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
see I think that's an excellent question
 
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
is are is
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh covering a cost that the
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
private insurance should as well well
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
that wasn't necessarily my question
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
because we're we're talking about two
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
groups of children we're talking about
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
children covered by Medicaid and then
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about children covered
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
under private insurance right that's one
 
01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
group to me n grou they're called
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're called students in the school no
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
you have 880,000 children 990,000
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
children in the granite state covered
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid and that's what we're
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
talking about here that receive these
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
services but there are likely a large
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
number of children who are under private
 
01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
insurance through their parents employer
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
who also receive services to to meet
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
their IEP and I'm wondering if School
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
districts receive reimbursement through
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
those private insurers for those
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
services and I'm assuming the answer so
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
my question is are the school's even
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
trying to build them I don't know that's
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
a question I think for maybe Commerce
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
what committee I don't know Commerce or
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
or I don't know representative stringam
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
I would guess that they're not covered
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
OT is not not covered to be paid for by
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
the school system
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
typically if it's a traditional
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
elementary school middle school high
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
school something like
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful I can try to
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
get some information back to the
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee on that I think I went down
 
01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
another road but you answered my first
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
part which was I wanted specific
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
examples of those Services we're
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
you represent go ahead yeah
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative Neno so I'm a little
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
confused two questions here is whether
 
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's covered and whether if it's being
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
built out if it is covered I mean there
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
are two aspects that I've understood
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative T's uh question or
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative edwards's question is
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
that is that uh fair to say there really
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
two questions there is it if it's
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
covered by private insurance is it being
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
build out to the
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
private that's a question which these uh
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
professionals are not actually the ones
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
question there's a coverage question
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
first of all and then there was the the
 
01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.070 align:start position:0%
first of all and then there was the the
billing

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
billing
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
question but regarding private pay
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
insurers that's not in their purview
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thanks for the Deep dive
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
and and believe me I think it is going
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
to be worthwhile um representative
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
walner I just have one really quick
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
question is every school in New
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registered to be in this
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
program or approved to be in the program
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
so any any school that wants to be can
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
be I think we have 172 out of 1 78
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
school districts that participate um you
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
know that some really really small
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
school districts it may not be worth
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
their while based on the number of
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
students and the administrative cost of
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
it we we do um we do want to work I
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of my my view there
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
are millions I'm not saying hundreds of
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
million but
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
maybe um between maybe Six and10 Million
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
worth of funding that I think schools
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
may eventually be able to Avail
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
themselves when we can actually
 
01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
recognize their their true costs of
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
providing Services I will say that it's
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid billing and um all the
 
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
regulations around it are not a simple
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
thing to to work on we've we've worked
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
over the last number of years with the
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire charitable Foundation to
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
try to get extra technical assistance
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
beyond what the state can provide and
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
what we're hoping um is part of the
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
grant that we're getting is that we can
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're hiring a firm that's been done
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
this in other states that can help uh
 
01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
teach the school districts how to do
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
this work to maximize what's uh legally
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
available and within appropriate plan uh
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to recover costs and I think
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
this is we're being we're having to do
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
it I think it's something that I've had
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
on my mind to want to accomplish since
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
I've been the Medicaid director it's
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
just it's it's having the the transition
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
is is going to it's going to be a little
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
bit painful to to do it but I think once
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
we get on the other side of it it's
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to bring more money to schools to
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
offset their costs great thank you that
 
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
was what I wanted to know thank you okay
 
01:29:42.189 --> 01:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
so we were on uh slide oh did you have a
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
question yes I just want thank you Mr
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
chairman not to be labor the point but
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is important in fact I've had
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
Parents approach me and tell me they had
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
no clue that Medicaid was going to be
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
build for services and so forth so I'm
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to ask it a different way no
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
student without an IEP or a 504 in our
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
schools has things buildt to
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid they the schools are required
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
to get the parents' consent that's
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
something that schools are are required
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
to do in order for us to receive a
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
billing from from them and if if a
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
parent has question what was provided to
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
their child and they need access to
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
their what what was build to the school
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's something they can get from
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but every child that has
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
something build to Medicaid in this
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
state has either or both an IEP and a
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
504 is that correct yes and there's one
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
other plan type that I think called bip
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
or something like that but it's
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
essentially the same kind of thing it's
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
to help help a kid achieve their
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
education either due to a health
 
01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:51.639 align:start position:0%
condition that they're they're
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
addressing to to be able to get the
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
education that you know we're
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionally supposed to be
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
providing right thank
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
you okay one more so and I think this is
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
getting to your point is it's c can a a
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
child a student that has absolutely no
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
IEP no other plan walk into the school
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
nurse get a service that was deemed by
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
the nurse to be medically necessary and
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
have that school that's been registered
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
Bill Medicaid that would not be a
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
compliant way to access the Medicaid
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
you um so um I know in terms of clock
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
management here are we how are we doing
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
okay cost or time so far we're doing
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
good on cost
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay time okay all right so you you were
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
hoping to done by when whenever you
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
needed me to be whenever you needed us
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
that's have we done the hard part um
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
well in in some respects yes and some
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
respects no but let's uh let's aim at
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
three okay
 
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
so I think we've we've we've understand
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
understood from the conversation that
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
we've had so far that there are
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
different levels of financial
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
participation by the federal government
 
01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get into some of those
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
more I think on page 27 is just an
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
illustration of that uh um and but I'm
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
going to cover it a little bit more
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
detail on the slide or two ahead in page
 
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
28 real quickly here is just a a federal
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
map map a map of the US in terms of the
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
various minimum federal matching
 
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
percentages that exist today um New
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at the lowest level because
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
we have the one of the highest per
 
01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
capita incomes we're in New England
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're joined with Connecticut New
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Massachusetts and in terms
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
of nationally there's a list of those
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
states that are also at
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
50% um some of our neighbors like
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine because of their per
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
capita income are at a higher Federal
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
match because they have a higher level
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
of poverty if you
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
will and I I won't belabor more on that
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
slide slide 29 um is just the top
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
portion of that is just showing examples
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the federal match that exists with
 
01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.590 align:start position:0%
of the federal match that exists with
different

01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
programs and um I I'll U hit a little
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
bit more on this in terms of the last
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
line of that top chart when I talk about
 
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom chart the the here you just
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
see a a concrete example mathematically
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
of if you're at
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
90% um the the state amount is 100 the
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
federal amounts 900 and 5050 it's
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
obviously half half when we talk about
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I know the legislature will be
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
taking up the issue of the Medicaid
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax and the disproportion
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
share program the dish program is
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
historically uncompensated care um the
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
state has paid out those dollars um
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
entirely at a 50%
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
match um the the opportunity to draw a
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
higher Federal match um uh came out of
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
the expiration of the of the current
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
Arrangement um in this last session
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
where the the state has the opportunity
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
um and to use other mechanisms to draw a
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
higher Federal match um you know part of
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
the the acceptance of what we do there
 
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
is that when you use other mechanisms
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
like rates and directed payments um
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
which directed payments are basically a
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
an additional payment on top of their
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
regular payment that while you can draw
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
a higher Federal match it can only be
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
for individuals who have Medicaid
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
coverage whereas dish payments can cover
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
um and they have to be New Hampshire
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
patients um when you talk about dish it
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
can cover Medicaid uncompensated care
 
01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.950 align:start position:0%
can cover Medicaid uncompensated care
cost

01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
um uninsured costs people that don't
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
have insurance and it can cover someone
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
who um come from another state as long
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
as they're
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so in terms of balancing the
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
the what the current plan that's um
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
being implemented today you know pending
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
if there's any action this session is
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
that um there's a portion of it that's
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
paid in directed payments and in uh
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
rates that draws more fed Federal match
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and will support um you
 
01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
know funding to bring in the 74 million
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
more than we otherwise would have
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's also a piece that's paid out
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
still in um the traditional dish program
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
because there are hospitals that are not
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
advantaged by this program they you know
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
if particular if you're a border state
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
hospital that some of your uncompensated
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
care for you know people who came from
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
another state or that if you have more
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
uninsured versus insured where uh we've
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
tried to make adjustments in our formula
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
to account for that I'm sure that the
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's going to be discussion this
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
session in on that topic um but just
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
suffice it to say what I'm trying to to
 
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
bring forward today as as those
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
discussions occur is you understand that
 
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
when you you pay out a dish dollar um it
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
can only be paid at 50 50% match other
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
choices are at a higher match but they
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
also have some draw for the people
 
01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
receiving the funds and that you know
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
you can't pay out ofate Medicaid and you
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
can't pay for uncompensated care from
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
people who are have no insurance at all
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's a there's there's a lot what I
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
just talked about there but that is the
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
gist of kind of that issue in terms of
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
um why um some combination of the two is
 
01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
favored by the by the hospitals and and
 
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
and from their perspective needed by the
 
01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.070 align:start position:0%
and from their perspective needed by the
hospitals

01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know purely if it was just the state
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
perspective doing it through the other
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms has advantages in terms of
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
the amount that we we
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
draw so I think represent Stringham has
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
a question I'd like to ask a quick
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
question of the audience if if you think
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
you would like to say something at the
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the Department's
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
presentation would you raise your hand
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
oh no I'm just asking are you going to
 
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
time okay that that's I'm sorry that was
 
01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
the question I didn't say it very well
 
01:38:06.119 --> 01:38:07.430 align:start position:0%
the question I didn't say it very well
representative

01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh just uh on the issue of
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
fmap so we're at the lowest at 50% let's
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
say the uh um national average is 60% if
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
we get if if our at map share was the
 
01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
average aage we'd be looking at an extra
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
what half a billion to a billion in
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
federal money coming in I mean it's 10%
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
of uh of about uh we spend two and
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
roughly two and a half billion on
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in all parts of the department
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
so half of that um times like 1.2 times
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of money like hund and
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
something million
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
right but we can only do that if we're
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
poor that's we don't really have any
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
discrep on that unless we want to invoke
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
poverty well the the the federal reason
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
to have different rates is they believe
 
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
that uh the other states need it more is
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
that yeah I mean Mississippi is one of
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
the states that you know that where
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's more
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
poverty a larger percentage of the
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
budget is needed for Medicaid and so
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
they that it's it goes back to what
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
Congress could work out among themselves
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to Fe allocate the
 
01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
dollars to meet you know the Public's
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
need at large um the one and I will
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
address this later in the presentation
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
you know um what we call the epilog
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
section in terms of there are some risks
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
as to whether 50% is the floor or not um
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of proposals before Congress
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
and considering do do you have a slide
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
where you're talking about risks yes
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
what we what kind of odd things we might
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate from this Administration 47
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
um the last slide okay so we'll we'll
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
we'll we got something to look forward
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
to do you have another question
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
represent Stringham well I just think
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know M Michigan didn't seem to me to
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
be the most impoverished state in the
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
country and it's at
 
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
76.9% so and um it's not anything I
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
expect you to answer but in Michigan
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's 76.9 but it
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't some pretty successful car
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
companies and other businesses in Arbor
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
and so on so
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
I I'll go back and double check that
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
number for for Michigan I'm sure it's
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
right um but uh you know I think
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
um in in part that's why we have a
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
smaller Medicaid Program because we have
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
less poverty
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
um um the next slide we covered was 29
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
we've covered that um so the the ability
 
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
to draw a Federal match beyond what uh
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
just general funds savings is through
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
provider taxes and fees um and on page
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
30 is a couple of maps in terms of uh
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
provider taxes and and today um you know
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
we talked about the Medicaid enhancement
 
01:41:13.149 --> 01:41:13.159 align:start position:0%
tax um and I think um when um Chris S
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
and ello and the divisional long-term
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
Services support here they'll talk about
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
the nfq tax um and I'll talk about that
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
again on page 31 for a moment but in
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
terms of PR share and and the um the
 
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent of sort of dish the mquip
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
payment will be covered when they come
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
before you but uh suffice it to say that
 
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has used provider taxes
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
um particularly in the the hospital area
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
to generate additional Federal match um
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
through the Medicaid enhancement tax on
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
page 31 can I can I get you skip forward
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes this is a a simple um I think
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
conceptual slide of what in order to
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
draw a federal match all four of these
 
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:14.679 align:start position:0%
um boxes around the fmap acronym have to
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
be fulfilled you have to be to claim
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
fmap you have to have a person who's
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
involved enrolled in Medicaid it has to
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
be a covered service under Medicaid it
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
has to be provided by a provider who's
 
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid and it has to be
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
medically necessary these are the four
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
conditions to be able to draw a federal
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
match so if any one of these are not
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
true you you're not entitled to that
 
01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.709 align:start position:0%
true you you're not entitled to that
Federal

01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.719 --> 01:42:49.390 align:start position:0%
 
match

01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
um you want to jump ahead to um SL
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
35 um sure I I'm I'm looking for the
 
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
slide that says uh what we chose not to
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
cover in Medicaid like the long-term
 
01:43:09.629 --> 01:43:09.639 align:start position:0%
supports I think is not in there so it's
 
01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:13.239 align:start position:0%
coming up we have some things that
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
um that uh I think might get to what
 
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
your your question is in terms of what
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
we don't cover um because legislative
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
will that I I want to hear that story
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
about how legislatively when we were
 
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
looking at going to an MCO model we the
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislature determined to exempt
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
particular services from being included
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
in the MCO contract yes what and so is
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
there a slide that tells us what we left
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
out of the MCO yes um so if we getting
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
okay um so on page 43 the the top two
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
are in a form of Managed Care One is the
 
01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:08.679 align:start position:0%
sort of the requirement to be in managed
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
care for most people for their regular
 
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
health insurance and then the dental um
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
adult dental program is in a Managed
 
01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.310 align:start position:0%
adult dental program is in a Managed
Care

01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
Care
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
model um the 19 all the 1915 SE waivers
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
which is the um
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
inh home supports the acquired brain
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
disorder the DD developmental
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities waiver choices for
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
Independence are in FIFA
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
service now now to read that slightly
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
different okay uh those 1915 C's yes are
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
items that we could elect to put back
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
into the MCO
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
contracts technically there's a there's
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
a um in 20 20 I think 18 uh there was
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
legislation passed that prohibited um
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
Managed Care in this in what we call
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
long-term services and support space um
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
at one point the legislature asked the
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
department to do a study of it um we
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
brought the results back there was uh I
 
01:45:13.709 --> 01:45:13.719 align:start position:0%
think concern on the part of
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
particularly the counties and and
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
providers of being in managed care and
 
01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
um then um I think uh it was
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative NE Kirk I think at the
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
time that that put in a specific uh
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
legislative proposal which was adopted
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
that prohibited putting these services
 
01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
in so when I say we can do that that
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
means the legislature could pass a new
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
law to undo the Old Law these These are
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
items that we could determine
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
legislatively to put back into the MCO
 
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
probably not this year but that would be
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
a discussion for the future right um
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
because because these things are seem to
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
be running at a greater rate of
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
increase than uh the MCO contracts are I
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
think in part because there was many
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
many many years in which there were no
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
rate changes and I think that you know
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
last legislative session those was a in
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
I've been in New Hampshire healthcare
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
for almost 40 years in terms of what I
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
saw as the investment that the
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
legislature was willing to make and and
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
those Services I think that's that's a
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
big issue in terms of the amount of
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
money that's being spent and I think
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
that the you know we saw the system sort
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
of collapsing around the access issue um
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
during the the the pandemic um when uh
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
when that was um active um and we had I
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
think providers that was saying they
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
were ready to quit Medicaid because they
 
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay their staff um and so I
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
think that there was a significant
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
investment made then
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
um you know again I think um you know
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
programmatically I support the the in
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
the division of Medicaid we support the
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
other division of long-term services and
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
support but they're the people that
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
could give you the more in-depth
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of kind of what what's
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
gone on there right I I wanted to get
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
this into the public hearing because
 
01:47:12.669 --> 01:47:12.679 align:start position:0%
many of us are going to have people
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
coming to them telling them that we we
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
can save money if we move some of these
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
Services back up under the manag care
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
contracts and so I wanted to give you an
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sort of speak to that at
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
a at a high level or at least make
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
people aware that that's one of the
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions being floated yeah I mean I
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
think that the I can speak to it from a
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
couple different levels if that's okay
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
from the the county perspective um you
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
know the way that New Hampshire finances
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
long-term services and support is that
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
the counties make a significant probably
 
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
upwards of 90% or more of the the the
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
non-federal share and the concern there
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
is that um you know for example people
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
admitt in nursing homes that when the
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
managed care companies negotiate lower
 
01:48:08.589 --> 01:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
rates basically means that they're going
 
01:48:11.589 --> 01:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
to pay the mcos and compared to what
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
they're getting today they'll have
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
they'll get less money um there'll also
 
01:48:19.149 --> 01:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
be some concerns about um you know loss
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
of control because they're they they're
 
01:48:23.229 --> 01:48:23.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for a significant portion of
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
the services that are delivered they're
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
not only responsible for their own
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
nursing home but anybody who goes into a
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
nursing home and all the the Home and
 
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services they pick up a
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the of that cost
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that's why you know back in
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
18 um the concern was that the
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
efficiencies would come out of out of
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
effectively the the County's financing
 
01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
perspective and I think also the private
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
sector was concerned um you know it's
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
not frequent that we hear concerns from
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and the like in terms of
 
01:48:59.709 --> 01:48:59.719 align:start position:0%
their ability to make it go in New
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that concern again there that
 
01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
um you know if the manag care companies
 
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
are involved in long-term service and
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
support on the other hand I will say
 
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
that the there is a perspective that New
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could do more outside of
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
institutional care and that's where the
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
MOs may be able to bring efficiencies to
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
the the situation you know New
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's try to make more progress in
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
that area and we have in terms of you
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
know uh a day in a and the home
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
environment is about a third of the cost
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
on average of a day in the institutional
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
environment um and you know New
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has made progress but there
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
are other states that have a a higher
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
percentage in um Home and Community
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
Based Services compared to to New
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I think you know New
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been working through ways
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
that it can to do that I think there's a
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's a tension there between um you
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
know the the maybe the most effective
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
cost model for the state's purchase
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
versus what it does to the counties and
 
01:50:07.629 --> 01:50:07.639 align:start position:0%
the community Ser the community
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
agencies and so I think that you you'd
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about that with a Managed
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
Care proposal in that space But I do
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
think you know
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately um we potentially could spend
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
less um in in that area but states that
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
have gone in that Direction it's
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
important to leave yourself enough
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
Runway to implement it those states that
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
have rushed it have regretted it in a
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
big way so are are you specifically
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with Texas and something I
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
think they call the star
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
program um I do not know a lot about the
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
star program so I so there's time but um
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
but that's being floated as um kind of
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
potential model legislation for us to
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
look at I'll take a look at it than all
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
all right you you can go back to where
 
01:50:58.510 --> 01:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
you think you were yeah um so we've
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
skipped over a few pages but I think um
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
just in the interest of time here um you
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
know on P page 41 that gives you some of
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
the various vehicles that we can use the
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
the description of what they are on page
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
41 page 42 talks about the different
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
attributes of those different vehicles
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
for for adding service to the state um a
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
little education when it says section
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
1955 what I assume that means is if I go
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
to some big CMS regulation there's a
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
section 1 1915 1915 and I'm like
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
applying under that sub paragraph It's
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
actually the Social Security Act these
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
are sections from directly from the
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
Social Security Act oh okay great thank
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
you and so there are different different
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
flexibilities there are allowed on under
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Act to to deliver
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
Services um and we've used the SE
 
01:52:01.629 --> 01:52:01.639 align:start position:0%
waivers are are probably our most common
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
ones in fact if you turn to um what
 
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
would be slide 45 I see the page number
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
fell off there there's a there's a
 
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
waiver wheel which Ann I think um shared
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
with you in the original presentation um
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
but these are all the things that New
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has in place that we've
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
um taken advantage of the state plan
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
being sort of the core of what we do and
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
then the different things that we have
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
in place to uh provide typically what
 
01:52:36.510 --> 01:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
these waivers entail is that for certain
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
populations like someone who's
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled it makes sense
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
to give them additional Services beyond
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
the traditional health insurance plan
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
because that's going to you know lead to
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
Better Health for them um and so um you
 
01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
know choices for independent is
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
basically allowing people to you know
 
01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
make a personal choice what's best for
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
them and to there's a cost advantage to
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
to to the state um you know there the in
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
home so so there's not enough time today
 
01:53:09.629 --> 01:53:09.639 align:start position:0%
but if each of us wanted to get to
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
understand these boxes that are around
 
01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
the wheel of the state plan these These
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
are documented somewhere where we can
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
read them and understand them hopefully
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
we have we have summaries of them
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
actually they appear in the states when
 
01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
they do Bond appendix a they're in there
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly make something like
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
that from there available as well as
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
give you links to the the entire waiver
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I I I want to summarize
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
something to make sure that I understand
 
01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
it and and put it into simple terms for
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
uh newer members um
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
so uh the department will come to us
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
with a a budget for Medicaid
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
that budget number as I understand it
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
represents your very best guess of what
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
our total expenditures under Medicaid
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
will be and you'll have factored in uh
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
all of our eligibilities and what the
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
likely populations will be there and
 
01:54:15.149 --> 01:54:15.159 align:start position:0%
you'll factor in all of the um uh
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
utilization the the ways in which people
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
can get covered
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
care uh and and you'll do an analysis of
 
01:54:26.669 --> 01:54:26.679 align:start position:0%
that and then that really drops to what
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
the budget request is is is that so
 
01:54:32.069 --> 01:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
right so far typically I think what you
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
see is the agency budget next to the
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and um and then we
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
answer questions about about that no I'm
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
asking about the process I'm not I'm not
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
asking any dollar numbers I'm just
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get it straight that that the
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget ends up having to be the
 
01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
the the our best guess of the the number
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
of people who are eligible multiplied by
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
the utilization of the eligible services
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
and that creates a number it does but it
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
appears in in in in division of Medicaid
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
services it appears in the Managed Care
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
contract line 7948 of B for the Managed
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
Care population for nursing facilities
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
will appear in a different director's uh
 
01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
budget but okay but and so so then the
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
reality is that's an estimate and if and
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
if we're off if for some reason
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility jumps or or some changes in
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
eligibility or um um services are are
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
are made then then that will drive a
 
01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:41.430 align:start position:0%
are made then then that will drive a
number

01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
automatically that we owe the providers
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not it was in
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
the budget if it's in excess of our
 
01:55:51.629 --> 01:55:51.639 align:start position:0%
budget in other words we we kind of have
 
01:55:54.589 --> 01:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
no control we have awareness and
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
estimates but we don't have control over
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
the final Medicaid spend we I would say
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we have some control we've you know
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
in the years that I've been Medicaid
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
director for seven plus years now I
 
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
think in terms of in terms of the
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's been made we've
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
been able to work within it based on the
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
estimates we developed we work with our
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
actuaries we um on the you know the
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Managed Care contracts so $1.2
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
billion total
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
expenditure we we put a lot of time and
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
effort into um developing the estimate
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
because if we get that number wrong
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're in that's almost half the
 
01:56:37.149 --> 01:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
whole spend in Medicaid so um you know
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's that we've we've been able to
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
work within the appropriation that we've
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
had all all of those all of those years
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
and I anticipate that you know um we'll
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
continue to make that so what kind of
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
control knobs do you have then when you
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
say you you work within an appropriation
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
do you can't you can't modify the the
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
legal eligibility standards on the and
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
and and you're not changing the covered
 
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
Services what what kind of what kind of
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
knobs do you have to twist to to to make
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
adjustments after an appropriation is
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
done um this is the slide I wanted to
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
cover that we didn't which is Jonathan
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
we had Jonathan intended to but we have
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
different programs that we put in place
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
to help um control things if we could
 
01:57:28.189 --> 01:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
let Jonathan maybe speak to a few of
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
those it give you some sense of you know
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest ones is is the
 
01:57:35.069 --> 01:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals you know that's 31% of
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
our total medical spend um and you know
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
we we've put new things in place with
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care contract based on the
 
01:57:44.189 --> 01:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
velocity of changes that are occurring
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
with the prescription drug Market um but
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'll let you explain three of them if
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
you would sure can go over just three
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
many of them but so this is part of our
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
road map and being accountable to you
 
01:58:00.189 --> 01:58:00.199 align:start position:0%
and using those uh taxpayers dollars uh
 
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as possible um so we know
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
that the pharmaceutical spend is
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
drastically increasing
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh slide
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
see the the we let's see the py graph on
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
on slide 38 eight shows where your do
 
01:58:26.589 --> 01:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
dollars go in
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and you'll see essentially
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
uh a quarter of the Medicaid spend now
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
goes to pharmaceutical services so it's
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
25% outpatient drugs and then you add in
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
the additional drugs that are
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
administered in the hospital setting and
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
you get up to 31% of the of your cost
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
now being
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals that's increased by
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
double over the last 10% of 10 years so
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
you're seeing a trajectory there that we
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
want to have levers and control over and
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
so in the most recent uh contract this
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
is your largest state contracts with the
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
mcos that went into into place in
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
September a 5-year contract we wanted to
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
get some better controls over that state
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
spend and make sure it's medically
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate we know there's waste we
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
know that there's waste all the time in
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
the system you think look at anybody's
 
01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:23.189 align:start position:0%
the system you think look at anybody's
uh

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh closet or medication cabinets you see
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
lots of drugs that are not used that's
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
been money paid out and for Medicaid
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries that's wasted tax dollars
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
money in some cases so we call this
 
01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes poly Pharmacy the
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
overprescribing or uh a fragmented
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Health Care System where one provider
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what the other provider is
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
prescribing and you get drugs prescribed
 
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
to people that interact with each other
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
or uh or they just don't need to be on
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
and so we put some controls in place on
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
this now we were paying in the past the
 
02:00:00.189 --> 02:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Organization something to
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
do a comprehensive medication review but
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
they don't they're not in the lever
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
point to be able to control what's being
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
prescribed or taken or filled by a
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
beneficiary primarily it's the primary
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
care provider who has the best vantage
 
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
point and so it's lifted some of the
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
funds that were being paid to the mcos
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
out of the contract and for the next 5
 
02:00:23.229 --> 02:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
years we're directing those funds to the
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
primary care providers having them do
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
something called a comprehensive
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
medication review that during their
 
02:00:32.669 --> 02:00:32.679 align:start position:0%
office visit we'll pay them a nominal
 
02:00:37.470 --> 02:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
amount but appropriate uh to do a review
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
not only what they're prescribing but
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to have data fed to them
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
from the manag Care organizations of all
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
the other drugs being prescribed by the
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
other providers it's not in their the
 
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
medical record of the the
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
beneficiary so the idea then is this is
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
going to then cut down on inappropriate
 
02:00:56.069 --> 02:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
prescribing there's a few other
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that we have in place go
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
ahead yes repres so this is fascinating
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
um uh do you have what what is the
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
incentive of the primary care doctor to
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
make the hard decision where they look
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
at it and they go you're prescribed uh
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
medic medication x uh why would do just
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
as well so I'm going to move you to why
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
to save some
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
money what what is the the incentive
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
there and is it that would that be the
 
02:01:26.109 --> 02:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
same incentive for them to look at it
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
and go you've been prescribed 20 each of
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
these and you really only need 10 you
 
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
know so so where where why would a
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
primary care doctor want to do the right
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
thing when it causes them to have a
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of conf work and conflict
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
with the patient right well I think most
 
02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
primary care providers want to do the
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
right thing they want the right
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
medication at the right time for the
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
right patient and so we're going to pay
 
02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
them now in the past they were never
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
paid for this they were just expected to
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
do this in their office visit without
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
any additional renumeration so we're
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to pay them for that very small
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
amount of money compared to when you
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
think about uh what pharmaceutical cost
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
this taxpayers there's other mechanisms
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
in place to get what we talking about we
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
have for a number of years now I think
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
three the last 5year contract something
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
called a common formulary where we have
 
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
first line medications that for any
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
medical condition uh are the only
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
medication that you can get as a patient
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
or beneficiary of Medicaid without
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
having additional scrutiny something
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
called a prior authorization
 
02:02:38.069 --> 02:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
process a lot of criticism of the PRI
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
authorization process nationally but you
 
02:02:41.709 --> 02:02:41.719 align:start position:0%
haven't heard so much about the Medicaid
 
02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
Program you've he about it in other
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
areas the Medicaid Program primarily
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is making sure that
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
individuals have access to a medication
 
02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
in every single drug class
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it is available um and we've so it's
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate but it's also in
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
the best interest of taxpayers because
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
we've looked at the total cost of each
 
02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
of those of the different drug options
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
in each of those drug
 
02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
classes and have looked at the rebates
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
amount what is actually financially best
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
for the State uh in making those
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
decisions while making sure it's
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate the comp um so
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
there are other mechanisms now that's
 
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
really driving these increasing costs
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
and that's new medications new
 
02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals hitting the market some
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
amazing technology cell and Gene
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
therapies we've had uh there's children
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
now with some rare conditions called um
 
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
spinal muscular atrophy there's sickle
 
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
cell anemia some conditions now now that
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
are being amazingly cured with these new
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
very very high cost medications and
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
we've had an increase I think in the
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
last last year we've had about 10 cases
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't had any Cel anemia cases on
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
these medications yet but we've had the
 
02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
spinal muscular atrophy and other
 
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
conditions where this drug cost you know
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
one2 million for one dosage of the
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
medication so in the past those were
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
carved out of the Medicaid contracts and
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
so those were all incurred direct cost
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers out carved out now what we
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
have done is we have put them back into
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the MCO process we're sharing the
 
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
risk with them utilizing their National
 
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
expertise their their ability to uh
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
enact proper utilization
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
management and we've created a high-risk
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
pool though to uh that they can draw
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
down from for some of those highrisk
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
high cost medications we think we're
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
getting ahead of what is to be seen I
 
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
looked just looked this morning at the
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
National Drug pipeline expected
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
medications to get approved from the FDA
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it's it's vast and very high cost
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I think what our method does is
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
getting ahead of that to get those costs
 
02:05:02.189 --> 02:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
contained in a medically appropriate
 
02:05:05.229 --> 02:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
way so does the commissioner already
 
02:05:07.149 --> 02:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
have that Authority or does the
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature need to provide additional
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
Authority U for working with the mcos to
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
set some of those parameters because
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
basically the other word here that it's
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
worth avoiding generally is we're
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
rationing care right and and does the
 
02:05:28.990 --> 02:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner have a sufficient authority
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
to to set it up so that we can make some
 
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
make the right decisions we are under
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
obligations in our state plan to provide
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
all medically necessary care of of those
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory Services Pharmacy obviously is
 
02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
an optional service but it's so El link
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
I mean pharmace pharmaceutical Services
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
is a huge part of just what we do in
 
02:05:52.589 --> 02:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
medicine these days to treat people so
 
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
it's so linked with it I I there is some
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
place where we need some help um and
 
02:06:01.390 --> 02:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
that is the state statute requires what
 
02:06:04.589 --> 02:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
we call generics first and meaning that
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
we need to use generic drugs
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
preferentially over brand name drugs
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
however in the Medicaid Program based on
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
the discounts that are available to the
 
02:06:14.719 --> 02:06:15.910 align:start position:0%
the discounts that are available to the
Medicaid

02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
Program um the net cost to us is cheaper
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes a lower net cost to use the
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
brand name when you take into account
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
the the rebates that we receive um I'm
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
hoping you'll see legislation this
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
session to allow Medicaid to be able to
 
02:06:38.549 --> 02:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
purchase drugs at um so that sounds
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable but are we past the Hope
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
stage though are you aware of any
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that's believe that there's
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
Senator gray is introducing legislation
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
on Thursday this week uh that will allow
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
the state to have the authority to uh
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
very good have the best rebates options
 
02:06:57.629 --> 02:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
even if it's brand name because
 
02:06:59.229 --> 02:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes the brand name will be cheaper
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
than the generic right so so I I do
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
think that between that what we're just
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
talking about legislative proposal what
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
Dr ballad was still uh laid out to you
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
that those that's just the the pharmacy
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
area um and you know we have other um
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
programs that we use to um incent the
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
mcos on on performance um we have a we
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
call a withhold program to achieve
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
certain quality objectives oftentimes
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
quality is connected to cost in terms of
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
um managing for certain outcomes like
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know in the news there been a lot
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
about lead testing you know we have in a
 
02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
withhold arrangement to improve the
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
level of lead testing um and we have uh
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
also um certain measures on penalties
 
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
that we can um assess what we call a
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
remedy or a collect a fee if they're not
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
meeting contract obligations I think
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to tighten up all the
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
areas that we can tighten up in that
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
Managed Care program that are
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate and and generally would be
 
02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:06.679 align:start position:0%
enhancing quality not taking away from
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
it the other area that we talked about
 
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
at the uh commissioner's opening was
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
around the Coordinated Care the primary
 
02:08:14.589 --> 02:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
care services so we have these
 
02:08:16.589 --> 02:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
mechanisms within our
 
02:08:18.549 --> 02:08:18.559 align:start position:0%
contract uh but we still have those
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
obligations if we're going to have a
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program to do those state plan
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
programs as you say and there is
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
certainly a fixed cost to
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
that U representative noan yes the
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
question I have is how does this uh
 
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
overlap with the right to right to try
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and experimental drugs I a lot of the
 
02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
things you're talking about fall into
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
the category of experimental drugs which
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
usually weren't covered under a lot of
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
situations but it seems to me the the
 
02:08:52.549 --> 02:08:52.559 align:start position:0%
right to try legislation has some some
 
02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
cost elements to it I'm wondering how
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
that uh coverage Works representative
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question so in
 
02:09:01.549 --> 02:09:01.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we do not pay for experimental
 
02:09:04.589 --> 02:09:04.599 align:start position:0%
drugs right to try Federal legislation
 
02:09:08.589 --> 02:09:08.599 align:start position:0%
refers to FDA studies and NIH studies
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
and that as a study is ongoing allows
 
02:09:14.109 --> 02:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
access to that medication uh to a person
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
who's not enrolled in the study and it's
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
really on the drug manufacturers to to
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
work with the the person who's wanting
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
that medication to allow them access
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
it's totally separate from anything we
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
do in Medicaid so so it doesn't play
 
02:09:29.229 --> 02:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
into the cost equation so far as the
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
state is concerned that's correct
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
sir represent
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh well thank you for I mean
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
this is a longer conversation that we've
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
had on Pharmaceuticals than we had all
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
in the last uh uh last two year by Anum
 
02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh very frustrating because there's uh
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
so little um flexibility in what drugs
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
are covered there's so little
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility in how much we pay for at
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
least one drug in each class and um and
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh no no real ability to uh adjust
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
copays and so on so um uh it's not
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
surprising that this part of the
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid spend is growing faster than uh
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
some of the other um other areas of the
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh budget um you know I I know
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
there's at least 50 drugs that plan to
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
Target a a user price of at least a
 
02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars out there that we may
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
find uh one or more patients uh in in
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
the State uh in the Medicaid Program um
 
02:10:44.109 --> 02:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh would be you know may benefit from
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
and you know frankly Frank FR frankly I
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
find that kind of hard because I know
 
02:10:52.350 --> 02:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
how much a million dollar
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
could do if we spread it around um you
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
know 10,000 Medicaid recipients or
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
others around the state uh but um uh the
 
02:11:05.069 --> 02:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
way the national drug laws are written
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
that if it's reasonable and medically
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
necessary uh for the patient and you're
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid Program you have to
 
02:11:15.629 --> 02:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
provide it and there's no uh flexibility
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
on price on that side of things if if
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
that sound reasonably accurate on it it
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
does I think another component that's
 
02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
being looked at is um medical utility as
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
well I think you see some states using
 
02:11:30.599 --> 02:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
well I think you see some states using
that

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
language um when they consider test like
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
biomarkers so that's another rising cost
 
02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
nationally is biomarker testing we cover
 
02:11:43.069 --> 02:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
biomarkers in New Hampshire is
 
02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
particularly useful in some treatments
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
for Cancer Care uh but we do it on a
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
case-by Case basis looking at the
 
02:11:52.549 --> 02:11:52.559 align:start position:0%
utility in each situ situation so that's
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that we're looking
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
at very closely so I think you're
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
referring to you know you have to have a
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh analytical validity for a new test
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
that it's consistent you need clinical
 
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
validity and that it tells you some
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
information and then you need uh uh the
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
kind of utility that says you can do
 
02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
something you know the fact that the
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
weather you had a perfect weather report
 
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
if you're not going outside or doesn't
 
02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
change anything doesn't there's no
 
02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
reason to pay for something that doesn't
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
change that doesn't provide information
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
that provides uh uh a change in in
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
medical uh care going forward is that
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to there yes sir
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I'm referring to so
 
02:12:36.639 --> 02:12:37.669 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I'm referring to so
and

02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
um uh I did want to ask um so there's
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
lack of flexibility in a lot of the
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical pricing uh um but some of
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
the other Medicaid uh uh areas um isn't
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
their ability to uh compress uh the
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
amount you pay for a service if you
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be used so much that
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to blow out the budget um
 
02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:08.559 align:start position:0%
and one example might be nursing homes
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh that I know there's a you know some
 
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
kind of compression factor that goes in
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
much like way the federal government
 
02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
does for the hospital
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
outpatient um uh fee schedule the
 
02:13:22.109 --> 02:13:22.119 align:start position:0%
inpatient fee schedule and the physician
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
fee schedule when they expect to have
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
greater utilization they just compress
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
the amount they pay per per Service Unit
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you there's a certain amount of
 
02:13:33.549 --> 02:13:33.559 align:start position:0%
that but I think the the nursing home
 
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
one will be covered in another session
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
but you know we pay inpatient cases on a
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
um diagnostic Related Group the case
 
02:13:44.109 --> 02:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
rate um and so that's one way that we
 
02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
control it I I do I'm hoping that I can
 
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
hit the last slide before we break here
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
um the last slide's the potential
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
changes coming yes okay so so I'm going
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
to give you a segue here too and that is
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh I don't want to ask you direct
 
02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
questions about hb1 or hb2 I'll just say
 
02:14:06.549 --> 02:14:06.559 align:start position:0%
that if you need some legislative
 
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
assistance with any of this please make
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
sure that the the governor hands us a an
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
hb2 item to look
 
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
at yes sir so um and then you know just
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
for more context on this uh this
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh Management Area represents
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
12% of all the general funds the state
 
02:14:32.669 --> 02:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
spends so it's a it's a big it's a big
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
number so and 12% of the department
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
budget yeah no that's 12% of the
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
department budget not all funds so go go
 
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
ahead I think you want to talk about 47
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
yes um you know if some of these
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
proposals are adopted I think it it U
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
will be a different conversation that
 
02:14:54.910 --> 02:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
we'll need to have um but um you know
 
02:14:57.629 --> 02:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
one obviously is the change in the the
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion Federal match from
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
90% um there's also a proposal to lower
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
the floor of the fmap From Below 50% to
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
potentially going as low as
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
40% um and then
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh there's also
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
discussions uh about uh going to like a
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
block grant per capita funding um at a
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
state level I mean we looked at this I
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
think a couple legislation legislative
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
sessions before maybe back in 18 17 type
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
of time frame you know it depends on the
 
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions around a a block
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
grant kind of situation um and then
 
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest one you know would
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the Medicaid enhancement tax
 
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
the the the uh tax that's used to
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
generate the mquip payment for nursing
 
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
homes um there could be there proposals
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of uh level of tax
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
where 6% is the current cap but there
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
are some proposals to go five or four or
 
02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
three or two um and those would have a
 
02:16:10.750 --> 02:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
significant impact on on the state there
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
there are additional there's a list of
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
of additional ones that are that are out
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
there as well um terms of the ability to
 
02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
use directed payments the ability to um
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
have other flexibilities that we have
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
today that um would you know increase
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of General funds that would
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
be required to sustain the programs and
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
so um a lot of this is going to come up
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
in the continuing reconciliation act um
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
this coming
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
um March April time frame another one is
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know the amount of disproportionate
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
share funds that states are allotted um
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
if the Contin if there's not a
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution New Hampshire's um
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
amount of funds that we could draw would
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
be reduced from a little over 200
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
million to under a 100 million and um we
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
expect that probably Congress won't
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
adopt that but there is a risk if they
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
can't come to an agreement that you we
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
could see a significant drop there all
 
02:17:14.669 --> 02:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
these things if if they were to one or
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
more of them would happen I think we
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
have to have a different discussion than
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're having today in terms of how we
 
02:17:23.309 --> 02:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
and uh so our our goal is to keep you
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
informed along the
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
way let's tease that out how will you
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
keep us informed along the
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
way we we like if you read a good
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
article I mean I don't know how you get
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
your information whether it's you're
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
you're paying attention to
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
the some bulletin somewhere you're
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
talking to your peers so National
 
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid directors I'm on the board of
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
the national Medicaid directors and um
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know through that organization and
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
um also the the Commissioners on uh um
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
and a a group of Commissioners and our
 
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
long-term Services support folks have a
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
group and I think that information
 
02:18:10.669 --> 02:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
typically is you know we're meeting
 
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
every week to get legislative updates I
 
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
think when there's something that's
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
that's either of concern that we need to
 
02:18:19.469 --> 02:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention or something
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
that's now baked ready for consideration
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
I mean I could communicate to the this
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
this committee and send you an an email
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
of that and if you feel like you want us
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
to come in and talk to you about it be
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
willing to do that too at any time you
 
02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
know I I won't I won't prescribe how you
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
do it I just want you to know that I'm I
 
02:18:42.669 --> 02:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your offer to keep us
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
informed and I I would like to be kept
 
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
inform formed because that stuff is
 
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
moving pretty quick yes um I mean last
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
week uh you know the when the the whole
 
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
change and just trying to find out
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
what's going on within 24 hours is you
 
02:18:59.309 --> 02:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
know the amount of information that I
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
learned hour to hour and that was really
 
02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
important uh to fortunately um you know
 
02:19:07.950 --> 02:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
our funds reopen back up to be able to
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
draw but you know something like like an
 
02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
issue where we're going to have a change
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect us we really to
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
get that information out to you I I
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to obligate you to overc
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
communicating either CU I I know a lot
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
of it it's just Chasing Ghosts until
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
things start to form but um now this is
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
a list of uh risks which are all
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
negative these are these are threats do
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
do we see any happy risks do we see any
 
02:19:38.589 --> 02:19:38.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities is there in this chaos and
 
02:19:41.389 --> 02:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity for somebody to go to DC and
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
say you know what would be really great
 
02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
is if we could get you know the the the
 
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
healthy worker um off of Medicaid for
 
02:19:54.030 --> 02:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
example yeah so I know um one of the
 
02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
areas that they expect there to be um
 
02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
either legislation or um Federal
 
02:20:02.590 --> 02:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
guidance is around the work requirement
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
which we're talking I think about and I
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
know this
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
session there's a there's legislation to
 
02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
be um considered I think one of the
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
things um about that is I think you know
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
um that you could help with is making
 
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we um you know we spent quite
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
a bit of money setting up the current
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
work requirement that's in legislation
 
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that um we understand
 
02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
clearly what the picture is federally
 
02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
before we you know start spending money
 
02:20:36.349 --> 02:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
I know that this is one of the tightest
 
02:20:38.910 --> 02:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
budgets that that we'll all go through
 
02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
and um you know in terms of just the
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
timing on the runway to do something I
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
think is important on that topic um so
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
so I've just heard rumors that somebody
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
has a bill to do
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
to come back to workers requirements
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire yeah I I'm I'm
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
expecting that that there'll be
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
something this session on on that just
 
02:21:03.070 --> 02:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
because I think it's nationally uh very
 
02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh discussed topic is there anything
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
else do we want some more flexibility on
 
02:21:11.309 --> 02:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
eligibility or the kind of care provided
 
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
I mean so so I think in terms of the the
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
flexibilities around um um there's
 
02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
regulation for example on the nursing
 
02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
homes and um on the Staffing personel
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
requirement that's pretty new right that
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
that potentially could be um there could
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
be some relief there there could be some
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
additional flexibilities around How We
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
Do eligibility um in terms of uh um
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
whether all the regulations that were
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
were published last uh spring whether
 
02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
there'll be some relief in terms of the
 
02:21:48.270 --> 02:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
the timing on on that I think those will
 
02:21:51.389 --> 02:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
take different actions um but
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
and you're you're working those with the
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner or you need legislative uh
 
02:21:59.550 --> 02:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to be included I you know at
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
this point
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
um I think I would need to to take a
 
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
look at at which ones we might have to I
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
can share that I think um when it comes
 
02:22:12.670 --> 02:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
to changing certain eligibilities uh
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
certain processes we would need that
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
certainly work requirements we would
 
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
need legislative um help there so I just
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know I'm from the
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
government and I'm here to
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
help I am
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
too not representive
 
02:22:32.429 --> 02:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you irrespective of what
 
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
happens at the federal government it
 
02:22:35.710 --> 02:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
would seem that the one of the goals of
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
the department would try to raise a
 
02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
person's standard to the point where
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
they can get off of Medicaid right and
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
to that to that end uh what is the
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
department uh doing or undertaking as a
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
goal to try to redu the number of people
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid so I think um return you
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
know one thing is to make sure that the
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
people who are on Medicaid are actually
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid right um and that
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
we in terms of our eligibility
 
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
capabilities um you know there's always
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
room for improvement I will will say
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
that but you know we were able to
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
effectively um you know work to get our
 
02:23:19.269 --> 02:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
um elig people who are not eligible for
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
the program um moved off of of coverage
 
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of of that and I think in terms
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
of making sure that we we give people um
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
um a good chance to provide information
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and to um make sure my goal every day is
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that someone who's eligible
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
maintains their eligibility someone who
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
isn't that we you know need to try to
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
support them either through exchange
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
coverage or some other option um but
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's I mean ultimately I think our
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the department is to
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know run eligibility as it is but
 
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
also other things that we do outside of
 
02:24:00.670 --> 02:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program um directly or in
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
some of the program areas you know
 
02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
helping someone get to a point where um
 
02:24:07.469 --> 02:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're able to to
 
02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
function and work and you know
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
transition from not being able to work
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
because of a health condition to being
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
able to to work and self-support
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
themselves there's you know other
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
Federal programs that are designed to
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
help people lift people up and out and I
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
think you know a good example of that is
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
our 1115 waiver that the component
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
regarding Community re-entry is
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
individuals who have the state has
 
02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
invested money while they're behind bars
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
if you will um and um the ability to to
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
bring um support so that once they enter
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
the community all that good work to try
 
02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
to uh keep them on the right track to
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
being able to to not have medical issues
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
result in a relapse of them going back
 
02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
to prison as an example um so I think
 
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
there are things that we're trying to do
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
to you know as we should within the and
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's the benefit of having us all
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
under one umbrella of the leveraging up
 
02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
the different opportunities to to allow
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.469 --> 02:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
program are there any questions from the
 
02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
committee do do do you do you all have
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
any closing remarks or additional things
 
02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:22.630 align:start position:0%
any closing remarks or additional things
to

02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
add thank you for your time and
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
attention for sure this is this is
 
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
something that we've skimmed over in
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
previous budgets and I I I even when I
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
was on HHS I never really fully
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
understood the the depth of this program
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
so so I appreciate that and I think
 
02:25:41.269 --> 02:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's still more to learn you know we
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
could have taken another hour with the
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
easy I think but um to go over all the
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
waivers more specifically but is is
 
02:25:52.269 --> 02:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
anyone in the audience care to make any
 
02:25:55.389 --> 02:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
comments ask any questions little bit of
 
02:25:58.510 --> 02:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
an open Forum opportunity jump
 
02:26:02.590 --> 02:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
ball okay oh yes come on up uh there's a
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
a mic right there at the end of this
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
long table and you you can you can sit
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
there and you can hit that button to
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
make it red and just bring it towards
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
your mouth not quite as easy as it
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
sounded um Carolyn virtue granite
 
02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
caseman management the one thing that I
 
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
would like to say about the waivers is
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
that they were never in the
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
mcos so it wouldn't be bringing them
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
back it would be adding them to and um
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
discussion around that as Henry said in
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
2018 and um it was not found to be a
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
great idea and I'm not sure it would be
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
um found to be a great idea now but um
 
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
you know if that's your plan it should
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
be fully vetted thank you there is no
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
plan this was a con I just want to jump
 
02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
on the word plan there is no plan we
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
have no intention than to talk being
 
02:27:19.269 --> 02:27:19.279 align:start position:0%

don't have one scheduled but I was going
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
to ask if this coming Monday the 10th at
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
1M would work for the remaining pre
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
pre-budget presentations from the
 
02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:50.349 align:start position:0%
pre-budget presentations from the
Department

02:27:50.349 --> 02:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
it it would for me it'll give everyone a
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
chance to look at their calendar okay it
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
VP

02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:06.990 --> 02:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
yeah but what do you have a a short list
 
02:28:09.309 --> 02:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
of topics like like I want to I want to
 
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
hit the UNH contracts at some point so
 
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's something I could discuss with
 
02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
the Department as cover uh to cover
 
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
during their Public Health presentation
 
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
which is one that's coming up up um also
 
02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
developmental Services which was
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
previously um delayed and elderly and
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
adult which was also previously delayed
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
and that would include a discussion of
 
02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility financing okay so
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a really big day or do
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
do we need to make those two days I
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
think one day would work starting at 1M
 
02:28:43.710 --> 02:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
start earlier then or ask few your
 
02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
questions you could start earlier if the
 
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
committee would
 
02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:48.190 align:start position:0%
committee would
[Music]

02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
prefer uh
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
what's 10:00 look like for people 10:00
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
and then we'll take a a lunch and we'll
 
02:28:56.399 --> 02:28:57.469 align:start position:0%
and then we'll take a a lunch and we'll
come

02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:29:00.670 --> 02:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
back you can't can you come anytime on
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
on the 10th representative Daniels uh
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
one one o00 actually works very well for
 
02:29:08.590 --> 02:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
me okay
 
02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:11.790 align:start position:0%
me okay
um

02:29:11.790 --> 02:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
so let's start it let's go ahead and
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
start at one I'm a little nervous
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like a pretty full
 
02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:24.550 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like a pretty full
plate

02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
well what yeah pencil Us in another date
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
for a fall back and I don't know if if
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
we've missed the window for the calendar
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
I I no you haven't okay so so go ahead
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
and pencil Us in for an overflow um and
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
then we can cancel it if we don't need
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
it okay sounds good
 
02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
okay anything else thank you so much I
 
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I know that's a lot of
 
02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
preparation and particularly I don't
 
02:29:54.269 --> 02:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
think you've given this slide deck
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
before so this was a new build all fresh
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
