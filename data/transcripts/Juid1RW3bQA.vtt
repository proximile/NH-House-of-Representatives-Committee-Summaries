people that are addressing the committee
 
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
the step up to the election there
 
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 align:start position:0%

thank you um
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%

your neighbor to the north uh slow
 
00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.949 align:start position:0%
your neighbor to the north uh slow
encounter

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
encounter
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
i want to correct a new statement that
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
has been repeated in previous meetings
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
and among the general public
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
it is not true that the new hampshire
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
constitution requires that towns that
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
are large enough to have their own
 
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.949 align:start position:0%
are large enough to have their own
representative

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
it's all district c
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's the quotation from
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
minutes of a previous meeting
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
as are these others it is not true
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
that new one is constitutional
 
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
guaranteed its own district
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative or that canaan is legally
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
entitled to its own representative
 
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.749 align:start position:0%
entitled to its own representative
district

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
it is not true
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
that in 2011
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
152 towns were eligible
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
but 62 of those towns did not receive
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
their own house district
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
violating the constitution as amended
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
what the new hampshire constitution says
 
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.469 align:start position:0%
what the new hampshire constitution says
is

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
when the population of any counter order
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
according to last federal census
 
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
is within a reasonable deviation from
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
the ideal population
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
for one or more representative seats
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
the tower war shall have its own
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
district of one or more representative
 
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.909 align:start position:0%
district of one or more representative
seats

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
seats
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
the key phrase is reasonable deviation
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
a town is not entitled to its own
 
00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.749 align:start position:0%
a town is not entitled to its own
district

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
just by being large
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
its population must be within a
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable deviation of the idea
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
the one that's population is 4 400 which
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a deviation of 28 percent
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
far beyond what anybody can see that
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
considers reasonable
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
canaan's deviation is 10
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
which is beyond the guideline for reason
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
in 2011 there were 152 towns with large
 
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.189 align:start position:0%
in 2011 there were 152 towns with large
population

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
but most of them
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
were beyond reasonable deviations
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
i estimate that about 30 tabs were
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
within reasonable deviations
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at the legislative history
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the constitutional amendment the
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
voters passed in 2006
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
you will see that the bill as introduced
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
said that when a town award has enough
 
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.250 align:start position:0%
said that when a town award has enough
inhabitants

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 align:start position:0%
inhabitants

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
it shall have its own district
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
that was the bill as introduced
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
that is not the bill that was passed by
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
the general court and passed by the
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
voters the language the voters approved
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
was the language about with a reasonable

walpole's population deviation is 5.5
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
which is barely outside the guidelines
 
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.189 align:start position:0%
which is barely outside the guidelines
reasonable

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
personally i think that's a very
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable stretch from the guideline
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
and very justifiable under redistricting
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
case law
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
the keen wards
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
deviate 34
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
from ideal population
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
they are not entitled to their own
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
districts even though they're quite a
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
bit larger
 
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.230 align:start position:0%
bit larger
than

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
the size of a
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
an ideal district
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
i urge the committee to look at the
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
actual language of the constitution
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
not what various people think it says
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
please do not attempt to give every
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
large town its own district
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
i have seen maps that started out by
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
making every large town its own district
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
but then they had to face unreasonable
 
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.390 align:start position:0%
but then they had to face unreasonable
deviations

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
deviations
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
and they did it by creating
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
large and ugly floaterial districts
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
that defeated the intent
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
do attempt
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the huge material districts
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
from the entire map now cheshire does
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
not have
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
any huge material districts
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
but next door hillsborough has some
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
really ugly floaters and my county
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
sullivan has one
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
pretty ugly
 
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.670 align:start position:0%
pretty ugly
plateau

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
plateau
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
so please do attempt to eliminate the
 
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
so please do attempt to eliminate the
materials

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
except for a case like lebanon where um
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
the wards are such a size that each ward
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
could be its own district and then a
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
floatarium would be that large covering
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.309 align:start position:0%
the entire
city

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
city
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good use of so tyrion's
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
but again some of the ones we have right
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
now are just
 
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.829 align:start position:0%
now are just
ugly

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
ugly
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
please do attempt to create small
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
districts that meet the intent of the
 
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.269 align:start position:0%

even if you slightly stretch the
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
deviation guidelines as i said for
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%

00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
census table which is handed out tonight
 
00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
census table which is handed out tonight
um

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.130 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.350 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
and each senate district you would think
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh will have between 55
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand uh
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
people that it represents
 
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.110 align:start position:0%
people that it represents
um

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
you would think then that cheshire
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
county would be represented in the
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
senate by two
 
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.509 align:start position:0%
senate by two
senators

00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
senators
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
or two senate districts
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
currently

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.670 align:start position:0%
currently
while

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
i represent 15 of the 23 towns in
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
the remaining eight are peeled off into
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
three other senate districts
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
um so there is
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
very little
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.629 align:start position:0%
uh in
influence

00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
influence
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
in those other three senate districts
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
of those towns it happens that in the
 
00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:30.790 align:start position:0%
of those towns it happens that in the
second

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
that senator ward is from cheshire
 
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.990 align:start position:0%
that senator ward is from cheshire
county

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
and a small town
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
in her senate district
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
which is largely in sullivan's county
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
and hillsborough an odd district
 
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.949 align:start position:0%
and hillsborough an odd district
um

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
nonetheless my point is
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh i would recommend to the body that
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
you think of cheshire economy as falling
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
into two senate districts
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh so that the
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
common interest
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the county uh is
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
represented in two districts
 
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.990 align:start position:0%
represented in two districts
um

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
and to carry that a little bit further
 
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
and to carry that a little bit further
uh

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
the school districts that are
 
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.230 align:start position:0%
the school districts that are
represented

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
in cheshire county would be the keene
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh the monadnock school district uh
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
which happens to line up in two senate
 
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.389 align:start position:0%
which happens to line up in two senate
districts

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
um kinsdale and winchester and fall
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
mountain they're all in my
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
also

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
having towns in cheshire county would be
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
the conval or contoucast valley school
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
district and the jaffrey rings school
 
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
district and the jaffrey rings school
district

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
and so i would offer to you that
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
those seven school districts
 
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.749 align:start position:0%
those seven school districts
are

00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
a body of interest
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
that could be worked with to
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
try to find how to
 
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.150 align:start position:0%
try to find how to
define

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
define
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
two senate districts
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
with those seven common uh taxing
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
districts represented in their school
 
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:16.069 align:start position:0%
districts represented in their school
therapies

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
to shift from the state senate and its
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
composition uh
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
i address next the executive council
 
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
i address next the executive council
district

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
cheshire county with its 76 plus
 
00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.830 align:start position:0%
cheshire county with its 76 plus
thousand

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.669 align:start position:0%
thousand
citizens

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
county 43 000
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
represent an area that i consider to be
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
western new hampshire
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
so representative smith representative
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
weber we share this interest in this
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
region with the state
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh that has
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
as we've noted uh through recent storms
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh common disasters uh common rivers
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh and common interest
 
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.630 align:start position:0%
uh and common interest
uh

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.630 align:start position:0%
uh
that

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
145 150 000 people will not make up an
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
executive council district but
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
stretching that executive council
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
district beyond rep
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
or interstate 93
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
is beyond the power of reasoning
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
ask that the
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
if your body
 
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.390 align:start position:0%
if your body
find

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
a way of defining a executive council
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
district that has
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
more geographic
 
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.029 align:start position:0%
more geographic
commonality

00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
commonality
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
than the
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
salamander district that district 2
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
currently represents going from the
 
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
currently represents going from the
vermont

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:52.390 align:start position:0%
and then
finally

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the house i think there are
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of complications uh trying to
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
divvy out 400
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
seats uh and
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
i what i i can
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
observe uh from those seats is that some
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
will represent 3 000
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
voters but some will represent 24 000
 
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
voters but some will represent 24 000
voters

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
some are
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
within the city and some
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
have a very large stretch of land and
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
even here in cheshire county
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
that make up
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
multiple towns and large geographic
 
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.430 align:start position:0%
multiple towns and large geographic
areas

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
i guess i
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
my biggest takeaway that i hope i leave
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
the need for some public feedback on
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
house districting
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
after your process i think is really
 
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
after your process i think is really
important

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
people need to see some transparency and
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
have some opportunity to comment on the
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations of your body relative to
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
house districts
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
and i hope you'll be able to incorporate
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.789 align:start position:0%
 
commentary

00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
commentary
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.270 align:start position:0%
at that time
so

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions but i'm
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the body looking for
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is ian burke i grew up
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
in the town of sullivan which is in
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
cheshire county uh and now i live in
 
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
cheshire county uh and now i live in
keynes

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm working with the open democracy now
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
tech team to better understand
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
the relationship between different
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
regional representative
 
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.789 align:start position:0%
regional representative
representation

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
maps and
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
other districts and communities that
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
exist in new hampshire
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think that representation works best
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
when our representatives can easily
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
connect with their constituents and also
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
when our representatives share
 
00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.149 align:start position:0%
when our representatives share
their

00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
constituents interests by using the same
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
blitz of water
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
shopping in the same stores
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the same weather disasters
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with the same property tax rates
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
i feel that redistricting for party and
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
electoral advantage
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
marginalizes actual communities in favor
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
of shared national party affiliation
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that that makes a
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
less effective legislation and less
 
00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:42.710 align:start position:0%
less effective legislation and less
effective

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
state government
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
i hope that
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
in future redistricting cycles new
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire can move to an independent
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
redescription process
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
but i hope that in the current cycle the
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
committees find maps that
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
put existing communities and their
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
shared interests
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
first above
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
political advantage thanks
 
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
6 26.
 
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.510 align:start position:0%
6 26.
that

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
was amazing so we don't have anyone else
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
and this is kind of deja vu because in
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
coast county
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
within the spinning distance of the
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
canadian border we ended at 6 26 and i
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
thought that was too quick
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to do the same thing in
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
case somebody's late and recess until 6
 
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.149 align:start position:0%
case somebody's late and recess until 6
40

00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
40
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
and at that time we'll see if anyone
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
else is ready to go and if not then
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.600 align:start position:0%

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
we're holding these input sessions in
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
all ten counties we hope to receive you
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
know local input from there
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
the stuff about range was great nuggets
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
like that things that we may not know
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
because we're not from there we will
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
take that back to concord we will
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
apply the map
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
to the maps because math is our god in
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
that case
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
in november this committee will vote on
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
a recommendation
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
it it'll be public sometime in january
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
or february house bills pass over the
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
senate there'll be more hearings so it
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't get all wrapped up right in
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
november there are many months more to
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh no um
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
getting to the senate page
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh you can do it from the senate website
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
but right at the general court website
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
there is a link on the right hand side
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
for both the house and the senate
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
web pages
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
remember these are going to be regular
 
00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:18.069 align:start position:0%
remember these are going to be regular
bills

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
and it will go through the normal bill
 
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
and it will go through the normal bill
process

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the committees so
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
time for you to come in
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh it may not be in the districts
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
but uh there will be time for you to
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.510 align:start position:0%
come in
alrighty

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
alrighty
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
and with that we have representative
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you for giving me a
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
chance to reconsider and actually
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
talking in front of the committee
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
welcome to cheshire county
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
i actually live in chesterfield so
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
although uh i'm probably a little biased
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure this is the best county in the
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
entire state
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
i represent cheshire district one which
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
is chesterfield
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh walpole hinsdale and westmoreland
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
some people might consider considering a
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of a larger district
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
because it's been my home now for almost
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
40 years
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
and as i've heard some people say it's
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
important for districts to share
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh some commonalities we are rural and
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
we definitely share the connecticut
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
river in fact we're sometimes called
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
four river towns so
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
and my constituents to keep us together
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
because we do have that big um that big
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
river that we share
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
between all the towns
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
um i've been a representative for six
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
years now um
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
i've had this opportunity but i'm
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
delighted to have that and in the six
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
years i've never heard any constituents
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
from any of those towns complain about
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
the way our cheshire district one is
 
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.710 align:start position:0%
the way our cheshire district one is
organized

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
organized
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
and surely
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
surely if there has been a problem
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
sometime in six years i would have
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
gotten an email that said representative
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
that i needed to think about this and
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not receiving that um
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
it works for us
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
here in cheshire district one because a
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
lot of our uh projects our projects
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
although they might be in one town or
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
they affect all of us for instance the
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
maplewood nursing home affects all of
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
the uh towns in cheshire district forum
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
the hinsdale bridge
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
was important to everybody
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
broadband in chesterfield was
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
a model for the broadband and welcome
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
these are not individual projects
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
they're district projects we are one
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
district cheshire one
 
00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.190 align:start position:0%
district cheshire one
um

00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
our constituents can easily travel
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
across and from all the way from
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
hinsdale to walpole
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
in fact i kind of doubtly even know that
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
they're you know going between uh
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
districts that oftentimes you heard when
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
and everything in between so
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
so they they do uh travel from one end
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
to the other very easily and
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a hardship it's not a problem
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
i've heard people tonight saying that
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
there are um some districts that have
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
problems and they need to be fixed and
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
i i get that there may be those nuggets
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
that the chair was referring to cheshire
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
district one is not wonderful it's not
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
broken it works well our constituents
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative birch
 
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:10.470 align:start position:0%
representative birch
westmoreland

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm paul burch from west milan also from
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
cheshire one
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
which i weren't speaking after my good
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
friend kathy harvey
 
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.030 align:start position:0%
friend kathy harvey
she

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
she
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
said pretty well what i wanted to say
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
and said it probably better than i can
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
the first speaker who spoke today
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
addressed one issue that was close to my
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
heart because he made reference to the
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
provision in the new hampshire
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
constitution and suggested that it was
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
not mandatory
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
that towns of a certain size have their
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
own representative and that is true and
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm glad someone else picked up on that
 
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.510 align:start position:0%
i'm glad someone else picked up on that
the

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supreme court dealt with
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
after the last reinforcement 10 years
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
ago and said there's a hierarchy
 
00:43:58.079 --> 00:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
ago and said there's a hierarchy
of

00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.550 align:start position:0%
of
values

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
values
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
in doing redistricting the top value is
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
the federal which is one person one vote
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
below that are the
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitutional values
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
which include
 
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.030 align:start position:0%
which include
the

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
towns should get
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
within a proper deviation
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh representation by
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
size but also such concepts it's not
 
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.670 align:start position:0%
size but also such concepts it's not
dividing

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
dividing
 
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.710 align:start position:0%
dividing
uh

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
towns into different districts paying
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
attention to uh natural formations such
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
as mountains and rivers and alike
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of factors that go
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
into uh redistricting and i'm sure that
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
this committee is more than familiar
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
with uh with those um i have to second
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
what uh representative barbara said
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
about how well things work in uh gesture
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
one and that goes to the other issue and
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
that is commonality of interests that is
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
not in the constitution statutory and
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
therefore it doesn't quite have the same
 
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.309 align:start position:0%
therefore it doesn't quite have the same
protection

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:07.990 align:start position:0%
protection
as

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
the constitutional provisions
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
but i don't know a single granite stater
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't appreciate commonality of
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
interests when they get together to
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
decide how money should be spent how
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
projects should be approved or not
 
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.470 align:start position:0%
projects should be approved or not
approved

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and how
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
issues that affect them and their
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
families should be built
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
commonality interest is so important and
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
i remember when redistricting happened
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
10 years ago i wasn't in the legislature
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
that but i tend to meet it similar to
 
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
that but i tend to meet it similar to
this

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of discussion about
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
how to fashion
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
the districts and i have to say even
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
before i was in the legislature
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
that putting the four river towns
 
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.069 align:start position:0%
that putting the four river towns
together

00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
by far
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
made the most sense
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
for this neck of the woods
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
because the ecology and the economics
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
of the connecticut river
 
00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:07.430 align:start position:0%
of the connecticut river
are

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.790 align:start position:0%
are
so

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.069 align:start position:0%
so
important

00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
and they are so linked
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the well-being of the people who live
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the river
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
so whether it's
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
waste in the river
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
commerce and the river
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's transportation and the
 
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.750 align:start position:0%
whether it's transportation and the
river

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
river
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
it makes a big deal to those who live
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
on the river
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not just that i can
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
sit on my back porch and look across the
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
river and see bernie sanders for vermont
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's that we go back and forth and
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
people who live
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
on one side of the river
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
work at walmart and instead and things
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
so yes it does work
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i guess the final comment i want to
 
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.109 align:start position:0%
and i guess the final comment i want to
say

00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
is the echo what kathy harvey said is
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
most granite staters believe if it ain't
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
broke don't fix
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
but if it is broken
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
and it is broken in parts and anybody
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
who looks at the executive council
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
seat for district 2
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh knows it's broken
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
and fix the broken parts
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
but don't try to
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
try to fix the unbroken parts uh just
 
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.190 align:start position:0%
try to fix the unbroken parts uh just
because

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
you got a chance to do it
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
so you've heard from two of the four
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
people in in the county
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the district and i will echo in my
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
ten years of the legislature
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
i have yet to have a single
