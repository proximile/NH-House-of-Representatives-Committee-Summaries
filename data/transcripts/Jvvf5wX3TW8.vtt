service and I call on the prime sponsor
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
of this legislation representative JD

Falls Kensington Southampton Newton and
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
plastow um so
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
I I I'm
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh opening this discussion on HB
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
1617 uh which is an act relative to
 
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
1617 uh which is an act relative to
energy

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
procurement uh agreements for default
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
service and what this bill does is ADD
 
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 align:start position:0%
reasonable price stability is one of the
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
criteria for default service the others
 
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
being provide a safety net assure
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
Universal act access and system
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
integrity and what it focuses on is
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
Energy service
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
contracts uh that the power or the power
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
supply agreements uh that the utilities
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
enter into by requiring them to consider
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
varying length and terms of contracts
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
potentially lading those and having them
 
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the Pu on a quarterly basis
 
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
contracts being shortterm meaning 3 to
 
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
six months medium-term 6 to 12 months or
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
long-term 12 to 18 months in duration
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
but no specificity of how many have to
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
be in what uh of what flavor it's it's
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's basically their assessment of
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
what will get to reasonable price
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
stability now this bill is really a
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
placeholder bill it's it arose after a
 
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919 align:start position:0%
working session uh of late last year
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
um in that working session we indicated
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
we were awaiting the Doe's report on
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
this subject matter that report is not
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
yet issued it's still a placeholder uh
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
but they are here to testify on options
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
to make it better
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
um I want serious input uh from the doe
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
the Pu the utilities from rate payers
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
and other interested parties to improve
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and make it the best possible
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
um the desire here is really to remove
 
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
that 30 30 plus perc risk premium that's
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
associated with current uh contracts
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
largely the natural gas
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
contracts uh to clo to get our rates
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
closer to Market rates which should
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
provide greater
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
stability ideally it would have blunted
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
that huge doubling Spike we saw in July
 
00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.710 align:start position:0%
that huge doubling Spike we saw in July
of

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
2020 um
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
if the utilities were looking at rates
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
on a quarterly basis at a minimum and
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to take some of that
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
risk uh premium out of their their
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
contracts so again I'm looking for
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
further ideas to improve this bill to
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
make it a better bill so that we can in
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
a working session uh come up with an
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
amendment so uh for advancing this bill
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and with that I'm open for any
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh but I'm really looking for
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
those that follow me to give their
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
ideas okay thank you representative
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
Bernardi for introducing that bill as
 
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi said
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
he introduces this bill
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can begin a good conversation
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
about the subject and we have the Public
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission we have the New
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy we have
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
eversource and we have the office of the
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate all scheduled to
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
testify here so I humbly suggest that we
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
try to restrict our questions to
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi so that we can
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
have maximum time to get input from
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
these other uh entities but with that I
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
will recognize representative Doug
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a question thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so to
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
be clear on the bill being a
 
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
placeholder uh is it an attempt um to
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
allow the utilities to become more
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
flexible in perhaps grabbing an
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
advantageous market price when they see
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
it coming versus being restricted to a
 
00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:30.519 align:start position:0%
time element that that makes them to be
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
locked into a price that they would
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
otherwise would like to be
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
lower yes that's exactly the focus uh
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
right now contracts are let every six
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
months in a very short time window and
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the market price and the risk
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
premium associated with that is is what
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
they are stuck with and what we're stuck
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
with if if we allow for greater
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility in that Contracting schedule
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh ideally we'll take uh some of that
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
system representative reyolds has a
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
noting your the section where you the
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
last section that's bolded where you say
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
um permitting a mix of short medium and
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts and in parenthesis
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
you say the duration so longterm 12 to
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
18 months do you mean who say that the
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
longest term contract you
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
envision uh utilities entering into is
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
18 months or is that are you open to is
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that intended to be sort of binding as
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
the longest term contract allowed or was
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
that just example no it's not intended
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
to be the longest longest term I like
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm I'm open for uh for
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
improvements to this and if uh
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
if some utility identifies a source
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's five years of you know two cents
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
a kilowatt hour jump on it thank you I'm
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
that okay seeing no other questions for
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi I'd like to next
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
call on Alex spidel from the Public
 
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.829 align:start position:0%
call on Alex spidel from the Public

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
Commission good morning Mr spel and
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
again good morning Mr chair thank
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
you I have some prepared remarks that
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to read from first if
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
possible certainly thank you thank you
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to address the
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
committee with some thoughts regarding
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
this bill from the commission's
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
perspective I'm Alexander spidel a
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
senior adviser at the New Hampshire
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission I first
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
became associated with the Commission in
 
00:13:57.959 --> 00:13:59.910 align:start position:0%
became associated with the Commission in
2010

00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
2010
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
the commission believes that this bill
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
while well intentioned in light of
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
recent events in the energy markets
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
would cause more harm than good for New
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rap
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
payers as a matter of principle it is
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
better for the legislature to leave some
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
matters open-ended for the commission to
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
determine as time goes on based on the
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
facts and circumstances at hand through
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
our judicative
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
processes this is such an area as time
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
has gone on the wholesale energy markets
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
New England have matured and are
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
starting to bear fruit for
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
consumers in recent weeks the commission
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
has approved significant decreases for
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
default service also called Energy
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%

investor-owned Electric
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
utilities the overall Bill reductions to
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
be effective on February the 1st range
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
from about 10% to the high teens and the
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
reduction in the the energy component
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
alone ranges from 25% to
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
33% these are major savings which will
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
apply for the upcoming February through
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
July 6th month rate
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
cycle these savings are also on top of
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
the last rate Cycles reductions which
 
00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759 align:start position:0%
applied from August of last year through
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
the end of this month of
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
January the reason that New Hampshire
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
default service customers are enjoying
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
these savings is because new Hampshire's
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
default Service rates are Market
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
reflective in that they adjust every 6
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
months in response to the prices offered
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
by wholesale Market suppliers for their
 
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.389 align:start position:0%
by wholesale Market suppliers for their
supply

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
supply
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
contracts there is no lading or staging
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
of these contracts out of time so
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
consumers pay prices that roughly
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
correspond to the prevailing energy
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
market conditions in New
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
England now after the energy Market
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
Panic of early 2022 has subsided New
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rape payers taking Energy
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
service from their utilities are able to
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
enjoy the downward swing in prices
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
without undue delay or what economists
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
term price
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
stickiness commissioner Elms of the
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
Department of energy will give more
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
details about how this Dynamic has given
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for New Hampshire than
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
for our Southern New England neighbors
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
like Massachusetts which do apply the
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
lattering concept
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
the commission after its i22 d53
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
investigation is currently exploring
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
having more direct access to the
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity markets by New
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire utilities and providing
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
default service which could offer even
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
more potential for savings by reducing
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
transaction costs and having even more
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
Market reflective prices while
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
maintaining the stability of having a
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
six-month rate cycle for households and
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
our investigation data does indicate
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
that true wholesale prices in New
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
England are much lower than prices
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
offered through wholesale requirements
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
contracts a correlation that has held
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
true over the last several
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
years the imposition of lading and other
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
such prescribed approaches would
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
severely blunt the commission's ability
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
to assess and potentially direct
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
implementation of improvements to
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
default service procur M approaches
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
going forward and potentially hamstering
 
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
the ability of New Hampshire consumers
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
to fully benefit from Market reflective
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
pricing Dynamics in the
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
future I thank the committee for your
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
consideration of these remarks and I
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
welcome questions from members of the
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions from the
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington has
 
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.230 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington has
a

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
you uh for taking my question nice to
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
see you again
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
um my question is this I I believe and
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm wrong that the commission
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
already has the authority to set various
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
lengths of times for contracts if they
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
deemed that that was appropriate and
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
with that flexibility they could change
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
how the contract's lengths were going to
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
be much quicker than having to go
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
through a legislative process to do that
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
so you could more accurately reflect
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
what was going on in the market is that
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
correct uh in a general uh term Mr
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
representative yes I would say that if a
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
regulated utility wanted to adjust its
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
contract lengths or the length of its
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
procurement cycle it could make a
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
proposal to that effect to the
 
00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
commission and the commission would
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
assess that in an adjudication and
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
that's currently existing within our
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
framework to have the capability to
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
adjust those settlement agreements and
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
adjust those approaches right now thank
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
you representative Thomas has a question
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
dou Thomas that is thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying and under
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
good times of stability in the world uh
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
it probably works best but in this world
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
things are not going well and they and
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
they not go well quickly there
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
are faster things happening and response
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
times are are severely shortened what
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
there what then could you
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
recommend like the process you just uh
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned would take time I assume to
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know redo the contract and so forth
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
and and by that time the the um ability
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
to grab a a a a good price might go away
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
my concern um overall is the bad effects
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
it has on our residents when you have a
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
huge price spike that they haven't
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
planned for most people have budgets and
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
even though they might pay a slightly
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
higher price if it's the same all the
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
way all the way through they can adjust
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay but when it spikes badly that's
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
when you know you get complaints they
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
get hurt so what do you recommend then
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we could do to avoid those High
 
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
spice prices that are going to happen
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
again because the world is changing
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
quickly up and down it's not going to go
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
back um Mr representative I would say a
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
few things u i will allow commissioner
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
Elms to expand on a little bit of what
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
happened in Massachusetts but the data
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
shows that they eventually did get the
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
2022 price spike reflected in their
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
rates it was a little bit of a time
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
delay perhaps due to lading but they
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
ended up higher up than New Hampshire
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
ended up and the delayed reaction has
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
taken longer time to correct itself down
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
to the lower pricing level so
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
202022 uh those two years were very
 
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
unusual with the pandemic obviously the
 
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.350 align:start position:0%
unusual with the pandemic obviously the
industrial

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
industrial
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
shutdowns prices in the energy markets
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
crashed and then they corrected there
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
was inflation there was the war in
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
Ukraine that resulted in a lot of
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about supply for Western Europe
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
for East Asia and the Market's
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
overcorrected a little bit but things
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
have stabilized there seems to be uh I
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
would say the market has responded
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
around the world to the Natural Gas
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
markets and the energy markets generally
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
have responded to the understanding that
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
we can have alternative Supply sources
 
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.029 align:start position:0%
we can have alternative Supply sources
from

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
Russia and to have Market reflective
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
prices is important because it if there
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
is real scarcity for example if there
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
were time situation and there was real
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
scarcity of energy it's important to
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
send that signal to Consumers to respond
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately if there's true scarcity
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
so there's a variety of reasons that
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
complete amelioration of price spikes is
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
not always the right answer and it's
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
better to allow things to adjust
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
naturally on their own in a reasonable
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
help representative Gman has a question
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
spidel for taking my
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
question as is with each of the three
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
investor owned utilities going out for
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
contracts every six months what we have
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
then is six rate cases per year coming
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
before the Pu with lading it could be
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
many more is that a concern of the Pu is
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
just the increased workload on looking
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
at these rate
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
cases um I I don't understand uh
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily the lattering proposal to
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
implicate more frequent default service
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments Mr representative I think
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
what would be implicated is uh from our
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
point of view a concern that it would
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
result in bad outcomes for consumers
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
where you would be locked into high
 
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.230 align:start position:0%
where you would be locked into high
pricing

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
structures and you would not have a
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
natural adjustment every six months to
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
reflect lower prices and so 6 months may
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
seem like a long time but it's actually
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
a fairly short time into the energy
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
markets on a macro level and when you
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
have requirements contracts being
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
resubmitted on a six-month cycle the
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
market participants are quite Nimble in
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
adjusting to what's going on out in the
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
world it is true that there is a concern
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
regarding risk premium uh that is a
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
different matter of discussion but the
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
lattering issue has nothing to do with
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
sir representative right else has a
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman because
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
my my question is a follow on to to my
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
colleague representative corman's
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
question even if
 
00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
um you said that you don't
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
um his question was basically about the
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
the workload for the Pu and you you said
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
you didn't see that this would involve
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
more frequent rate cases but the the
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
plain language of of the bills it seems
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
to put a trem
 
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous additional workload on the on
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
the commission it's and and and even it
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to put the Commission in the
 
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.510 align:start position:0%
it seems to put the Commission in the
role

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
role
 
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
of you know taking responsibility for
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
for Price stability it says you'll
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
review contracts on a quarterly basis
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
and permit a mix of short medium and
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
long contracts that sounds like just
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a lot of analytical work uh and
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
I know you you testified the Pu is
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill so I I guess I just
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about the the workload
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
component you may be right about that
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
sir in that maybe we kind of have a can
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
do attitude we're a pretty small agency
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
and we're pretty flat and so we we often
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh take on projects and we don't have
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
the mindset of fretting about workload
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
but I think if two representatives are
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
asking about that question I on some
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
reflection I think you may have a very
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
good point there both of you um it may
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
be if it were to come into fruition it
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
would require more work than I had Ed
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
participated so that that's worth the
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
thought yes thank you representative Ms
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you thank you Mr
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
question U I want to Echo the concerns
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
of uh representative Doug Thomas um but
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of businesses in
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
the state um
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that businesses um
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
look for is some predictability in terms
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
of what their costs are going to be
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
going forward and um the current
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
system creates some pretty significant
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
uncertainty uh with with you know
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
significant spikes upwards and downwards
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
and it makes it very hard to plan out
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
Investments um the the bill is an
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
attempt I think to give the
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
Pu kind of another tool in the in the in
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
your toolbox to try try to um address
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that concern um given your opposition to
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
the bill are there other tools that we
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
should be considering to uh provide some
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
more predictability in the
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
rates I would answer that uh one of the
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
issues that the commission sees with the
 
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
bill is that it restricts the number of
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
tools in the toolbox that are accessible
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
to the commission that it restricts the
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
discretion of the commission to consider
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
remedies that are appropriate so to
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
backfill on your question regarding
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
business energy use the larger the
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire the more
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
likely it is that they have electrical
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
supply the energy component provided
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
through competitive Supply contracts
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
that they negotiate on their own through
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
competitive wholesale energy suppliers
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at manufacturing
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
concerns even medium-sized businesses
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
like shopping centers and the like they
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
tend to have those thirdparty contracts
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
are not involved in default service so
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't really touch upon them for
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
the smallest business that find default
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
service to be relatively convenient
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
their load profile it can it can be
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
varying of course but if you're thinking
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
about a small business such as a
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant or a small store it it the
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
the spikes are of concern but they do
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
reflect market conditions and one of the
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
reasons that the legislature directed
 
00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:26.919 align:start position:0%
the commission about 10 years ago to
 
00:27:26.919 --> 00:27:28.190 align:start position:0%
the commission about 10 years ago to
finalize

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
finalize
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
the divesture process wherein we would
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
be getting energy Supply not directly
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
from the power plants of the three
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
utilities but rather uh the competitive
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
market is that sending the pricing
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
signals is good to encourage efficiency
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
but also to enable the consumer to pay
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
what's out in the market and not an
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
artificially low or high price and
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
so I would say that this bill is
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
problematic because it restricts the
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
discretion of the commission and also
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
that it it's not necessarily a bad thing
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
for folks on default service to see some
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
adjustments to price to reflect what's
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
actually going on in the real world
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
based on natural gas prices based on
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
other conditions it's uh Market signals
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
can provide many benefits to individuals
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
followup followup
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
um you you've said you know several
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
occasions that this bill kind of limits
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
the commission's ability to to take
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
action I I'm not sure I understand that
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
I mean the I don't know that the bill at
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
least the way I read it and maybe you
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
can point out to me where I'm
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
wrong I don't think there's anything in
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
the bill that forces the commission to
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
only consider lattering op lattering
 
00:28:56.919 --> 00:28:58.029 align:start position:0%
only consider lattering op lattering
situations

00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
what it does is
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
enables um
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
lading so so what what am I what am I
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
missing and maybe I'm reading the bill
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
wrong I would say uh as a point of
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
interest uh on line six of the version
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill I have here before me it
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
says in order to provide price stability
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
so um price
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
stability is in the mix for the various
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
restructure policy principles that the
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
legislature enacted first off uh nearly
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
25 years ago but then reemphasized about
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
10 years ago with the PSNH
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
divestiture and it's it's a it's a
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
phrase that has a specific meaning in
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
the economic world that says stability
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be your prime directive
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
versus Market reflective prices and then
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say the commission shall
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
oversee the timing in terms of energy
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
service contracts between the regulated
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
public utilities and energy
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
providers and shall approve such
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
procurement dot dot dot using various
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
lengths and terms and lading so when you
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire traditional
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
statutory construction when we at the
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies read the
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
legislative enactments when we see shall
 
00:30:20.909 --> 00:30:20.919 align:start position:0%
and then conjunctive phrases with and we
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
requirement okay representative Kennedy
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um this is
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a followup to the
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
previous question when I read the bill
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
it it sounds to me like any plan for
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
lading or whatever would originate with
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
the utilities and you know it would be
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
your job to you know oversee that or
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
approve it or whatever so I mean you you
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be coming up with lattering
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
schemes that would be for them although
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why they would care too
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
much to lower their cost but anyway well
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's open to interpretation uh the
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
commission shall
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
oversee uh I would say oversight can
 
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
implicate different elements but more to
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
your point the utilities themselves
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
during our recent
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
investigation uh most of them I think
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
all of them actually the investor owned
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
ones were not very enthusiastic about
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
Ling's outcomes um some like ever Source
 
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that they had been involved
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
in lading in Southern New Eng with mixed
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
or less than ideal results and so their
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
message uh to the commission was we're
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
not really excited about lading on our
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
own so it would be a tension where you
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
have the legislature putting their chips
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
on the bumper for lading but the
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
utilities themselves have expressed um
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
mixed feelings about it at least to the
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
commission and also the commission would
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
want to be responsive to what the
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislature wants them to do as we
 
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.389 align:start position:0%
legislature wants them to do as we
always

00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
are okay I'd remind the members that we
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
have several other learned people who
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
would like to testify this morning
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has another
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh so Mr
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
spidel I'm beginning to understand your
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
concerns here and I'm wondering if there
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable way to address them um
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
as is right now it says the commission
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
shall review contracts on a quarterly
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
basis and permitting a mix of short 3 to
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
six months duration medium six to 12
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
month duration and long-term 12 to 18mth
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
duration so the current six-month
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
contracts actually are part could be
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
part of that mix six months um it seems
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that instead of shall in some cases in
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
some places in the text um we could have
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
May so that the utilities May ladder and
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
the Pu would oversee that but that uh
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
that the lading would not be required
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
would that address some of your
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
concerns I would want to confir with my
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
colleagues more fully about whatever
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
final form the language would take under
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
such a um approach Mr representative but
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
I would offer this that uh in general
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
terms it's from the commission's
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
perspective we have a lot of
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
broad-ranging authority and we have a
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
lot of folks before us the utilities the
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer Advocate the
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy other interested
 
00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:27.710 align:start position:0%
department of energy other interested
parties

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
that come before us and are able to
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
engage in our judicative processes to
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
come up with solutions that make sense
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
over time and even if it's softened to a
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
I would say uh optional or semi-
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
optional form what what that would do is
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
again it it tends to um nudge things in
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
a specific direction that the
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
legislature might not necessarily intend
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
or might not necessarily appreciate as
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
time goes on because it may come up with
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
bad um outcomes versus the commission
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
being flexible and within its General
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority um coming up with
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
Solutions together with the other
 
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
parties to make sure that we're Nimble
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
and we we can reflect what's going on on
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
the ground in real time so um I from a
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
personal perspective I've testified
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
before the legislature a couple of times
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
before over the years and I I tend to
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
shy away from specific language
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations I think maybe
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elms would be better at
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
that but in a general sense um we we
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
want to be able to have an open field of
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
play the way it it's currently exists
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
possible representative Kaplan has a
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.230 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
you

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um for taking my question um you you've
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that lattering has led to bad
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes in in Southern New England and
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
other places that they used it and uh I
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
just wondered if you you uh I wondered
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
if you could be more specific about what
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
those bad outcomes entail and I and I
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
suppose the follow-up question is do you
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
not agree that price stability would be
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
a one of the priorities of the
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
commission along with the reflecting
 
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.310 align:start position:0%
commission along with the reflecting
Market

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
Market
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
forces okay so in the
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
future yeah okay I'll repeat that
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
question I I did I did understand the
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative but please go ahead
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
basically I just wanted could you be
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
more specific of what those bad bad
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
outcomes entail using lading in other
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
places and whether or not price
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
stability is indeed a priority for the
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
commission or not so the commission has
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
a series of directives laid out by the
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
legislature in the what are known as the
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
restructuring policy um I would the
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
restructuring policy principles and also
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
there is an overall requirement under
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
our statutes under chapters 374 and 378
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
for just and reasonable rates and
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
there's a whole series of elements that
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
feed into that price stability is one of
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
the elements that's in the mix it's not
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
the only element and the reason the
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
commission has abided by the general
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
framework um of Market reflective
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
pricing is because over time yes there
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
are reversals there are price spikes and
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
once in a blue moon you may see
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
something like a price crash such as
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic year of 2020
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking over time when
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
you pull back the camera you see that
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
the markets generate generally stable
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
generally favorable pricing outcomes for
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
consumers so uh price controls have
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
effects in economics when you look at
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
either micro or
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
macroeconomics price controls are
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned and they often have a
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
sense of this looks good this could help
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
out the consumer but it it it it often
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
happens that instead of allowing the
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
market dynamics to play out within
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines of course when you establish
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
price controls through lading or some
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
other means you tend to force up the
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
spikes farther than you would have had
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
you allowed the natural flow of the
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
contract terms to take place and the
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in prices that you would
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
expect after the reversal of a price
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
bike take longer so that's what the data
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
show in Massachusetts for instance
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we've actually looked at the prices
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years in
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts their eventual Spike was
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
delayed slightly by one cycle but their
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
prices ended up going higher than the
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire energy component prices
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
and the reversal has taken longer to to
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
work through so um price controls have
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
generally a fairly bad track record in
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
economics um there are wartime
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
situations like World War II where they
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
were imposed but they were often um
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
ignored or shunted around and there was
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
a black market of course we don't have
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
that here but they they often end up
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
having counterintuitive or or the
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
opposite of result of what you intend
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
control

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
um they have a logistical problem to
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
consider I've received about 15 pink
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
cards testimony on the next
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill we're well into this uh public
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and we still have three
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
learned persons to hear from so I'm
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if I could encourage the
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee to move on and suspend
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions of this uh individual for the
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
time being would that be po possible all
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
right I want to thank you Mr spidel your
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
information has been extremely valuable
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate you being here but in
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
the interest of keeping things moving
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
along I'd like to call Chris Elms from
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy to speak with
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
us next thank you Mr chairman and the
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you thank
 
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:15.109 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you thank
you

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
Alex good morning Mr assistant
 
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner and Mr
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
France thank you Mr chairman and members
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh for the record my
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
name is Chris Elms I'm the Deputy
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the Hampshire Department
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
of energy and I'm joined by Tom France
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
who is our regulatory director um in the
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
interest of speeding up my testimony I
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
will say that I share a lot of the uh uh
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
concerns that Alex raised we are opposed
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh as written uh we view
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
the bill as unnecessarily unnecessary
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
overly prescriptive and inflexible uh
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
should negative rap hair outcomes arise
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
um I'll skip through some of the
 
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
background on it because Alex did a good
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
job of laying that out um I did want to
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
talk talk a little bit about um you know
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
sort of lading as a strategy or as a
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
mandate we are not necessarily opposed
 
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
to Greater you know lading you know
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that we are looking at
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
in an investigation that we opened
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
earlier well earlier last year uh and uh
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of reviewing we
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
will issue a comprehensive Report with
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations and information on a
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
number of topics related to the
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
procurement of default service um but I
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
do want to talk about lading and some of
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
the issues but why it might not be the
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
clear answer and I think Alex did a good
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
job of laying them out but frankly
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
lading uh most simply put tends to be
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
more expensive for for customers now
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
there are potential benefits in terms of
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
price stability but when you look at uh
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
the longer contracts that are going to
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
be entered into as a result of
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
lading um there are going to be greater
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
Market risks on those contracts and
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
consequ quently uh suppliers are either
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
going to be less likely to participate
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
meaning less competition and less
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
obvious less competition means more uh
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
price for customers or uh they will bid
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
in a higher risk premium on their bids
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
which will then be passed on to
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
customers you know the the the thought
 
00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
is that if you ladder uh your prices are
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to be uh increasing more uh slowly
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
but you know once the prices go down
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to go down uh more slowly I did
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
share with you a chart uh that compares
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
energy Supply rates paid by eversource
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts customers and eversource
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residential customers uh
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
from January 2021 to July
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
2024 um as you can see uh you know from
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
that chart again this is just the energy
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
Supply rate so it's not the all-in rate
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire in in uh July of or
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
August of 2022 saw that that bigger
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
Spike uh but when you look at the those
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
42 months in 36 of them New Hampshire
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
had lower Supply rates than
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh only in six and those
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
six uh you can see uh were we hire um
 
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
that I think does illustrate some of
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here that the
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
risk premiums associated with longer
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
contracts in a lattering situation are
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to uh just lead to higher costs so
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
you know representative Bernardi I know
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
raised you know the question of of
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should look at uh
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
adjustments to this structure um you
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
know and and that question of price
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
stability versus Market reflective
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
pricing is an important one for you to
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
consider I will uh just kind of throw
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
some some other information out that
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
that was uh touched on but I I wanted to
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
reemphasize uh there are currently
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
alternatives for customers who do value
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
price stability more than the current
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
default Service uh structure uh calls
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
for competitive Supply is an option
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
consumers today can go onto our website
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
go to our comparison shopping page for
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh competitive Supply and and find uh
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
rates that go anywhere from six months
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
to two years um you'll you'll be able to
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
see the different prices that go in
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's different terms and conditions
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know we do encourage consumers to uh
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
you know do their do their research
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
before entering into any of those things
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
but there are options for folks who who
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh prefer stability likewise Community
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
power uh represents an opportunity for
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
towns who's who want to say that if if
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
my uh citizens in my town want to you
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
know emphasize a whole bunch of
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
different um you know values or or
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
whatever be it stability price uh
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
environmental considerations that's an
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
option for for towns to look into under
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
the current structure we don't need uh
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
any statutory changes to have additional
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
lading um as a matter of fact uh until
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
2012 uh Unitil uh in New Hampshire used
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
lading as a as a strategy they uh came
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the commission and asked to move away
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
from it because the wholesale risk
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
premiums associated with lading were too
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
um too expensive for customers and I and
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
I will say you know I know we all heard
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
a lot uh in the public when that first
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
Spike happened in in in August of 2022
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh from consumers and from um you know
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
folks who were concerned about how
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
prices went up I I'll just say that when
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
the reason that you know Unitil uh came
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
back and and undid sort of what they had
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
with lading was because citizens uh
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
constituents would see hey why are our
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
prices so much higher than they are uh
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
in neighboring utilities or uh in other
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
states and the answer was well they they
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
lad and these um prices are sticky and
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're continuing on so I I'll
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
just say you know you trade one problem
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
for another and and you know what we see
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
is that under the current structure
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
there's flexibility for the commission
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
and for stakeholders like the department
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
of energy the OCA the utilities other
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to weigh in on on that
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
process and it's a it's a good one um I
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
also would like to just point out on
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
that front that um beyond the language
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill State Statute under RSA 374
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
F3 Roman 5 subsection e authorizes the
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
commission to quote approve alternative
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
means of providing default service which
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
are designed to minimize cons customer
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
risk not unduly harm the development of
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
competitive markets and mitigate against
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
price volatility without creating new
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
deferred costs provided that the
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
commission finds that such means are in
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
interest so again um just to sort of
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
wrap it up there is a reason that this
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislature uh and its wisdom and and
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
just about every legislature in the
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
country has created a pu or a Public
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
Service Commission or a dpu um and and
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's because ratemaking is a complex
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
process it's timeconsuming it's
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
iterative iterative and it involves a
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
lot of collaboration and expert uh work
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
um it it might not be wise for the
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to step into the process uh
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
on this right now we have an existing
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
process that has multiple ongoing
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
reviews from the commission from the
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um with the
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find changes and there
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
are currently available alternatives for
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
customers who want to value price
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
stability more than say um the the
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
current situation would would call for
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
um obviously legislation is going to be
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
much more inflexible and less likely for
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
us to be able to Pivot away from
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
negative rapair outcome should we arise
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
um happy to take
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much I
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
have a question for you you mentioned
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony that the doe
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
has an ongoing investigation into this
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
question yep could you share with us in
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
any of your findings um particularly
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
strategies that might work to mitigate
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
the problems that we saw in uh July of
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
2022 I'm going to let Tom answer a
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more of the specifics but
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
again you know our Our intention here is
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
to give a real comprehensive look at the
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
history for both the legislature for the
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
commission for other stakeholders uh and
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
to provide you know some recommendations
 
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
and just to highlight some of the
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
challenges we see with a variety of
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes we we uh hired exitor Associates to
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
help on this investigation they have a
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
lot of expertise not just in New England
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
but across the country um they've they
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
looked at the pu's investigation they
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed that information carefully uh
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
they interviewed utilities and others uh
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
concerning their strategies they asked
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions about Alternatives including
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
even to sending clock auctions with some
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
experts in the country that do that and
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
in a couple states such as uh
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and Ohio we have uh a
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive draft that we've been uh
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
reviewing and I think we're close to
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
releasing that and we're happy to with
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
exer to come in and actually go through
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that report in detail with this
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh but at this point I think
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's probably just slightly still
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
premature to give any final
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations on that you have an
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
approximate date when um that study
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
completed weeks not
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
months okay thank you other questions
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
doe well seeing none I guess you guys

presentation I have a pink card here
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
from Michael Lata of ERS Source although
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
I not not sure I see him in the oh there
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
he is hiding in the back okay Mr Lata
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
regular seat you're
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
up nice job of hiding back

eversource
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
um eversource is is new control on the
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
bill um as has been
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
discussed uh you know we are certainly
 
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
not opposed to to lading as a uh
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
strategy to provide um additional
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
stability in customers energy Supply
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
rates uh previous uh testifiers had
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is a strategy that
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
um uh we do use which is uh directed by
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
state law in Massachusetts and
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um so I would suggest that
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
if it is the um legislator's intention
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh to move forward with that we we can
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
certainly accommodate and adjust our
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
procurement strategies to uh to
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
incorporate lading uh here in New
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I would suggest um and
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
just as a refresher I believe the
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
committee knows but um every six months
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
we do go out and we procure 100% of the
 
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.430 align:start position:0%
we do go out and we procure 100% of the
customers

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.950 align:start position:0%
customers
needs

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
on default Service uh those rates change
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
every February and August uh we file um
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
really the procurement uh RFP with the
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
commission they make sure that we
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
properly executed that RFP that we're
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
prudently selecting the the lowest cost
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh supplier that responded to the RFP
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
and that is what goes into uh into
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
customer rates again those who elect to
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
stay on default Service uh this is a
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
direct pass through so the utility does
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
not make any money whatever we um uh get
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
from the market from suppliers is what
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
what customers pay for that service um
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
so the I think there are sort of two
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
notable changes uh in the
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the first is a change in
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
sort of the focus and purpose of default
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
Service as representative Bernardi
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
touched upon uh the addition of
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable price stability uh would
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
change um sort of the the focus and and
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
um uh really the purpose of default
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
service right now it is supposed to be
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh as closely reflective to the market
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
as possible uh so again that's that is a
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
a notable change and I know Mr spidel
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
and um uh Deputy Commissioner chin
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
touched Elms uh touched upon how how
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
that would be uh impactful um the second
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
piece which is is directing the
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
commission to oversee the timing in
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
terms of energy service contracts uh
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
again if it's the uh wish of the
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature to move forward with sort of
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
price stability and lading um we we'd
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
suggest a little bit of a different
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
approach uh we'd suggest that the
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislature uh direct the
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
utilities um or to make it clear that
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
utilities have the authority to propose
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
uh lading contracts so not necessarily a
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
mandate or requirement but making it
 
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
clear uh that that is something that the
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
utilities can do subject to a manner
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
that is uh approved by the commission uh
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
I do have some uh Amendment texts that
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
i' be happy to share with the committee
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh but the approach that we're
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting is uh more enabling and
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
provides a bit more flexibility for the
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
commission excuse me for the utilities
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
to propose um uh procurement strategies
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
for commission approval that of course
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
other interveners the consumer Advocate
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy would have a
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
role in in reviewing and um uh providing
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
comment on uh so with that um and I
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
think that also uh just one final
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
thought I I know uh representative
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
Kennedy had sort of touched on you know
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
the utilities providing the proposals
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
versus the commission overseeing and I
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
think that's a little bit more in
 
00:53:22.109 --> 00:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
keeping with with that approach uh and
 
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd be happy to answer
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
have okay thank you questions from the

copy of your suggested amendments so
thank

00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
for being here and for taking our
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh you testified that um by
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
state law eversource does lattering in
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut has there
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
been um have you seen a
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
beneficial reaction to this for the rate
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
payers yeah I I I think um the previous
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
testifiers uh sort of touched on I I'll
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
say the benefits of of lading as well as
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
some of the um uh challenges when the
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
the market prices are rising it's
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
helpful you'll you'll stay lower longer
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
because you have uh contracts that are
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
spread out so customers will not see
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
those um impacts as soon however in a
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
falling Market um you do uh stay higher
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
longer so just you know for example um I
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
just pulled up up these numbers uh
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
quickly uh so in Connecticut uh the the
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
rate is subject to change um or or did
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
14.71% uh in
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh it's just changed to
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
17.25 it was at
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
16.08 and previously
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
25.7 so again lading in and of itself
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
does not result in lower rates but sort
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
of Smooths out the the Peaks and
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
valleys followup yes thank you
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
um from ever source's point of view if
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
some of the states are doing lading
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
right now wouldn't it be easier if all
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
of the states did
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
lading uh no not necessarily as long as
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
we have clear Direction on how to do the
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
procurements in each state uh it's it's
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
something that we do and can
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
accommodate representative muns has a
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
you uh for for
 
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.910 align:start position:0%
you uh for for
testifying

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
um so um it it we heard previously that
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
um utilities have broad discretion on
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
what they can propose and the Pu has
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
broad discretion on what they can they
 
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.230 align:start position:0%
broad discretion on what they can they
can

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
approve but it sounds like from the from
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
your perspective
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
that that discretion doesn't currently
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
exist is that correct so
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
um as was previously stated utilities
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
there there is no state law that
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
prohibits utilities from from doing
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
lading U again Unitil was doing up until
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
fairly recently um we have commission
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
order that directs Us in the manner in
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
which we do the procurements the six
 
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.789 align:start position:0%
which we do the procurements the six
months

00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
100% um that was approved coming out of
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh electric restructuring and the
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
divesture of Our Generation assets so
 
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
once we sold off the generation that had
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
been providing a portion of default
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
Service uh the commission there was a a
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
proceeding and the commission you know
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
ordered us this is how you shall do it
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
now again that's that can be changed we
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
could uh offer a different
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
proposal uh by which we would would do
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
the uh procurements and the commission
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
would review that I I would note um and
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
I I can't recall if Mr spidel touched
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
upon this but just an example of that
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
discretion I believe all three of the
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
investor-owned utilities that are R
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
regulated in the most recent orders
 
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
approving our default Service rates the
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
commission ordered all of us to provide
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
plans to them in February having uh 10
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
to 20% of the procurement being uh
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
directly from the market from the day
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
ahead market so you know that's a good
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
example of of flexibility again
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
obviously requires commission approval
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
in order to do that um but the I think
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
the the point that's made is being made
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
is there's flexibility in the law but
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
it's always subject to commission order
 
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.390 align:start position:0%
it's always subject to commission order
and

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
approval followup um th thank you um and
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
you know like representative Parell i'
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
I'd be very interested in and seeing
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
your amendment can you can you just give
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
us a Cliffs note version of you know
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
what that would entail yeah it's uh it's
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward I didn't change
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
we didn't change the uh addition of
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable price stability our view is
 
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's a public policy determination of
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh and it just says that
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
utilities have the authority to
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
competitively procure Electric Supply
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
through contracts of standard links
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
entered into with wholesale suppliers at
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
various times during the year prior
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
approval representative reol has a
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I have a
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
brief question and then and I'd like a
 
00:59:08.599 --> 00:59:11.349 align:start position:0%
brief question and then and I'd like a
followup

00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
followup
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
um um you you stated I think we all we
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
all understand but you just stated it in
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony that um eversource
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
providing default Energy Service all the
 
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
utilities provide energy default service
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
it it's a pass through of market cost to
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
Consumers and therefore you don't make
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
any money on it is it fair to say then
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
that utilities are indifferent to
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
whether customers remain on default
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
service or choose competitive Supply
 
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely by law we have to be
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
indifferent to it if customers want to
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
be served by a competitive supplier or
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
aggregation that is their choice and has
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
no impact on the utility okay okay then
 
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.549 align:start position:0%
no impact on the utility okay okay then
shouldn't

00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
would would you agree that our message
 
01:00:02.109 --> 01:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
then to Consumers of all sizes
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
residential or big
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
business energy consumers who want more
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
price stability in their energy
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
bills uh than is available currently
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
from default service should choose a
 
01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.549 align:start position:0%
from default service should choose a
competitive

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
supplier uh I guess I can't speak for
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
what the the legislator's message to
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
consumers would be or should be but I I
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
will say in uh our messages to customers
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
we actively promote the opportunity for
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
them to to shop for competitive Supply
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
and you know whether it's seeking lower
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
cost whether it's seeking price
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
stability there are options available to
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
them and we try our very best to promote
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
those options certainly especially when
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
the prices go way up uh and they're
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
they're seeking uh a break on their
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
their costs represent ative McGee has a
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Lata for taking my question so it
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
seems as we're going around here what um
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about price stability
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about basically the intent
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it uh was the result of
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
a retained bill that we had a
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on that we worked on last
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
year and obviously we were doing that in
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
response to the price spikes and trying
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
to figure out some solution where we
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
could say to people that we've tried to
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
take steps to help um address those
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
types of spikes but what I'm hearing
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
here today is that it sounds like we may
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
be trying to apply the wrong Solution by
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
saying the Pu shall do this and that
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
when the Pu already has a mandate to try
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
and address those types of issues um
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
based on existing statutory language so
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh would it be your position that the
 
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
way we could get at the solution that
 
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to offer is to is to p pass
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
a bill that suggests that the
 
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
utilities um maybe more actively take
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
consideration of lading into the
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
contracts that they enter into in order
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
to bring
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
um in order to bring the benefits of
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
lading if there are any in in the
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they might apply to
 
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
give you the sort of
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
the not a mandate but uh permission
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
structure I don't know so I I you know I
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to sort of punt the the
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
question but it truly is a public policy
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
decision of the legislature of what they
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
want default service to be so default
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
service right now in statute is sort of
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
a social safety net that is available to
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
all customers to ensure that they have
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
access to to energy Supply so if for
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason creditworthiness or or
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it is they can't get
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
supply from a third party there is
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
always this this safety net um adding
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
price stability as one of the goals
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
along with universal access you know
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
does fundamentally change what the
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
product is and how one would go about
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
procuring it so so if I I would suggest
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature the the committee the
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
legislature you know consider what is
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
the goal the aim that they want TOA
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
service to be certainly price stability
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
is is a noble goal um and you know has
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
benefits to it as has been discussed you
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
know sometimes it can be helpful from a
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
cost perspective sometimes it can be
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
harmful given where the market prices
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
are going in the timing of those those
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
procurements just followup followup can
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
I just get your input or your thought
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
around um how the competitive markets
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
factor into the default service rate and
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
whether um whether you see comp you know
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
a truly competitive market as being
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
maybe more assistance to consumers in
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
terms of versus
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
lading um I I think the challenge with
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
competitive supply has always been
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
customer awareness and acceptance so
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
number one that customers are are aware
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
that these options exist uh and number
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
two sort of customer acceptance we we
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
get the questions oh like if I go on
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply from you know Acme uh
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
energy who's going to come fix the line
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
during the storm and you know it's it's
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
eversource it's still us um and so you
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
know people are are by Nature skeptical
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
of change and I think um Mr spidel
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
talked about the stickiness of of
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
consumers so you know there are products
 
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh that are available again you know
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal aggregations are one um that
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
can provide savings can provide longterm
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
term stability and I think the the
 
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
barrier there is is again just awareness
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
of those as and sort of customer
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
acceptance of change and there is you
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
know there there is some risk uh you
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
know if you enter into a two-year
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
contract which might seem good at the
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
start if the market comes down in
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
default Service rates which again every
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
six months change comes down you may be
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
paying a higher price and you know that
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
consumers all right uh representative
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
sumers has a question thank you Mr
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
question so just so I gather an
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
understanding uh last year New Hampshire
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
co-op practiced lading and the where the
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
utilities could not and the rate
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
remained about half the price throughout
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
the year is it just coincidence that by
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
lading it was half the price of what the
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
utilities were without lading
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
so I no longer work at the Electric
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
Co-op so I'm not going to speak to their
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh procurement practices um they they do
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh they do not while they set their rate
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
every six months um I I think they
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
certainly do procure differently um
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
how they do that the the types of
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
contracts that they enter into what's
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
long-term and short-term again I I can't
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
speak to um I I would
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
say as I just said to to representative
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
McGee sometimes it's to the good
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's the bad um when the rates
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
change in February we will you know
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
eversource and and um I think other
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
investor owned utilities who are rate
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
regulated will be a little bit lower
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
than the co-op um so you know it it es
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
and flows I guess is is what I would
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
suggest and again I I can't speak to
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.839 --> 01:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
anymore

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay re representative Thomas Wendy
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
Thomas has another question thank you Mr
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
chair quick question um still stuck on
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut um can you
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
tell me how long the program has been in
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
place and is there any talk of repeal
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
from either of those
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
States um I will have to check on both
 
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.109 align:start position:0%
States um I will have to check on both
of

01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
those okay seeing no other questions I
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
want to thank Mr Lata for his
 
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.589 align:start position:0%
want to thank Mr Lata for his
informative

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
informative
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and give the last word as we
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
very often to to the office of the
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate so Mr Don cre happy
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
New Year and welcome again to
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:08:02.069 align:start position:0%
New Year and welcome again to
stn

01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
it is not on ah now it's on good morning
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose members of the committee
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh as most of you remember I'm Don Cree
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
I am the consumer Advocate my job is to
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
Advocate on behalf of residential
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
utility customers it's a great pleasure
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
to testify today and I thank the
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
chairman for allowing me to bat cleanup
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
because that means that I don't have to
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
say very much because I agree with
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
everything the proceeding Witnesses have
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
already said and uh my recommendation to
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
the committee is not to move forward
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
with this bill and I have eight discret
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
points that I want to make very quickly
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
one is that you are thinking of
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
legislating about default service at an
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
unusual and I would even argue maybe an
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
inopportune moment for a couple of
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
reasons one is that Community power
 
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
aggregation in New Hampshire is in the
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
process of taking flight and there's a
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
major shift in the default service load
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
from default service into Community
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
power aggregation and what that means is
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
that the companies that uh submit bids
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the utilities to provide default
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
service are a little freaked out and
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
their risk premium is likely to be a
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
little higher than it ordinarily would
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
be and the other reason I think we're at
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
a weird time is that this winter marks
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
the end of the reliability must run
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
contract for Mystic station and the
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
pendency of that contract for Fairly
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
elaborate reasons that I could go into
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
if you're interested that too has
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
increased risk premiums uh in the
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
default service Market that our
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
customers and other customers in other
 
01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
states have paid that's coming to an end
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
in May and I actually think that is one
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why the price of default
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
service has taken a welcome decline uh
 
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
in the current coming period of February
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
1 1 to uh July 31st uh Point number two
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
is in in a perfect world every customer
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would have three
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
options available to her one would be to
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
stay on the utilties default service two
 
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
would be to be uh participating in their
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
local community power aggregation
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
program and three uh uh competitive
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
suppliers um and you know it's it's kind
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
of interesting and encouraging to hear
 
01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
you all thinking about what more we can
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
do to inform customers about the
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
availability of competitive Supply and I
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
would suggest taking a look at Believe
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
It or Not Texas because the Texas I
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
think it's the Pu has a really robust
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and very userfriendly
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
website that they use to help customers
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
find competitive power supply options
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
that meet whatever their personal needs
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
are so there's something to consider um
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
Point number three the Pu if you've been
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
reading their recent orders about
 
01:11:00.669 --> 01:11:00.679 align:start position:0%
default service is actively flirting
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
with the idea of moving part of the
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
default service portfolio into the spot
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
Market as the residential rate payer
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
advocate in the state I am very leery
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
about that the spot Market is a very
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
scary place to send residential utility
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
customers because it is pretty volatile
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
now the Pu is talking about a pretty
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
small percentage of the default service
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
load going into the spot Market but
 
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
still I'm pretty skeptical and that
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
leads into Point number four which is my
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
sense and I've been consumer advocate
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
for a fairly long time now is that
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
residential customers really like price
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
stability that's important to most of
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
them very few residential customers want
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
to ride the wave of volatile wholesale
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
electricity prices and because price
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
stability is an imperative for
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
residential customers there always is
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
going to be a risk premium because price
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
stability by definition transfers risk
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
away from the user and places it on the
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
shoulders of the supplier and the
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
supplier has to uh charge a little extra
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
money in order to do that that's just an
 
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.229 align:start position:0%
money in order to do that that's just an
economic

01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
reality um Point number five uh and I
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
was really glad to hear my friend Tom
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
France mention this uh it is a good idea
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
for the state to consider a variety of
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
potential approaches to default service
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
he mentioned a descending clock auction
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea you might consider
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
doing that in the context of having all
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
of the state's default service procured
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the same time in one room someplace
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh that might have some economic
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
advantages in lower default service
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
prices Point number six uh
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman mentioned eight
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
rate cases a uh six straight cases a
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
year and I I just want to make sure that
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
there isn't any confusion about
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
terminology when the Pu reviews default
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
service filings it isn't conducting a
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
rate case a rate case is a huge
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
undertaking we have one pending now with
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
Liberty Utilities Liberty has about 12
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
different Witnesses who have submitted
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
written testimony I have five witnesses
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
who have submitted testimony for the OCA
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the department of energy has six or
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
seven or eight Witnesses and it takes a
 
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
whole year to go through that reviewing
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
a default service proposal from an
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
investor on utility is a much more
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
discreet uh uh undertaking that mostly
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
involves making sure that there really
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
was a competitive uh bidding process and
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
that the price that the utility obtained
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
really does reflect the market price of
 
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh of wholesale and Retail electricity
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
um uh Point number
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
seven is that the cheapest way of
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
procuring default service is in fact and
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
this goes to what representative Summers
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
was talking about is to do what the New
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Cooperative does the
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Electric Cooperative
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't just ladder it has an active and
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing portfolio
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
management uh process that really
 
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
resembles what a vertically integrated
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
utility would have done prior to
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
restructuring which is to say they
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
aren't just staggering the expiration
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
date of their contracts they have at
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
least one super long-term contract I
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
mean by super longterm I'm thinking you
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
know in the order of 25 years with at
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
least one energy facility and they do
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
make some spot purchases and they have
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
other contracts in their portfolio of
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
varying lengths so the question becomes
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
why don't we ask our investor-owned
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
utilities to do that and the answer is
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
that they don't really have an incentive
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
to do it as well as the cooperative does
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative is owned by its
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
customers so whatever value is derived
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
from that method of procuring default
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
service in uras to the benefits of the
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
owners of the company but for the
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
investor on utilities there's no
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
percentage literally and they're doing a
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
really awesome aggressive Vigilant job
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
of acquiring default service because
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
there's no markup for them when they
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
acquire default service so I guess my
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
last point is that although you could
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
change a lot of the shs to maze in the
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh or do what uh uh my friend Mike
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
lato was suggesting I think the better
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
course is essentially to let the Public
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission handle this uh
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
because it has told you it intends to do
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
that even uh the existing law gives the
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
Pu The Authority already to do
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
everything that we've been talking about
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
here today if you enact a bill though
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
there is a St a Canon of statutory
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
construction that says that the
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't waste its time by
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
enacting bills that mean nothing so
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's always this presumption that you
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
intended some change in law and I would
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
urge you not to change the law really
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of letting the
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
restructuring act do its job at a time
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
when the restructuring act might finally
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
start yielding some real benefits for
 
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers thanks to
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
this incredible experiment we're
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
embarking on called Community power
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
aggregation I hope you realize that the
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation programs
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
particularly the community power
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire is on its way
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
to becoming the biggest load serving
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
entity in the state that's going to have
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
a big effect on retail electricity in
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I think we need to see
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
what that effect is I'm hoping it's good
 
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm not guaranteeing it but we are
 
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
in the midst of that big experiment
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
which makes this not the best time to
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
legislate I think that's everything I
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
have to say by way of of points thank
 
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to testify I'd
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
be happy to sit here and answer
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions for as long as representative
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
o is willing to let
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
me well thank you I do have a couple of
 
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
quick questions for you the first one is
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
don't Community aggregation or
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
aggregators like the community power
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
Coalition and competitive suppliers
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
aren't they also subject to risk
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
premiums yes absolutely I mean anytime
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
you uh opt for Price certainty the
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
counterparty to those contracts is
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
taking on is charging you a risk premium
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
so that's certainly true of the
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition it's true of
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
the Electric Co-op it's true to the
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
utilities it's true to the competitive
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
suppliers so is a risk premium the
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
culprit here or
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
not ye well
 
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
yes uh and and what we see now is a uh
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
calming down of the uh electricity
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
market so that default Energy Service
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
prices have come down to earth so when
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a price like 8.1 cents
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour which is the new rate
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
for the community power Coalition or 8.3
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
cents which is eversource's new rate I
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
mean there's a risk premium embedded in
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
that rate that's still higher than the
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
you know spot price that's probably
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
prevailing right this minute at ISO New
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
England but again it's because
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
residential customers in particular and
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of commercial customers as
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
well want price stability so those two
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
rates are in place for a six-month
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
period so maybe what you're saying is
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
that rates contain wholesale supplier
 
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
rates contain a risk premium but
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes they also contain a panic
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
premium yes that is true and I think
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
that is a big explan or a major
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
explanation of what we've seen in the
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
last two
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:54.199 align:start position:0%
question the reason this bill is is
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
before us and the reason we're here
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
discussing it is because we have
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
constituents coming to us when we have
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
these price spikes saying what the heck
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
are you guys going to do about the cost
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
electricity so how do you suggest that
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
we respond to our constituents when they
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
start flooding our email inboxes and our
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
telephone voicemail boxes with
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
complaints about the cost of energy well
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
I I I would think the first thing you
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
would tell them is look at where the
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
price of default Energy service is now
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
relative to where it was two years ago
 
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
if you want as a political matter you
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
can take credit for it uh but I would
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
say uh that you can also refer them to
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
the Pu because you heard Mr spidel tell
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
you in effect that the Pu is on the case
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
and I I go to all the hearings they are
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
on the case they are actively engaged uh
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
chairman goldner is I think pretty
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
obsessed with making some pretty big
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
changes with the way that default
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
service is procured I I'm going to try
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
to convince him to be pretty careful
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
about that but he seems pretty
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
determined so you can refer your
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
constituents to you can refer them to me
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
because I never leave any query
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
unanswered especially one that's
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
referred from legislators so I I hope
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
those are that's helpful I mean I but I
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
hear you uh chairman Vose I know that
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
you all get constit calls and it is easy
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
or it's preferable for you to be able to
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
say to your constituents well yes we're
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
doing something we're we're enacting
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
house bills
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
1617 uh but I would urge you to be
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
careful and consider not doing that
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
nonetheless okay I'll take your advice
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
and congratulate my fellow legislators
 
01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
on lowering the price of energy over the
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
last six months yes indeed
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
congratulations to all of you all right
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:54.910 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr
cre

01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none it looks like you've done a
 
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
fabulous job as you usually do covering
 
01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
all the points you wanted to make and so
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.149 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your testimony thank you
very

01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
much and since I have no more pink cards
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm going to close the
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
1617 and that will take us to House Bill
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
1697 and so I'm going to open that
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing and before I call on the
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
Bill's Prime sponsor I'm going to lay
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
out some ground rules for this public
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
hearing I have
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
17 pink cards 17 people who would like
 
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.910 align:start position:0%
17 pink cards 17 people who would like
to

01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
speak looks like another one is winding
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
its way in my direction so 18 pink cards
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh of people who would like to speak or
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
19 so given the fact that it is now
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
10:20 the likelihood of us getting
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
through all 19 of these pink cards today
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
is virtually nil so I want to alert you
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
all to the possibility in fact the very
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
real probability that this public
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
hearing will be
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
recessed and will be resumed at a future
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
date so you may not get a chance
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill today I want you
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
to be aware of that before we start
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
now on the other hand there is a
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that once the prime sponsor
 
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
introduces this bill and explains to us
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
mistake some of you may decide you don't
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
want to testify and that would be
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful if that proved to be the state
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
Pro proved to be the
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
case so let's start and see where this
 
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.110 align:start position:0%
case so let's start and see where this
takes

01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
takes
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
us I will say that I'm going to cut this
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
off at about
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
11:15 and uh we have other matters that
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with today so we're not
 
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
going to go beyond
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
11:15 so with that I'd like to call Arie
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
Davis representative Arnold Davis to
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 1697 suspending New
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's participation in emissions
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
reduction credit programs for a period
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
of two
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
years and representative Davis will
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
explain to us why that's not really what
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
he wanted to do okay go ahead thank you
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%

01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%

house bill
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
1697 and there was a misunderstanding as
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
the chairman said between OS and myself
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
the original Bill did not accomplish
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
what I had intended it to do
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
I worked with the Attorney General's
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
office on the language and would like to
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%

01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
bill and offer it to you today for your
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%

amendment please

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
order for the general court to develop a
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
plan to properly regulate such
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
sales such

125j

01:24:53.229 --> 01:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
125j
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
any any person requiring carbon credits
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
and offsets to become carbon neutral or
 
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
to meet emission requirements May
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
purchase such credits and offsets from
 
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
purchase such credits and offsets from
other

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
sources from any
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
source that is not New Hampshire
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
Woodlands if the ACT is deemed
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that any person who has
 
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
entered into the a contract to purchase
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
sell or trade carbon credits or
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
offsets that was affected by the
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
suspension of the sale of carbon credits
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
and offsets may still be liable for any
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
rules or taxes pertaining to such
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
contract this act shall take effect upon
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
passage so that is basically the
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
amendment which is the
 
01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
amendment which is the
bill

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe this is a vital piece of
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
legislation one that is dire to to our
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
state into our way of life this bill is
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
truly a bipartisan effort as it has the
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
support of all seven delegation members
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
in Coos County and all three County
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I will keep my
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
introduction brief as you will be
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
hearing from experts in their respective
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
Fields who know much more about their
 
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
trades than I do and I do not want to be
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
redundant now let me be clear that we
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
are not opposed to the Commerce of cbon
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
credits and offsets as a to the
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
Woodlands of New Hampshire the purpose
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to Simply give the state
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire a brief pause so that
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
we can properly regulate these sales we
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
understand that property owners have
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
rights and we are not looking to
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
infringe upon them our intent is to find
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
a balance where cin credits and offsets
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
may be sold without harming the timber
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
indust timber industry loggers truckers
 
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
Sawmills and everyone else that this
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
trickles down to to without harming the
 
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
timber tax benefits derived from our
 
01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
towns without the loss of countless jobs
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
and at the same time keeping our forests
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
properly managed and keeping the land
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
open to recreation in short we are
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
looking for best management practices
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
that will benefit both the land owners
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
would like to thank you for your time
 
01:27:17.639 --> 01:27:18.590 align:start position:0%
would like to thank you for your time
and

01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you representative
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
for introducing this
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislation just for
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
clarity I want to ask you is it your
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
position that we should
 
01:27:34.239 --> 01:27:36.310 align:start position:0%
position that we should
consider

01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that does nothing to the
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
gas um initiative yes I Reggie would not
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
be affected by this bill Reggie would
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
not be affected by this bill at all
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay and it was never
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
your intention to suspend reie Reggie
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
for two years no it was not okay so I
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
just want everybody who plans to testify
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
on this bill to understand that this
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
bill is not about
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
Reggie this bill is about something
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
completely different representative
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
question representative Harrington has a
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
question sorry I saw a hand waving over
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman I please
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
apologize to representative McGee for
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
thinking she looked like
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
me um my question is this you do you
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
mention uh private land there so it see
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I get the
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill it seems as what
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying is it's going to be a a
 
01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
two-year moratorium so if I'm a private
 
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
land owner and I was approached by
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
someone who wanted to buy carbon credits
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
for my forested land I'm assuming that
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
would mean if I signed that contract I
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't cut down the wood so with this
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
bill as amend Ed in effect say no one
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
including private land owners can enter
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
into these contracts and hence prevent
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
them from cutting the wood down of
 
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
course they could still not cut the wood
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
down but this would say you can't enter
 
01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
in a contract that mandates that the
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
wood not be cut is that correct that's
 
01:29:12.109 --> 01:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank
 
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
muns has a question thank you
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh for uh clarifying the
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill um I'm I'm a
 
01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
flatlander I live down on the Sea Coast
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
um what what uh precipitated this what
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
why why the need for this bill what what
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
what's going on that we don't know about
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
well private private companies are
 
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.189 align:start position:0%
well private private companies are
buying

01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
buying
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
property and instead of harvesting
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
Timber they are selling carbon offsets
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
so where I live the tax base is is
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
heavily based around around Timber tax
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
it it's uh creating a loss of jobs it's
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
creating loss of Timber tax to the
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
towns um I would like to make sure that
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
the the land stays open for
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
recreation and Hunting Fishing
 
01:30:07.119 --> 01:30:09.430 align:start position:0%
recreation and Hunting Fishing
snowmobiling

01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
OHV um and it's we're not trying to stop
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
it we are just trying to let selling
 
01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
carbon credits and offsets
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
coexist with harvesting Timber we're
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to not do away and harm the
 
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.709 align:start position:0%
we're trying to not do away and harm the
timber

01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719 align:start position:0%
timber
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
industry uh and that's that's where
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're at we're trying to find a a middle
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
together representative Wendy Thomas has
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair um
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
actually representative Ms um asked the
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
question that I had which was what
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
precipitated this um request for a bill
 
01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
um in the bill you you talk about uh a
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
period of two years how did you come up
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
with two years what does that mean
 
01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
we need a little bit of time to to look
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
into this and see where if if you put
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
land into current use you need to put it
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
into a registry and so we would like to
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
have some sort of registry where if you
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
intent to uh sell carbon offsets it
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
would there would be a registry right
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
now nobody knows who's who's doing what
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh maybe some sort of of
 
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh Timber tax if we you say for for the
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
loss of the Timber tax when you if you
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
harvest Timber I if I was going to
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
harvest Timber I would have to fill out
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
an intent to cut and then I would pay a
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
10% Timber tax which goes to the towns
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
so selling
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
offsets you're you're making commer with
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
that same Timber even though you're not
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
cutting it the town's losing their money
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
which they heavily depend on in Coos
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
County and and I don't know about the
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the state but I would imagine so
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh so we'll looking to protect that
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking to protect the logging
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
industry if you're a second third
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
generation logger in Pittsburgh New
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you have uh it's very
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
expensive for that equipment if
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
you go out of business because there's a
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
lack of work those jobs aren't coming
 
01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:11.719 align:start position:0%
back nobody's going to go from
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
Whitefield to Lancaster up to Pittsburgh
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
to cut low grade Timber it's just not
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
industry followup
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um you mentioned um a registry
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned study um do you see the
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
county setting up a committee to to look
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
into this alongside independent but
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
alongside of this legislation yes I I
 
01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
just don't want it to go to interterm
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
study because that's a polite way to
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
kill something uh I I think we could
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
form a committee that could look into
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
this very quickly and working with Dr
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
working with uh excuse me I'm meant a
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee outside of the the legislature
 
01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
like a county committee yeah I I I think
 
01:32:57.159 --> 01:32:59.830 align:start position:0%
like a county committee yeah I I I think
you're

01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
right all right before we uh move along
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify a situation I'm going
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
to call on you for but for the moment I
 
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.990 align:start position:0%
want to
clarify

01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
that the draft amendment that
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative Davis read to us during
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
his testimony is quite different from
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
what the original Bill text
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
was there is possibly a question about
 
01:33:30.119 --> 01:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
was there is possibly a question about
the

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
gerain of that Amendment
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
text but I have
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
decided not to waste the time of
 
01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
everybody who showed up here this
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
morning by saying that we can't discuss
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
that Amendment text because that is what
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
we will go forward with we won't go go
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
forward with the original Bill
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
text so I want everybody to understand
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
that even though I haven't spoken to the
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
speaker about it yet there is a
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
possibility that this amendment is non-
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
gerine and if it is then we're going to
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
have to have another public hearing on
 
01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
have to have another public hearing on
that

01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment but in the interest of saving
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
time for people who have traveled here
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
this morning I'm going to continue with
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
our questioning and our
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on the idea of the proposed
 
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
draft amendment that representative
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
Davis has suggested to us just so we can
 
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
get a sense of what it really is all
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
about and what its implications might be
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
if we decide to move forward with it
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
with that I'll call on res uh
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative McGee for a question
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um and thank you
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question since I've had
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
conversations representative with
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
yourself and others in the North Country
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and also um I spoke with the
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Society
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the protection of forests about this
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
bill um I I wondered if you it seems
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
like people are curious how the bill
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
came about and in your
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
explanation um you didn't really mention
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
the change that's happened with this
 
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
purchase in other words the way the land
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
was being maintained the sustainable
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
harvesting um is really one of the main
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
things that's changed right so it's not
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just the timber tax but it's
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
also um the guarantee of the owners of
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
the land that it will be sustainably
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
harvested and forested for the
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
protection of the land and we I know we
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
had that discussion so I'm just
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could say a little more
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
about what's changed um which really
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
prompted this well it's not just one
 
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
sorry uh it's not just one piece of land
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about if uh one parcel was
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
purchased in Pittsburgh and that has a
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
significant effect on on our County uh
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
other parles that will follow I'm just
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get ahead of the curve here
 
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
and and would I mean it's very early and
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
into okay seeing no other questions for
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Davis I want to move
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
along here we have a lot of people who
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
would like to say something about this
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
situation Mr chairman yes Joe Kenny the
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
executive counselor was supposed to
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
speak here this morning he was here for
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
9:30 he the other Bill ran over he left
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
testimony can I if uh bring them up to
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
you I was about to call on counselor
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
Kenny well I didn't realize he left
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
he'll be back if he can he said if if
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is still going on
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
when okay I'll put his card on the
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
bottom of the pile and if he makes it
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
back we'll call on him next is um Robert
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:25.310 align:start position:0%
 
County

01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee uh my name
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
is Robert Tiel I was a representative
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
for 22 years so and I know what it's
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
like being shairing of a committee so I
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
will be very very brief um the uh the
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
bill has had a a tremendous impact in
 
01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
the North Country you mentioned how has
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
started about but in Pittsburgh when uh
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
loose Source purchased the land they
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
stopped harvesting of the Timber which
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
resulted in the mile and Lumber Company
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
being closed for three weeks because it
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't get uh lumber at all there's an
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
important economic aspect to this bill
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities look forward to
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
recreational use of land this may have a
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
negative impact on them but more
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
importantly if a municipality can't
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
can't purchase land for Workforce
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
housing that will not benefit anybody at
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
all and for Progress um we've talked
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
about the timber or the forested lands
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
what is not mentioned in this bill in in
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
the future not only will forested lands
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
be affected but any agricultural land
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
for carbon
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
credits thank you I'll be brief okay we
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate revity believe me uh any
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions for The Honorable
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative yes um representative
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you and thank you for
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my first reaction
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
to this is that you're going to put a
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
moratorium on people have that own their
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
own property saying I want to enter into
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
a contract that's legal and it's going
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
to say I don't cut down wood on my
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
property well it's my property I should
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to make that decision
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I I mean where are we going to
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
go next when we can tell people you
 
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
can't do this with your property because
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
we want you to cut wood we're going to
 
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
force people to cut wood on their
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
property is that the next
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
step I think there's a misunderstanding
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh if uh individuals work
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know enter into contract with uh an
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
entity for carbon credits um I'm I'm
 
01:39:45.629 --> 01:39:45.639 align:start position:0%
sure they can negotiate what the terms
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
would be um some municipalities
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
California has gone way way way out on a
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
limb with this not allowing U harvesting
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
of Timbers and and whatnot so I I think
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's a it would
 
01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
benefit U both entities the land owner
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
and whoever wants to you purchase for uh
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
carbon credits to come with some type of
 
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
agreement which I feel is reasonable
 
01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.510 align:start position:0%
agreement which I feel is reasonable
moving

01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
forward follow
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
up followup okay but so I'm getting
 
01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
clear so what the bill says we don't
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
have in front of us but just want to
 
01:40:23.229 --> 01:40:23.239 align:start position:0%
make it clear what this bill have passed
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
it would say for 2 years no one is
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to sign a contract for carbon
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
credits hence they couldn't sign a
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
contract to sell someone we're not going
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
to cut down a wood on my property no
 
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's not the case of theill would you
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
explain what it is then because maybe
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
I'm misunderstanding it well I think
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
representative Davis could do a better
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
job of that or um Mike wette
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative Mike bant um the there's
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
no moror on S selling or purchasing land
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's just a moratorium on how carbon
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
credits are to be used in the future uh
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
what is u a problem with the whole thing
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
and speaking with the Dr is uh how are
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
you going to do uh when it comes to um
 
01:41:11.229 --> 01:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh taxing carbon credits that's an
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
entirely different ball of
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
wax Mr chairman could I make a
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
suggestion here since we don't have the
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us and since there
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
seems to be quite a bit confusion about
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
it exactly does and does not do I would
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
suggest until we get a copy of the bill
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
so we can look at it and make some um
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
intelligent questions that we suspend
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing because without the copy of
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
the bill we just be getting bounced
 
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
around all over the place that is a
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable request and I have just
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
learned uh from a visit with the house
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
clerk that because this bill affects the
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
same section of law as the
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
original originally fed bill it is
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
Germain therefore I'm going to ask
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Davis to pass out copies
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
of his proposed amendment so that we can
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
discussing does that does that excuse me
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
does that uh satisfy your your concern
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington thank you it
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
does okay please go ahead and answer the
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
question well I was waiting for support
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
from uh you know re pres of Davis and
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
also Mike wette representative wet are
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
more in tune to what's going on
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill because they've been
 
01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
working on it for a number of weeks um
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know I stepped in as a kind of
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner because we totally
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
understand what the problem would be
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
facing uh the timber industry which is a
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
really important uh the logging industry
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
is extremely important in the North
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
country has it would have a negative
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
impact if uh contracts are issued where
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
timber who do we have uh
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
here joining me is uh representative
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
Mike wette oh this is representative
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
wette yes nice to see you again sir I'm
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill I'm sorry no
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and U I have a card
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
from you uh I was going to call on you
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
but go ahead since you're there well I
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
just come up to support Mr T um and to
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
answer the question we're not trying to
 
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
stop uh uh uh wood cutting or carbon
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
sales uh as if this passes through and
 
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh we create the legislation um what
 
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
we're saying is if there's some fees or
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
something is going to be due um they'll
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
be retroactive to where we are but we're
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
anything okay additional questions
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGee and this is based
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
on the language in the bill um I I
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
understand the idea of um allowing sales
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
to go forward but uh but people will not
 
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
have the certainty of understanding you
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
know where you're going to land right so
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
it may actually affect the market anyway
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
right people may not want to enter into
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
a deal where they don't know the outcome
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
so um it sounds like what you're saying
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
is you want to impose um a moratorium in
 
01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
order to figure out a solution but you
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what the collateral impacts
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
of that's going to be on the economy for
 
01:44:34.589 --> 01:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
for large tracks of Woodland own owners
 
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
you know for land
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
owners that's that is correct um and and
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's um we've been working on this for a
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
number of months many months and it is a
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
very complex Hydra of of questions and
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
an answers and trying at the same time
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
to protect everybody's property rights
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
and uh protect our way of life so um
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
this moratorium is just to give us time
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
to create something that is uh
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
acceptable and workable to protect the
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes please do a
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
followup because I'm than I'm confused
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
about some of this language um I I I am
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
curious in listening to the testimony
 
01:45:20.159 --> 01:45:21.950 align:start position:0%
curious in listening to the testimony
whether

01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh that solution could be worked on
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
bill we don't I think part of
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
the issue is that we want to make sure
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we're protecting all property long
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
term and when we talk about people's
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
properties you know uh we want to
 
01:45:51.390 --> 01:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
protect the guy that's got 40
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
acres um the Pittsburgh Property that
 
01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
was mentioned it's a little different
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
because there's easements on the
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
property but just to be clear that's 225
 
01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
square miles on one piece of property
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
that's had a great effect on not only
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
North Country but the state of New
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there's another piece in
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
Colombia it's 8,000 Acres I mean that's
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
many miles square miles of
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
property um so we're just trying to get
 
01:46:20.830 --> 01:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
ahead of the curve slow things down make
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
a a workable solution to protect the
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
again the state of New
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow up to that if I'm
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
allowed go ahead would be um what effect
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
you think this bill will have in
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
assisting you with any negotiation or
 
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
determination um because if the bill
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
passes then the people that you'll be
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
talking to the effed people may have
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
more incentive to come to the table and
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
participate in a process to try and
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
figure out Solution that's really the
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
only thing I can see that would be
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
enabled by a change like
 
01:47:01.149 --> 01:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
this and that is true but the there's a
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
lot of uh facets to this uh between uh
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
Timber values uh Recreation and a lot of
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
it is is way of life that we have in in
 
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I think that if you a
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
little patient and hear some of the
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
other uh people testify it's going to
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
expound on on your
 
01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.149 align:start position:0%
expound on on your
question

01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
so representative Harrington has a
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
question now that I have the bill in
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
front of me I'm more confused than ever
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
um it says the department of cultural
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
and natural resources shall suspend the
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
sale of carbon credits and offsets from
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
The Woodlands of New Hampshire for two
 
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
years then it goes on to say such
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
suspension shall not stop the purchase
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
of carbon credits and offsets in the
 
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and then it goes
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
on to say offsets
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
p May purchase credits and offsets from
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
any source that is not in New Hampshire
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
Woodland so what is it is there a
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
two-year suspension of let me put it
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
this way I own land I want to someone
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
approaches me they say I want to sign a
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
contract with you for carbon credits
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
because I have a factory in Oklahoma
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
that produces carbon dioxide and I want
 
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
to go carbon neutral so I'm going to
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
sign a contract with you for 10 years
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
and I will pay you not to cut down any
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
wood on your property is that contract
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
let's say for two years because we get
 
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
the two years is that contract barred by
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
this two-year suspension of the sale of
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
offsets in my opinion no so what is bar
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
then excuse me um what we're going to
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
say is if you sell those carbon credits
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the legislation comes up that
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
there's some uh could be a time limit on
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
the amount time for the lease on the
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
carbon credits or could be a uh some
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a fee to make the town's
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
wholesale for the loss of Timber tax
 
01:49:01.149 --> 01:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
you'll be responsible for that down the
 
01:49:01.159 --> 01:49:02.790 align:start position:0%
you'll be responsible for that down the
road

01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
followup follow up that sounds like a
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
retroactive law which is
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional you can't tell someone
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
they can enter in a contract today and
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's legal and then two years from now
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
say oops we changed the law no
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
retroactively we're going to find
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
you I think this needs a lot more work
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's very very confusing it does I I
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't disagree but it takes time and be
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
assured uh everything that we've done
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
has gone through the Attorney General's
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
office it's nothing that we've taken off
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
the cuff and we're very conscientious to
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
make sure everything we do is legal and
 
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.550 align:start position:0%
make sure everything we do is legal and
and

01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional representative Harrington
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
turn off your mic please sorry okay uh
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative rolds has a question
 
01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um thank you
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank my colleague
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for his effort
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
to clarify because I'm kind of in the
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
same boat now just having having the

text of the bill in front of me I just
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
term from The Woodlands of New
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by and you would you would
 
01:50:11.679 --> 01:50:13.750 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by and you would you would
have

01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
state the department of cultural and
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
natural resources suspect the sale of
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
carbon credits and offsets from The
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
Woodlands of New Hampshire do you mean
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
the woodlands do you mean Parcels of
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
Woodland owned by the state of New
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or do you mean all Woodlands
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
all Parcels public and
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
private it would it would be all and
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
because I think thanks
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's okay um Miss okay I have a a
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
statement I'd like to read Mr chairman
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
if we have a second okay make it quick
 
01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
please okay uh let me start out by
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
saying that I support land owners rights
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
to sell carbon credits uh however carbon
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
credits derived from the timber could
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a devastating effect on the state's
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
economy and our traditional way of
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
life when our ancestors settled in the
 
01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
1600s over 90% of the land in the state
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire was forested by the
 
01:51:20.589 --> 01:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
mid- 1800s it was down to less than 40%
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
of our land was forested with the
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
majority being north of the White
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
Mountains today the state of New
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 82% forested which is only
 
01:51:31.629 --> 01:51:31.639 align:start position:0%
second to the state of
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
Maine uh the business of selling carbon
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
is that we're larger trees the larger
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
tree go the more carbon there is to sell
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
and my topic today is is how it affects
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
the sports and and
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
Recreation and you might ask what has to
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
sportsmen New Hampshire is a unique in
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
that hunters and fishermen have free
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
range to hunt and fish unencumbered all
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
over the state on primarily privately
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
owned land that is generously made open
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
public but the sale of Timberlands for
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
carbon credits could change
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
that uh young growing forests provide
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
food and habitat for most of our
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
Wildlife older mature forests contain
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
less feed less
 
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
animals with there being approximately
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
50,000 licensed Hunters and over 170,000
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
licensed fishermen in New Hampshire the
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
depletion of the state's wildli Wild
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
game would also affect over 2 billion
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollars uh that hunting and fishing
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
industries contribute to the state's
 
01:52:32.079 --> 01:52:34.510 align:start position:0%
industries contribute to the state's
economy

01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
annually every year when winter comes
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
about 45,000 snowmobiles are registered
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
across the state to ride New Hampshire's
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
7,000 miles of open Trails according to
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
an economic impact study made by the
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire the a
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
average economic impact of snow buers in
 
01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
state is estimated at $548 million
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
annually then once the snow has melted
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire opens over a th000
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
miles of ohrv trails to approximately
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
41,000 ohvs wheel Vehicles contributing
 
01:53:09.629 --> 01:53:09.639 align:start position:0%
an additional $465 million annually to
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
the state's
 
01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:15.639 align:start position:0%
economy over 80% of the state's Trails
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
reside on private property over
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:21.589 align:start position:0%
reside on private property over
80%

01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
80%
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
and what has that got to do with carbon
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
credits well unfortunately many of the
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
companies purchasing the land for
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
benefits of selling carbon credits have
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
an ESG policy that conflicts with the
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
allowance of motorized
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
Sports other areas across the country
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
have already felt the impact of
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
previously available lands haven't been
 
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
shut down to the public for the use of
 
01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
motorized Sports these potential
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
closures could eliminate an industry
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
that contributes nearly one billion
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
dollars to New Hampshire's
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
economy we need legislation to encourage
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
carbon sales but we also need to create
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
incentives for these landowners to
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
professionally manage their forest and
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
keep their land open for recreation and
 
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.910 align:start position:0%
keep their land open for recreation and
traditional

01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
traditional uses to our way of life it's
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
important that we pass this bill to give
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
us the necessary time to create
 
01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that will protect our land
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
owners our tourists and the economic
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
contributions of our state's outdoor
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
recreation Industries thank you so did I
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
understand you to say that
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
this carbon purchase carbon credit
 
01:54:24.239 --> 01:54:25.709 align:start position:0%
this carbon purchase carbon credit
purchase

01:54:25.709 --> 01:54:25.719 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
program is more is about more than just
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting it's also about
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
Recreation and the use of land Beyond
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting absolutely we we've
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
seen other uh areas across the country
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh being shut down um for uh carbon
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
sales and environmental uh reasons um
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
and like I said it's billions of dollars
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.149 align:start position:0%
the state of New
Hampshire

01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative muns has a question
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
I'd remind the members we have quite a
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
few more people would like to testify
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for um
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
enlightening us on this issue um I I I
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
was interested I found it interesting
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
that in your in your
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
statement you you did not mention the
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
timber tax uh how much of a motivator is
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislation it's like ific um and and
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's not just the timber tax but it's
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
the proper management of our forests uh
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
to we need the timber low grade Timber
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh in their North Country we need high-
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
grade timber for furniture Lumber um we
 
01:55:39.149 --> 01:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
Timber tax is is is also a good thing
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
but we need to properly manage our
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
forest for our wildlife habitat also
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's why I mean it's so many varied
 
01:55:49.390 --> 01:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
areas uh representative Davis myself and
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of the Coos County delegation
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
um very much P bipartisan are working on
 
01:55:58.270 --> 01:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
this together um and when we were going
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
to sit down here today try not to be
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
redundant um uh representative Davis
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
asked me if I would look at the
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
recreational part of it which I've been
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
involved with for many decades and so
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is my take on the uh recreational
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
part of the uh
 
01:56:16.109 --> 01:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
legislation upcoming legislation I
 
01:56:16.119 --> 01:56:18.350 align:start position:0%
legislation upcoming legislation I
should

01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
say okay okay representative L liwicki
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
has a question uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
presumably presumably this land is in
 
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
current use would the restrictions on it
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
um by the by an owner a new owner affect
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
that current use
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
status it depends on what their current
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
current uh uh use is meaning if they're
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
open to motorized Recreation now and
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
they close it then their current use
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
but we we we are very aware the success
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
of current use of State of New Hampshire
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
and um are not interested in making any
 
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
changes on the current use policies at
 
01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:04.470 align:start position:0%
changes on the current use policies at
this

01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
time representative Corman has a
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm wondering if
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
you can help me read this amendment uh
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm having a little trouble
 
01:57:16.069 --> 01:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
parsing it I think our chairman is also
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble parsing it I
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
think the rest of the committee is too
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
so let me give you an interpretation of
 
01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
how I'm reading this and you tell me if
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
I'm off the mark please if you if I'm
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
sorry excuse me if you don't mind I'm
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
gonna have representative Davis is the
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
one that's worked on this part of it and
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have him up so we make sure
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
answers are accurate that that's great I
 
01:57:39.629 --> 01:57:39.639 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I understand it
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
um so if C can we bring representative
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
Davis back to to help us with this it's
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
fine with me okay if one of the other
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you yes so the the first
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
sentence says the department of cultural
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
and natural resources shall suspend the
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
sale of carbon credits and offsets from
 
01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
The Woodlands of New Hampshire for two
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
years from the effective date of this
 
01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:15.669 align:start position:0%
years from the effective date of this
act

01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
Etc the second sentence says such
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
suspension shall not stop the purchasing
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
of carbon credits and offsets in the
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire Etc so am I
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
correct in interpreting it that the
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
first sentence says this state agency
 
01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
will no longer sell carbon credits and
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
offsets for two years but the second
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
sentence says that Private Sales may
 
01:58:44.669 --> 01:58:44.679 align:start position:0%
occur what what the intention of this is
 
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of cultural and natural
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
resources shall suspend the sale of
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
carbon credits and offsets in the wood
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
from The Woodlands of New Hampshire for
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
two years from the effective date of
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
this order so what that means is
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
suspending the sale of carbon carbon
 
01:59:08.189 --> 01:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
credits and offsets from timber in New
 
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for two years the the
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
reason is to allow the general court to
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
develop a plan to regulate these sales
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
right now they are unregulated there no
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
we have no idea who's selling them uh
 
01:59:25.149 --> 01:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
because they're sold generally to
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
California I don't know if they pay a
 
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
business profit tax to New Hampshire I
 
01:59:32.109 --> 01:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gets zero out of this deal
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
except for a loss of jobs uh such
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
suspension shall not stop the purchasing
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
of carbon credits and offsets in the
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire well there's
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's other programs other than the
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
Timberlands there's uh many other
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
programs that do not deal with with
 
01:59:55.470 --> 01:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
Timber so those can still be purchased
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not trying to stop that
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
and this shall not affect any other
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
emissions programs under RSA 125o and
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 125j so it does not affect Reggie
 
02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
does not affect any other plan or
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
program out there uh so if you if you
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
have a company and you're looking to
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
purchase uh Caron credit and offsets as
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
long as they don't come from the timber
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
of New
 
02:00:25.629 --> 02:00:25.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire buy them that
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
way yes yes follow up thank you okay so
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification uh my
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
my proposed interpretation was erroneous
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad to know that so let me just
 
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
make sure again that I understand so the
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
first sentence is saying that the sale
 
02:00:45.310 --> 02:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
of carbon credits and offsets from just
 
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
from The Woodlands of New Hampshire is
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
being suspended yes
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
all private sales of such credits are
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
suspended for two years is that correct
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
not not cutting Timber Just just the
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
credits just the credits yeah and then
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
the second sentence where it says such
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
suspension shall not stop the purchasing
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
of carbon credits and offsets what what
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
it's really saying is for anything other
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
than Woodlands yes okay it might help if
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
that was actually included in that
 
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
second this was filed late I wasn't able
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
to a redraft at
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
OS uh so I I'm willing to work on an
 
02:01:27.390 --> 02:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
amendment with the committee if that
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
good thank
 
02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
you all right so let's um let's suspend
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
any kind
 
02:01:38.189 --> 02:01:38.199 align:start position:0%
of critique of the language of the bill
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that before we go further
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
down into those weeds we understand the
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
concept and to that end I'm going to ask
 
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
ask you two gentlemen to step
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
aside because this bill will affect a
 
02:01:58.109 --> 02:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
particular piece of property in the
 
02:01:58.119 --> 02:01:58.950 align:start position:0%
particular piece of property in the
North

02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
North
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
Country more than any other a property
 
02:02:04.830 --> 02:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
called Aurora sustainable
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
lands and so I would like to hear from
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
Blake stamell who represents Aurora
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
sustainable lands to hear what he has to
 
02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
say about the approach of this proposed
 
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.109 align:start position:0%
say about the approach of this proposed
legislation

02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:02:20.119 --> 02:02:22.669 align:start position:0%
legislation
Mr

02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
stanel thank you Mr chairman um and
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
committee members appreciate the
 
02:02:32.669 --> 02:02:32.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here and uh again my
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
name's Blake stansil I'm the president
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
of Aurora sustainable
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
lands um we are the owner of the
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes Forest that's up in
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh Stewartstown and Clarksville
 
02:02:50.189 --> 02:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill is directly
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
targeted at us we um we didn't come
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
prepared with written statements about
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment because we've just seen it
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
but I think I can address everything
 
02:03:05.069 --> 02:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
that's been brought up here by giving
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
you a feel for uh what our company's all
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
about and the plans we have for managing
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
this forest
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it's worth saying right up
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
front um we
 
02:03:22.350 --> 02:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
we pay taxes in New Hampshire we pay
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
business tax we pay property tax we pay
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
Timber Severance tax um we there's a
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
road sharing agreement where we we pay
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh for a component of that so that's one
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
item that I'll talk some more about and
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
then secondly from a recreational
 
02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint the carbon program that we
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
have is absolutely compatible with
 
02:03:48.189 --> 02:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
recreational use and does not have an
 
02:03:48.199 --> 02:03:49.430 align:start position:0%
recreational use and does not have an
impact

02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh on the recreational side and then the
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
the logging piece which is probably of
 
02:03:56.910 --> 02:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
most interest uh to many in the North
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
Country I'd love to speak to that as
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
well so uh hope to be able to hit on all
 
02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
of those uh with some of my prepared
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
comments um first maybe just a few facts
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
about the property
 
02:04:15.149 --> 02:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
itself um it's the largest privately
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
held forest in the state that's open to
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
public rec
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
creation um the property has been
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
privately held under this working Forest
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
conservation easement since
 
02:04:33.149 --> 02:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
2003 um the easement provides
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
for uh continued Public Access in
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
perpetuity uh it provides for um the
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
property to be managed as a working
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
Forest so generating Forest Products for
 
02:04:49.549 --> 02:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing facility ities
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the region um the property
 
02:04:55.549 --> 02:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
has had a carbon project on it since
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
2013 so the the carbon project has been
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
around for uh for quite some time um our
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
company manages 1.65 million Acres
 
02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the United States with a
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of removing and storing
 
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
carbon from the
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
atmosphere um this property is very
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
similar to a lot of properties we manage
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
in other locations it's 146,000 Acres so
 
02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
clearly a big piece of property what's
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
unique about it is it does have a
 
02:05:32.189 --> 02:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
working Forest conservation easement on
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
it we have other assets that also uh
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
have easements but one thing I would say
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
is from the perspective of
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
Regulation this asset is probably one of
 
02:05:47.229 --> 02:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
the most regulated in our portfolio
 
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
already um there's a large amount of
 
02:05:54.189 --> 02:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
interaction between our forestry staff
 
02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
and the division of forests and
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
lands um we interact directly with the
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
local community uh there regular
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
meetings around Recreation and tourism
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
so from from that perspective absolutely
 
02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
see no reason to add
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
regulation uh around what we're
 
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.709 align:start position:0%
regulation uh around what we're
discussing

02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
today um and and then on the the timber
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
side uh just a few things to to comment
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
on because we we recognize the impact to
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
the North country as it relates to to
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
harvesting Timber we're going to
 
02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely continue to harvest as a
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
matter of fact uh harvesting is ongoing
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
on the property right now there's
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
logging crews out on the property as of
 
02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday I spoke to some of our
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
Foresters um and while the overall
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
volume of Timber it will will be reduced
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
and has been reduced the type of Timber
 
02:06:54.549 --> 02:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
harvesting that we're doing is more
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
labor intensive um we we're focusing
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
more on what's an individual tree
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
selection we're focusing more on data
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
collection on the front end to make sure
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
we understand what we're
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
harvesting um and so at the end of the
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
day we believe that over time the type
 
02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
of harvesting we're doing will increase
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
the stocking of temp and carbon on the
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
property and it also enhance the growth
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the forest um we we completely
 
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that a healthy Forest is a
 
02:07:32.109 --> 02:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
managed forest and a managed Forest
 
02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
means there's logging occurring and and
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
we intend to continue to do that um I
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
think the the process that we're
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
implementing is more labor intensive on
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
a Timber sale by Timber sale basis so we
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
anticipate you know needing more
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
Foresters more surveyors more
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
Specialists on the ground and so I think
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
long term it's a positive for the
 
02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
property itself um we understand that
 
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
reduced logging volume has a specific
 
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
impact in terms of Timber tax and the
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
majority of the severance tax we pay
 
02:08:16.589 --> 02:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
goes to to the town of Pittsburgh uh we
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
have an agreement in principle
 
02:08:22.589 --> 02:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
with the town to um make up the
 
02:08:26.189 --> 02:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
shortfall in Timber tax
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
revenue that will be generated in the
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year relative to what's
 
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
been generated on average historically
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
so we're we're communicating regularly
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
with the Town Council and working on
 
02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
that for the for the current year um May
 
02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
I interrupt you right there yeah you
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
said that you've been managing maning
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
this property since
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
2013 presumably you've been cutting wood
 
02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:54.549 align:start position:0%
2013 presumably you've been cutting wood
since

02:08:54.549 --> 02:08:54.559 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
2013 has has there been a recent
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
reduction in in the amount of wood
 
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
you're taking from the property there
 
02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
has been yes the the property's been
 
02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
managed under the carbon project since
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
2013 um the the company that owns it now
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
became the owner at the end of 2022
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
through a merger with the forest Land
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
Group and I know the names are probably
 
02:09:23.549 --> 02:09:23.559 align:start position:0%
getting confusing here but I was the
 
02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
president of the forest Land Group so I
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
had a lot of history with the property
 
02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at the Harvest volumes over
 
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
time the Harvest volume before the
 
02:09:37.709 --> 02:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
easement was put in place of
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
2003 um
 
02:09:43.549 --> 02:09:43.559 align:start position:0%
was a good bit higher than what you saw
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
the decade after the easement went in
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
place and since that time there's been a
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
continual decline in the amount of
 
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
property thank you sorry to interrupt
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
you continue no problem uh I I'll
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
conclude with just a few quick comments
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
I mean I want to say with the the
 
02:10:09.549 --> 02:10:09.559 align:start position:0%
strongest possible conviction that we
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
recognize our responsibility as stewards
 
02:10:16.549 --> 02:10:16.559 align:start position:0%
of this remarkable natural resource and
 
02:10:18.549 --> 02:10:18.559 align:start position:0%
we look forward to continuing to work
 
02:10:20.589 --> 02:10:20.599 align:start position:0%
with the local community the state
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislature and public officials to uh
 
02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
ensure the protection of the resource
 
02:10:29.709 --> 02:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
for generations to come H happy to
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
provide additional comments or answer
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee has a
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so I took
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
some notes on what you said and I
 
02:10:42.270 --> 02:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
understand the properties you know been
 
02:10:44.189 --> 02:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
used for and continues to be used for
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
and managed for carbon
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
sequestration um but it it it sounds
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
from your description as though many of
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we heard in the in the
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
North Country legislators who came
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
before us are already being either
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
worked on or have been solved so um can
 
02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
you speak to you said um that there's
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
been a decline I had heard somewhere
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
that the decline in the in the forestry
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
was by about 50% so I don't know can you
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
speak to that can you put a number to
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
how much it's dropped yeah that's
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
correct it it's roughly 50% and and it
 
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
it will vary from year to year based on
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
an approved annual operating plan that
 
02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh gets approved by Forest and lands of
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so but but our long-term
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
expectation when I say long-term over
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
the next 5 to 10 years is roughly a 50%
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
reduction and followup followup and the
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
last note that I made that I wanted to
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
ask you about was you mentioned um that
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're working with the town or local
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
folks to make up the shortfall in the
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
temp tax so I'm curious about that as
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
well um how is that ongoing how how do
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
these folks not how are they not aware
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
that that's being done because it sounds
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
like you're doing all the right things
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to get you know that on the
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
record too if we could yeah the the
 
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
specific process that's occurring there
 
02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
is uh our Forester who's in charge of
 
02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
the property is uh attending the Town
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
Council meetings and he he's an active
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
dialogue and has communicated
 
02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
what we're willing to do and so they're
 
02:12:24.669 --> 02:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
working through formalizing that that
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
plan formalizing addressing the
 
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the timber tax is what
 
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're saying sorry for formalizing
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
making up the gap between what was paid
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
historically in Timber tax and what will
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
be paid in the current fiscal year
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing reduced Harvest
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Kaplan has a
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
question and please Tony speak as close
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
to the mic as you
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll try to make
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
myself Hur I just had a question about
 
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
the original easement that the property
 
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
was under is that still in place in the
 
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
sustainable harvesting of Timber does
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
that accommodate the carbon project that
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
is currently there yes we we yes it does
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
easement still in place the carbon
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
project doesn't impact the easement
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're still living by the absolute
 
02:13:13.870 --> 02:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
letter and spirit of the of the
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
easement the easement you refer to is
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
one that was brokered by Jud Greg and
 
02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
Jean Shaheen back in 2002 is that
 
02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
correct yes sir thank you uh
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative Ms has a question thank
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um thank you for taking
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
my question can you uh talk just a
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
little bit about how the carbon
 
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.390 align:start position:0%
little bit about how the carbon
credits

02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
um uh or what role the carbon credits
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
have in your business model and and and
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
kind and quite frankly what this what
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
the impact of a two-year suspension
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
would be on your business
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um the it it would have an impact
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
on us for sure and and uh it's our
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
primary business to manage the forest
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
that we manage and own to generate
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
carbon credits um we have this uh
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
optimization approach where we're
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
generating revenue from multiple sources
 
02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting carbon credits leasing
 
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
land selling land so it's a it's a
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
for-profit business where we're making
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
decisions as a private land owner using
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
the tools that are available to us um
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
but certainly the focus is on carbon
 
02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:30.310 align:start position:0%
but certainly the focus is on carbon
credit

02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
generation followup followup so what it
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
would a two-year suspension have any
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
impact on you know your your your
 
02:14:39.119 --> 02:14:40.350 align:start position:0%
impact on you know your your your
harvesting

02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
harvesting
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
operations employment
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
Etc so the a 2-year moratorium would
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
just have an impact on the the carbon
 
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
credits were selling we we wouldn't
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
change our management strategy in terms
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing in the in the forest
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
and around harvesting that that would
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
continue but it it would it would be a
 
02:15:01.390 --> 02:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
big hit to
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
revenue if we couldn't sell carbon
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
credits thank
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
you okay I uh said earlier that I was
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to cut this
 
02:15:13.709 --> 02:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
short at
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
11:15 and we have reached that mile
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
Stone so at this point in time I am
 
02:15:24.669 --> 02:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
going to recess this public hearing we
 
02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
will reconvene at a time and date to be
 
02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:32.559 align:start position:0%
determined it will be published in the
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
house calendar and I apologize to all of
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
you for forcing you to come back to do
 
02:15:43.549 --> 02:15:43.559 align:start position:0%
this uh at a different time but I was
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
unaware at the time I scheduled this
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
hearing at what a
 
02:15:52.109 --> 02:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
complicated and convoluted problem that
 
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
this particular bill has
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
introduced and I think it needs thorough
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
explanation from all the different
 
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders many of whom have already
 
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
expressed a desire to
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
speak so in order order to accommodate
 
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
all those stakeholders I think we have
 
02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
to suspend today and come back and do
 
02:16:16.030 --> 02:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
this another time I think I'll schedule
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
it for two hours or maybe three uh when
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
we resume but we're going to have to cut
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
it short for today I think we the
 
02:16:31.469 --> 02:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
relatively or a relative understanding
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
of what the issues are
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
and that will enable us to ask more
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
pertinent questions when we bring you
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
all back uh in a few
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
um a few days or a few weeks whatever
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
whatever the case Mr Mr chairman
 
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
question yes representative bus you have
 
02:16:55.629 --> 02:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
a question um I I completely agree with
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
your your approach the only question I
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
guess I would ask is there anybody that
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
has traveled from out of state that
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify today that we might
 
02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
want to try to
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
accommodate well unfortunately we we
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
just can't accommodate that I I I would
 
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
like I said I apologize to anybody who
 
02:17:16.509 --> 02:17:16.519 align:start position:0%
traveled from out of state or any place
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
else um that that we have to cut this
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
short but we just have no choice I'll
 
02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
accept the responsibility for making the
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
mistake of not scheduling a long enough
 
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing for this complicated
 
02:17:29.469 --> 02:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
question but I didn't realize that it
 
02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
was this complicated so um that's my
 
02:17:35.469 --> 02:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
only defense otherwise I do take
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I'd apologize for the
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
mistake but uh at this time uh I'm going
 
02:17:41.719 --> 02:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
mistake but uh at this time uh I'm going
to

02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh recess this public hearing to a time
 
02:17:49.709 --> 02:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
in date certain which will be published
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%

bills so we'll start our work session by
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
discussing House Bill
 
04:05:26.040 --> 04:05:27.590 align:start position:0%
discussing House Bill
1047

04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
1047
 
04:05:30.030 --> 04:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm passing out to the commit
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee an amendment
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
that representative Thomas Doug Thomas
 
04:05:39.550 --> 04:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
that is has filed
 
04:05:39.560 --> 04:05:40.750 align:start position:0%
that is has filed
to

04:05:40.750 --> 04:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
transform House Bill 1047 from a
 
04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee into a study
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Health and use
 
04:05:53.710 --> 04:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
Services Human Services and the
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.990 --> 04:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
Affairs we suggest that this is a better
 
04:06:02.000 --> 04:06:03.710 align:start position:0%
Affairs we suggest that this is a better
way

04:06:03.710 --> 04:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
to get the data that will be meaningful
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
to potential future legislation to solve
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
this problem and so that is why we are
 
04:06:14.720 --> 04:06:15.990 align:start position:0%
this problem and so that is why we are
suggesting

04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
04:06:20.189 --> 04:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
this uh this amendment so as soon as you
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
get a copy of the amendment I would like
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
everybody to spend a couple of
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
minutes taking a look at it a couple
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
extra copies here if anybody
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh would like
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
them and then we'll have a disc
 
04:06:37.800 --> 04:06:39.550 align:start position:0%
them and then we'll have a disc
discussion

04:06:39.550 --> 04:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:06:39.560 --> 04:06:44.750 align:start position:0%
discussion
about

04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
yep Jim Summers did you put a copy
 
04:06:52.590 --> 04:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
before they have them okay good okay
 
04:06:54.389 --> 04:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
does everybody over here have a copy
 
04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
cren okay I'll give you a couple of
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
seconds to read through this and then
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have a
 
04:07:06.720 --> 04:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
we'll have a
discussion

04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
it's

04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay everybody had a chance to look this
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
over I'd like to hear some comments from
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
people representative McGee what do you
 
04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
think uh thank you Mr chairman I I
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
actually think it's it's a good idea I
 
04:08:03.389 --> 04:08:03.399 align:start position:0%
think that um the agencies that are
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
identified in
 
04:08:07.149 --> 04:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
here may know more you know they may
 
04:08:08.590 --> 04:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
know more
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
off Off the Mark than we do they may you
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
know they may be starting from a better
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
point and they also have uh an interest
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
in doing this and they probably have a
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
better understanding than the
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislative members would have in terms
 
04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
of how to get this done so I actually
 
04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
like the change I think it's
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
good I know representative Muse who was
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor of the bill was a
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
little bit skeptical about whether the
 
04:08:36.189 --> 04:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
Departments the
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
agencies were
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
able to be unbiased about collecting
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
this data but I do think they are the
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
best individuals to collect the data so
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a good a good
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
approach um I'd hear like to hear what
 
04:08:56.229 --> 04:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has to say
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
since he filed the amendment oh I just
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that uh nothing was
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
changed as far as the duties go the the
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
duties remain the same it's just that
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
the the the impus of who does
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
the investigation was shifted to a to
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
State agencies which we think is a
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
better place for it to be otherwise the
 
04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill basically stays the same except for
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
the necessary changes that uh obviously
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
that are not related to being a study
 
04:09:19.760 --> 04:09:21.750 align:start position:0%
that are not related to being a study
committee

04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:09:24.349 --> 04:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
so representative Wendy Thomas as a
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill I'm anxious to
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
hear your thoughts thank you um I
 
04:09:32.830 --> 04:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh like this amendment I think
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
it cuts through the Chase and it it does
 
04:09:37.630 --> 04:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
what most likely would have been a
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the committee anyway
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
so um I'm I'm for this
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
amendment further comments
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you uh the
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
only question I have is now that we're
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
actually directing or now that the
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
amendment would direct state agencies to
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
do something would there be a fiscal
 
04:09:55.279 --> 04:09:59.229 align:start position:0%
do something would there be a fiscal
note

04:09:59.229 --> 04:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
attached I don't know that fiscal notes
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
typically get attached to amendments but
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I suppose it could happen if somebody
 
04:10:08.640 --> 04:10:10.870 align:start position:0%
um I suppose it could happen if somebody
requested

04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
requested
 
04:10:15.269 --> 04:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
it yeah so it'll be up to the
 
04:10:17.790 --> 04:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
um if this bill makes it to the senate
 
04:10:20.349 --> 04:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
in its current form as amended then it
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
would be up to the Departments to chime
 
04:10:24.510 --> 04:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
in at that time and say oh you're going
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
to have to give us more money and more
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
staff to do this otherwise we can't do
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
it so representative cren what do you
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
have to say I guess that was going to be
 
04:10:35.229 --> 04:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
my next question was whether we had
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
contacted either of these departments
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
and asked as them if they were cool with
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
this um or if they would need additional
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh resources to to complete such
 
04:10:47.070 --> 04:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
research we'll find out when it gets to
 
04:10:47.080 --> 04:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
research we'll find out when it gets to
the

04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
Senate further comments representative
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I just make note on this
 
04:10:55.389 --> 04:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
that um even though it's not
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for this uh with getting
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
devices to people you know one of the
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
big reasons I would think that people
 
04:11:03.109 --> 04:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
didn't have computers to hook up to the
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
Internet is they don't have internet
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
access so the New Hampshire has received
 
04:11:09.990 --> 04:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
over 20 over $200 million as part of the
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
internet for all and federal funding and
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
most recently $1 million was given to
 
04:11:17.710 --> 04:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
Grafton County I believe was last week
 
04:11:19.910 --> 04:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
so possibly in that money there may be
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
some thing that be used to look at these
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
things as well because obviously if you
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't have internet uh you're not going
 
04:11:27.070 --> 04:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
to have a computer because you get
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
nothing to connect it to so what
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
department is in charge of that funding
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's not Dees yeah one at a
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
time everybody remember no speaking
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.189 --> 04:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ms has a question or a
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
comment I U I like this approach a lot
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of U you know asking
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
departments to provide a report and um I
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that the language is
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
as representative Doug Thomas said the
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
language is is identical to what was in
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
the original Bill two two two comments
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
though one of the things and this is the
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
maybe the more substantive comment what
 
04:12:08.590 --> 04:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
I took away from some of the testimony
 
04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
we heard and I think it was part of the
 
04:12:12.510 --> 04:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that representative Muse
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
shared with us is that this is a much
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
bigger issue than just computer access
 
04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's an issue about the effectiveness of
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
the of the communication efforts across
 
04:12:26.070 --> 04:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
the board that are being done and I'm
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering whether we want to
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that and maybe change the
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
wording a little bit in terms of the
 
04:12:35.790 --> 04:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
intent so that it doesn't just focus on
 
04:12:37.870 --> 04:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
on people that don't have computer
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
access that's that's the one comment and
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
then the second comment which is more
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
nitpicky um but um you know we've
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
identified the Department of Health and
 
04:12:49.950 --> 04:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services and Department of
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs which
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
probably are the the right two agencies
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
but maybe include some language that
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
says you know that encourages them to
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
reach out to other agencies that they
 
04:13:05.630 --> 04:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
think may be
 
04:13:07.830 --> 04:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
impacted that's in
 
04:13:13.950 --> 04:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:16.189 --> 04:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
idea representative
 
04:13:18.510 --> 04:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
rols thank you Mr chairman well I was
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
largely gonna say I uh appreciate
 
04:13:23.070 --> 04:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
representative Doug
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
Thomas's uh effort here and I like it um
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
but I was going to note that it doesn't
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
mention the department of energy which I
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
thought was U the thrust of a lot of uh
 
04:13:37.870 --> 04:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
while it does say the those two
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
departments are encouraged to reach out
 
04:13:42.109 --> 04:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
to others um I thought there was a lot
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
of I guess in the discussion of this one
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and our colleague representative
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
grassley's Bill there was a lot of uh
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
thought about all the weatherization and
 
04:13:55.389 --> 04:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
those kinds of programs that are
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
Department of energy focused so maybe we
 
04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
might mention them and it it doesn't
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
mention the cap agencies which I thought
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of the might have a lot of
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
the data here I really realiz that the
 
04:14:09.349 --> 04:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's a catchall that they're encouraged
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
to reach out to the others but that's
 
04:14:16.389 --> 04:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
what I noticed any additional
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
comments representative Corman thank you
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to um answer
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's question
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
about the funding in Grafton County and
 
04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
I invite representative bney to correct
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
me if I'm misremembering but uh as I
 
04:14:33.229 --> 04:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
recall that funding is entirely for
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
stringing wires uh to connect the the
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.630 --> 04:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
county go ahead representative
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah yeah I understand that
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
my point was just that if you don't have
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
the wire there or the or the fiber optic
 
04:14:50.870 --> 04:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're not going to buy a device that
 
04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
allows you to get on the internet
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
because you have no way of doing it that
 
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
was my whole point so if we get more
 
04:14:57.550 --> 04:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
internet access to people then maybe
 
04:14:58.830 --> 04:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
they solve their own problem they go out
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
and buy a computer so I think this is
 
04:15:02.229 --> 04:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
intended to be a like bigger picture but
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
just just making note of that that's
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
part of the problem
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
part of the problem
anyways

04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
04:15:10.750 --> 04:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on this
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none let's move on to the
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:23.550 --> 04:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
1230 this is a bill relative
 
04:15:26.750 --> 04:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
to keep all my paperwork straight here
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing a committee to
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
exam examine weatherization ini
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives for homes in New
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:43.349 --> 04:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
the consensus of my caucus was that this
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill should be it for the very reason
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
that as the department of energy
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
testified they have an ongoing
 
04:15:56.670 --> 04:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
weatherization they call it program
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
that's over a decade
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
old uh spins $2 million a year and
 
04:16:05.389 --> 04:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
Deuces to some recent Federal funding is
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
going to increase to about five and a
 
04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
half half million dollar a year over the
 
04:16:10.990 --> 04:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
next five years New Hampshire saves has
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
been in existence for over a
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
decade weatherization is well understood
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
its benefits are well understood its
 
04:16:22.269 --> 04:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
costs are fairly well understood we just
 
04:16:24.030 --> 04:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
can't see any reason
 
04:16:27.389 --> 04:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
why we need a a committee to study
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
weatherization initiatives in New
 
04:16:31.229 --> 04:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I'd be interested in
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
hearing other points of view on this on
 
04:16:34.000 --> 04:16:35.870 align:start position:0%
hearing other points of view on this on
this

04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:40.149 align:start position:0%
this
legislation

04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you um
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
the way that I see this bill I see it
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
linking arms with the with the bill that
 
04:16:49.870 --> 04:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
we just looked at the Communications
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
bill and you know maybe this bill is
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse I mean
 
04:16:57.550 --> 04:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
if we can establish where their
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
communication leaks or or drops in New
 
04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um then once that's
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
established we can figure out how to
 
04:17:09.269 --> 04:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:12.269 --> 04:17:12.279 align:start position:0%
so well I remember from yesterday's
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing I asked the department of
 
04:17:16.990 --> 04:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
energy if they could comment on the
 
04:17:20.269 --> 04:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
$400,000 in yearly funds that are
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
allocated to the department to
 
04:17:24.910 --> 04:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
promulgate the benefits of Energy
 
04:17:28.030 --> 04:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and Mr Roberge at the time
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
said that he would have to get back to
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
us on that because he didn't have
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
details on the program but I would
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
remind members that that program which
 
04:17:40.590 --> 04:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
is is not insignificant is designed to
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
do exactly the kind of communications
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
Outreach that this bill and the previous
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
with okay any further comment
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you um I I
 
04:18:00.109 --> 04:18:00.119 align:start position:0%
actually intend to vote for the bill I
 
04:18:01.710 --> 04:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
don't love the bill but I intend to vote
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
for the bill um in large part because I
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
do work with a local nonprofit in the
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley and a big part of our focus
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
is weatherization and I want to promote
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
that but also the bill uh does contain
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh a degree of measuring and I think
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's good to to be able to measure what
 
04:18:18.800 --> 04:18:20.990 align:start position:0%
it's good to to be able to measure what
we're

04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:18:23.790 --> 04:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
doing okay thank you for your
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
perspective other
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
04:18:32.189 --> 04:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
ner we have way too many studies as it
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
is and I don't want to vote to add to
 
04:18:34.720 --> 04:18:35.710 align:start position:0%
is and I don't want to vote to add to
that

04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:35.720 --> 04:18:37.389 align:start position:0%
that
list

04:18:37.389 --> 04:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
well it is well known that study
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
committees particularly in the second
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
year of a bium are under some extreme
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
time pressure because they their work
 
04:18:48.870 --> 04:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
has to be done before the members of the
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
committee leave office potentially at
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
the end of um the second year of the
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
bium that is a that is a
 
04:19:01.870 --> 04:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
perennial problem with second year study
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
committees representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um just because we're in
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
the second year of the term doesn't mean
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be doing good work if
 
04:19:14.590 --> 04:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.630 --> 04:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
for I agree the question is can we do
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
good work when we're under such
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
significant time
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
pressure uh as you well recall
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
frequently bills that we pass out of the
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate don't reach the
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
governor's desk until June
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
July they can be signed into law and
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
then the speaker's office has to appoint
 
04:19:42.030 --> 04:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
members of the study committee it can be
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
September or October before a study
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
committee even convenes and I know this
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
for a fact because I've been on a couple
 
04:19:51.429 --> 04:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
of study committees that were appointed
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
in September or October and had
 
04:19:58.590 --> 04:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
to run like mad to get a report out by
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
November 1st so no I understand that and
 
04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it but if we're going to
 
04:20:05.309 --> 04:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
make a joint decision um and vote
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
against all study committee
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
bills then why are we even accepting any
 
04:20:13.030 --> 04:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
year Well if they're filed you have to
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
accept them I don't think you can reject
 
04:20:17.359 --> 04:20:19.710 align:start position:0%
accept them I don't think you can reject
them

04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
so representative n do we know if the
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
Senate is accepting them I know like um
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
if we in previous years we've um passed
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
resolutions and they won't even look at
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
them the Senate has a very negative
 
04:20:36.070 --> 04:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
attitude toward study committee bills
 
04:20:36.080 --> 04:20:37.269 align:start position:0%
attitude toward study committee bills
and

04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
they did um itl several of the study
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
committee bills that we passed last year
 
04:20:46.269 --> 04:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
they did accept a few however so it's
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
04:20:51.870 --> 04:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
uniform um position on the part of the
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
senate representative n one last comment
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
and any representative that wants to
 
04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
learn more about anything they can go to
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
legislative research and there's a paid
 
04:21:07.389 --> 04:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
staff who can do the research for you
 
04:21:09.550 --> 04:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's true that's very
 
04:21:12.910 --> 04:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
true additional
 
04:21:16.229 --> 04:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none we'll move on to
 
04:21:17.469 --> 04:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
the next
 
04:21:22.109 --> 04:21:22.119 align:start position:0%
bill which is House Bill 1289
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study the
 
04:21:26.670 --> 04:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
replacement of the peer plant in bow
 
04:21:29.070 --> 04:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
with a clean energy based load generator
 
04:21:29.080 --> 04:21:30.590 align:start position:0%
with a clean energy based load generator
and

04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:33.109 --> 04:21:33.119 align:start position:0%
storage my caucus feels that this is a
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned build but it is just
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
not workable simply because a study
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
commission can't tell a private business
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
what it can or cannot do with regard to
 
04:21:50.910 --> 04:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
an energy plant so um that itl would be
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
our preferred um action on this bill
 
04:21:56.590 --> 04:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I was just going to
 
04:22:00.269 --> 04:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
say our my caucus has the exact same
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
opinion that the bill is well
 
04:22:04.429 --> 04:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
intentioned but that it isn't workable
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
so representative Harrington
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
no need to add anything more oh
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have anything to add
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
one looks like uh we're all in agreement
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
on this one so hb1 1499 would be next
 
04:22:25.710 --> 04:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
and this would
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
establish a
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
um a committee to study the civilian
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
clean energy Community resilience and
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
conservation core
 
04:22:40.830 --> 04:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
and during the course of the public
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on this
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
bill I asked the prime sponsor if he had
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
um given any consideration to cost
 
04:22:51.520 --> 04:22:52.670 align:start position:0%
um given any consideration to cost
benefit

04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:22:55.109 --> 04:22:55.119 align:start position:0%
analysis and he said
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
no and so I have prepared an amendment
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
to address what I think is a shortcoming
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the bill and we'll pass that out to
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:08.349 align:start position:0%
of the bill and we'll pass that out to
everyone

04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment does basically is
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
it just adds a new section
 
04:23:18.269 --> 04:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
two under
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
duties which requires the committee to
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
perform and publish rigorous cost
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
benefit analyses of all programs and
 
04:23:28.750 --> 04:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
then describes a couple of different
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:37.750 --> 04:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
use representative Thomas's name is
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
first on this
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
amendment which is an OSS error
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
because I was the one who um created the
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
amendment but it doesn't matter comes
 
04:23:51.070 --> 04:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
from our caucus so doesn't have the
 
04:23:53.309 --> 04:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
water ma unapproved
 
04:23:58.030 --> 04:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
either oh yeah interesting happens now
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have the unapproved watermark
 
04:24:04.429 --> 04:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
on it like like most uh amendments do I
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what that means um
 
04:24:11.710 --> 04:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
another change is on line 22 section 4
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
seek Partnerships with there was already
 
04:24:18.349 --> 04:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of entities mentioned and we uh
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
added a bunch more clean energy New
 
04:24:22.030 --> 04:24:22.040 align:start position:0%

04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%

with State business economic
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
interests which may be redundant based
 
04:25:00.910 --> 04:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
on representative wilhelm's testimony
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um leg Federal legislation that
 
04:25:05.520 --> 04:25:07.189 align:start position:0%
um leg Federal legislation that
authorized

04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
04:25:10.990 --> 04:25:11.000 align:start position:0%

04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
Umbrella of that legislation to
 
04:25:19.630 --> 04:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
interfere with Economic and Business
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
interests but u i felt it was worthwhile
 
04:25:27.070 --> 04:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
to restate that in in this
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
legislation so comments on the
 
04:25:33.550 --> 04:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Ms um more of
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
a more of a question the um
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know the items that you included in
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
the new section to the cost benefit
 
04:25:43.149 --> 04:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
ratio and the cost Effectiveness
 
04:25:43.159 --> 04:25:45.109 align:start position:0%
ratio and the cost Effectiveness
analysis

04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
um those those would be done on a on a
 
04:25:54.149 --> 04:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
kind of um projected basis correct
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
because all that we're proposing here
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
all that the bill proposes is to put
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
together a plan on how we might
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
implement this kind of program there
 
04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
won't be any actual costs or benefits to
 
04:26:11.950 --> 04:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.389 --> 04:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
calculation well if you propose a
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
program and you determine that the
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
program presents
 
04:26:23.550 --> 04:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
benefits isn't it incumbent upon you to
 
04:26:23.560 --> 04:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
benefits isn't it incumbent upon you to
also

04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
calculate what the delivery of those
 
04:26:30.189 --> 04:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
benefits will cost that's the essence of
 
04:26:32.109 --> 04:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
a cost benefit analysis no I I agree
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
with you I just want to make sure that
 
04:26:35.229 --> 04:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
we're all clear that what we're talking
 
04:26:36.510 --> 04:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
about are project
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
benef costs and benefit yes of course
 
04:26:39.080 --> 04:26:40.109 align:start position:0%
benef costs and benefit yes of course
yes

04:26:40.109 --> 04:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:26:42.389 --> 04:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
okay there was one other change that I
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
forgot to mention on line four number
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
one the very first word in the original
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
04:26:52.830 --> 04:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
shape and I changed that to Define
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
because I I couldn't understand exactly
 
04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
what shape meant so I thought Define was
 
04:27:01.790 --> 04:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
a was a better a choice of words
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you um
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
on page one lines 22 through 24 where
 
04:27:10.030 --> 04:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
you identify the groups that they should
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
seek Partnerships with you're not
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
implying that those are the only groups
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
there yes I I never meant to uh exclude
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
any any other proposed organizations um
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
I just thought that those since those
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
are organizations that we hear from
 
04:27:36.870 --> 04:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
Fairly regularly in this committee would
 
04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
be yeah I understand that but the way
 
04:27:40.590 --> 04:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
it's written it looks like those are the
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
only organizations they can link arms
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
with it it does sort of look that way
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we can address that um thank
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
you shortcoming in the senate
 
04:27:55.870 --> 04:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative Corman yeah thank you um
 
04:27:57.790 --> 04:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
so one one suggestion would be just say
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
Seek Partnerships with organizations
 
04:28:03.070 --> 04:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
such as and then that list uh but I had
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
another question which is um so in lines
 
04:28:10.030 --> 04:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
12 through 19 there are listed two
 
04:28:12.429 --> 04:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
specific methodologies and I'm just
 
04:28:16.349 --> 04:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
wondering why two specific methodologies
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
need to be included in the bill when
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
examples because it would be too long to
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
include a list of all of the uh cost
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
benefit analyses I did a um a
 
04:28:36.870 --> 04:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
preliminary SE Arch and found 10
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
different methodologies that you could
 
04:28:40.990 --> 04:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
use to do a cost benefit analysis and I
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
chose the two that I thought would be
 
04:28:47.550 --> 04:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
most appropriate for this particular
 
04:28:51.269 --> 04:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
Target um if if I may um but so then
 
04:28:54.670 --> 04:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
you're not excluding some other accepted
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
methodology are you you're not reing one
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
of these two says using an accepted
 
04:29:04.349 --> 04:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
methodology for example so it doesn't
 
04:29:06.910 --> 04:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
preclude others no right so I'm just
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
wondering can could could we just end
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:24.030 --> 04:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
then someone would inevitably raise the
 
04:29:29.510 --> 04:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
question well what kind of methodology
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
are you're talking about so I put a
 
04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
couple in here to give examples so
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
people would know just exactly what
 
04:29:39.309 --> 04:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:41.950 --> 04:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
about more information is better than
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
than less
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
right partial information can be more
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
damaging than than none I mean I'm I'm
 
04:29:50.109 --> 04:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
not against these two please please
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
understand I'm just thinking you know as
 
04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
a word Smith here just where where we
 
04:29:56.590 --> 04:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
list two and you said there are 10 that
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
that could be used so you know these two
 
04:30:02.590 --> 04:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
were chosen
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
um it it it seems to me
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
like either you list them all or none
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
that that's the way I would do it well
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
as I look through the list of 10 there
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
were some that were I didn't think yeah
 
04:30:20.349 --> 04:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate at all for this kind of a
 
04:30:23.309 --> 04:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis so I chose the two
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I felt were were the were the best
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
fit and use them as examples but
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
not in a prescriptive way I didn't write
 
04:30:36.030 --> 04:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
the language to say you have to use
 
04:30:36.040 --> 04:30:37.670 align:start position:0%
the language to say you have to use
these

04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:30:40.269 --> 04:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
two representative McGee I would like to
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
join this conversation
 
04:30:46.990 --> 04:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I I'm coming back to two things
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
um first representative muns mentioned
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that these would be projected
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
cost benefit ratios or projected cost
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
effective analyses because they can't
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
know in advance of running the program
 
04:31:03.550 --> 04:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
what the actuals would be so it will be
 
04:31:06.269 --> 04:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
predicated on assumptions
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
and um and often times cost benefit
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
analysis will have quite a bit of
 
04:31:15.070 --> 04:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
assumption um used in in making um the
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis so what I see here
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
though is you're defining each of these
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
even though those definitions are
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
readily available and then also adding
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
the goal shall be to identify the most
 
04:31:28.349 --> 04:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
cost-effective option for achieving a
 
04:31:28.359 --> 04:31:29.469 align:start position:0%
cost-effective option for achieving a
particular

04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:31:32.910 --> 04:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
objective and I don't think that this
 
04:31:34.990 --> 04:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill lends itself to that this is not
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
the same as is running running a program
 
04:31:40.109 --> 04:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
where it would be investment of State
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
dollars for a particular outcome like
 
04:31:44.349 --> 04:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
weather Rising houses or whatever that
 
04:31:46.830 --> 04:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
could be Quantified and I think the
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had um
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday went into sort of
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
the the generative benefits of
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
having programs that are young people
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
could participate in and the advantage
 
04:32:03.389 --> 04:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
of getting them very hard to quantify
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
things like job experience and uh
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
camaraderie and whatever so I'm not I'm
 
04:32:11.710 --> 04:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
not sure that um this much definition
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be put here in cost benefit
 
04:32:15.309 --> 04:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
because there's no fiscal note on this
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill there's no money being put in that
 
04:32:20.189 --> 04:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
we have to account for so I just think
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
it might be Superfluous or you could
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
list it as um my colleague uh
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative Corman mentioned which is
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
end at the comma after
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
methodology and then say for example
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
cost benefit
 
04:32:38.590 --> 04:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
Ratio or cost Effectiveness analysis and
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to put all the other
 
04:32:41.109 --> 04:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
stuff in there so that people are at
 
04:32:43.149 --> 04:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
least keeping it in mind but I'm not
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
sure what we gain from that like either
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask them to pursue it so
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
we can see how it works out or we're not
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
because we to spend anything so that
 
04:32:55.109 --> 04:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
sentence that you referen the goal shall
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
be to identify blah blah blah that
 
04:33:00.189 --> 04:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
sentence applies specifically to the
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
costeffective analysis it's part of the
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
description of that analysis it does
 
04:33:08.590 --> 04:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the goal of all of the
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analyses should be to
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
identify the most cost effective option
 
04:33:15.750 --> 04:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
let me let me put it this way it does it
 
04:33:17.230 --> 04:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
make it too burdensome for the people
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
who are trying to implement is the would
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
be the question does it make it
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
burdensome because these are examples so
 
04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see that it creates any kind of
 
04:33:28.109 --> 04:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
a burden for the implementor because
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
they could choose a completely different
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
methodology if they
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
wanted I just thought it was it would be
 
04:33:36.629 --> 04:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
useful MH to to prevent people from
 
04:33:38.670 --> 04:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
wondering well what kind of a
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
methodology should I use to to cite a
 
04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.029 --> 04:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
examples well can I can I suggest that
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
we add projected in front of A and B
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
under examples because they wouldn't be
 
04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
actual so insert the word projected
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
where before benefit cost ratio and cost
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.429 --> 04:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
analysis so using an accepted
 
04:34:14.590 --> 04:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
example how about if we put the word
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
projected perform and
 
04:34:18.600 --> 04:34:20.869 align:start position:0%
projected perform and
publish

04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
publish
 
04:34:23.629 --> 04:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
rigorous projected cost benefit proed
 
04:34:23.639 --> 04:34:25.189 align:start position:0%
rigorous projected cost benefit proed
cost

04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.269 --> 04:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
that to do this right away H us to do
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
yep chrisy head going to give you a
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
heads up we're going to be asking you to
 
04:34:46.269 --> 04:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
take uh some changes to
 
04:34:49.869 --> 04:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
OS and try to get them accomplished as
 
04:34:52.949 --> 04:34:52.959 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible I'll let you take my
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
copy so you you'll you'll have all
 
04:34:59.070 --> 04:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
the yeah and you could also mention to
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.199 --> 04:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
watermarked

04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:15.789 --> 04:35:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.390 --> 04:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
okay Su representative
 
04:35:21.869 --> 04:35:21.879 align:start position:0%
muns I I you know I was just going to
 
04:35:24.510 --> 04:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
suggest that you know if rather than
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
maybe identifying the two specific
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
examples just use some wording like you
 
04:35:32.109 --> 04:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
know wellestablished generally accepted
 
04:35:34.510 --> 04:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis approaches I mean
 
04:35:37.150 --> 04:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many many and rather
 
04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:39.799 align:start position:0%
than confuse the issue by somehow
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
pointing them to these two when we
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
really don't
 
04:35:46.349 --> 04:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
care that's just
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chair um due to the
 
04:35:55.029 --> 04:35:55.039 align:start position:0%
complexity of the discussion here and
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
looking at it the fact that it
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
establishes a study committee would this
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
not follow into the same Paradox at the
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
three prior bills before creating a
 
04:36:07.590 --> 04:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
study committee for the this short
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
term yeah it It suffers from the same
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
problem and we discussed that in the
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing yesterday sorry you uh
 
04:36:17.949 --> 04:36:17.959 align:start position:0%
couldn't couldn't join us but um it is a
 
04:36:20.109 --> 04:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
pretty tight window
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
to to come up with a report on this
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
study committee by the 1st of November
 
04:36:30.269 --> 04:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
2024 but representative willhelm who was
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor of the bill said he
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
thought it was doable so that's why
 
04:36:40.109 --> 04:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
we we thought that it would it would
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
probably be okay to go forward with this
 
04:36:44.109 --> 04:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
particular study
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
committee representative Corman thank
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
you uh I have a question uh for you
 
04:36:53.310 --> 04:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
about the intent of the cost benefit
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
analysis um so I'm I'm thinking in
 
04:36:58.109 --> 04:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
particular about the line the goal shall
 
04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
be to identify the most costeffective
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
option for achieving a particular
 
04:37:05.349 --> 04:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
objective and I understand that that is
 
04:37:08.230 --> 04:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
to the ca methodology but just in terms
 
04:37:10.429 --> 04:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
of your intent I'm imagining let's say
 
04:37:14.029 --> 04:37:14.039 align:start position:0%
there were two Alternatives A and B um a
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
has a higher or better cost benefit
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
analysis but only by a little bit uh but
 
04:37:22.349 --> 04:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
B has other
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
advantages would is your intent that you
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
would base something only on the cost
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis or you would factor
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
that in with the other advantages that a
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
program might have and I'm asking this
 
04:37:35.869 --> 04:37:35.879 align:start position:0%
because you know people often ask well
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
what was the intent of the legislation
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I just want to understand your
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
intent so this is a study committee and
 
04:37:49.070 --> 04:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
this is a task for the committee to
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.400 --> 04:37:58.189 align:start position:0%
 
duties

04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
therefore the goal of this task is to
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that they do a cost benefit
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:05.789 align:start position:0%
make sure that they do a cost benefit
analysis

04:38:05.789 --> 04:38:05.799 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's one thing as I mentioned a few
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
minutes ago to list all the benefits of
 
04:38:09.600 --> 04:38:10.590 align:start position:0%
minutes ago to list all the benefits of
doing

04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
something but if you exclude the costs
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
then how can you make a rational
 
04:38:15.240 --> 04:38:16.789 align:start position:0%
then how can you make a rational
decision

04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
about what option to choose so the goal
 
04:38:24.830 --> 04:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
of this duty is to get them to do some
 
04:38:27.029 --> 04:38:27.039 align:start position:0%
kind of rational cost benefit analysis
 
04:38:28.629 --> 04:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
on the options they're
 
04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
considering simple as that right so so
 
04:38:35.230 --> 04:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
I'm that I understood and I think that
 
04:38:37.390 --> 04:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense uh the the question
 
04:38:41.470 --> 04:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
really was would that be the the only
 
04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
Criterion that that should be used to
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
decide about a program or would there be
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
other criteria taken into account as
 
04:38:51.869 --> 04:38:51.879 align:start position:0%
well well under duties there's a whole
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
list of things that the study committee
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
should be evaluating as it tries to
 
04:39:00.629 --> 04:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
develop a plan for one of these programs
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm just saying that a cost benefit
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
final thought representative McGee his
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
his comment brought up this thought so
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
having these descriptions here these are
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
the general descriptions for benefit
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
cost ratio and cost Effectiveness
 
04:39:26.230 --> 04:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
analysis and so they are based on uh
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
general principles around determining
 
04:39:29.480 --> 04:39:30.470 align:start position:0%
general principles around determining
cost

04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness the number two item says
 
04:39:34.990 --> 04:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
perform and publish and I'll say a
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
projected cost benefit analysis of all
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
programs using an accepted methodology
 
04:39:42.510 --> 04:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
when you put these particulars in here I
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
think it may
 
04:39:46.788 --> 04:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
modify uh the committee's thoughts
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
around what it is their their their
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
required um to return when it's
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
prospective right this bill is they're
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
not going to have anything much real to
 
04:40:01.990 --> 04:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
work with so I just I don't think we
 
04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
should spend time trying to identify um
 
04:40:07.628 --> 04:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
the detailed language that comes after
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
these definitions because I think it's
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
it convolutes the issue more I think if
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
you just left number two saying perform
 
04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
and publish a a projected cost benefit
 
04:40:17.788 --> 04:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
analysis of all programs using an accept
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
using accepted methodologies that that
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient I don't I don't
 
04:40:24.390 --> 04:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
think I think the other language just um
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
May confuse folks as to what they have
 
04:40:29.910 --> 04:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
to achieve to meet it since it's going
 
04:40:29.920 --> 04:40:32.910 align:start position:0%
to achieve to meet it since it's going
in

04:40:32.910 --> 04:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
law I'm having trouble understanding
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
what's offensive about a couple of
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
examples well the BCR greater than one
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
indicates the benefits exceed the costs
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
and to representative corman's point in
 
04:40:47.070 --> 04:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
some cases the benefits will not be
 
04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
quantifiable in terms of a number and so
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the eye of the beholder and it
 
04:40:52.750 --> 04:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
just makes it a little harder for a
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.470 --> 04:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
BCR methodology correctly I think that
 
04:41:06.110 --> 04:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
it would come out out the way you
 
04:41:08.910 --> 04:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
want if BCR turned out to be greater
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
okay I think the fewer changes we ask OS
 
04:41:21.310 --> 04:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
to make at this point in time the better
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
off we're going to be because it's now
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
quarter of
 
04:41:24.240 --> 04:41:27.390 align:start position:0%
quarter of
two

04:41:27.390 --> 04:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.150 --> 04:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
so Christy could you come and get this
 
04:41:34.750 --> 04:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh and take it to OS please and ask them
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
to make two changes ask them to make add
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
the word projected after rigorous in on
 
04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
line 10 and ask them to change online 22
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
insert the the the phrase organizations
 
04:41:49.760 --> 04:41:51.430 align:start position:0%
insert the the the phrase organizations
such

04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
such
 
04:41:55.788 --> 04:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
as okay and the uh Watermark or whatever
 
04:41:55.798 --> 04:41:58.510 align:start position:0%
as okay and the uh Watermark or whatever
it's

04:41:58.510 --> 04:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:58.520 --> 04:42:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
called

04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:42:08.670 --> 04:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
98 as I indicated in my testimony
 
04:42:18.030 --> 04:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday I have authored an
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to this
 
04:42:25.788 --> 04:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
bill which removes section one of the
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill and changes the wording of the
 
04:42:33.070 --> 04:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
section in section two of the bill it
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
also changes
 
04:42:37.628 --> 04:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
um section two of the bill to to now
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:47.070 --> 04:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
bill so basically this amendment
 
04:42:50.310 --> 04:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire Bill and as you can
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
see shortens it by well over
 
04:42:57.788 --> 04:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
half so now the bill has just one
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
section except for the effective date
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
section that's that's section number
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:05.110 align:start position:0%
section that's that's section number
two

04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
and that just says that we insert a new
 
04:43:15.550 --> 04:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph 7A after paragraph 7 in RSA
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
362a colon 9 that reads distribution
 
04:43:21.628 --> 04:43:21.638 align:start position:0%
utilities shall recover costs associated
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
with net metering and group hosting
 
04:43:25.550 --> 04:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
through a stranded cost recovery charge
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
or other non bypassable charges approved
 
04:43:30.190 --> 04:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
by the commission as long as those
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
charges are displayed on customer bills
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
that's the same wording that that I
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
offered in my written testimony
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday when I introduced this bill
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
and so we would be my caucus will offer
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment to
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
1398 and a motion of ought to pass as
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
amended so comments on this
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
amendment so Mr
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um so you're suggesting that
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
after section section s there now be a
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
section 7 a so it's distinct it doesn't
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
replace anything correct okay it's a new
 
04:44:09.240 --> 04:44:14.230 align:start position:0%
replace anything correct okay it's a new
section

04:44:14.230 --> 04:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments on
 
04:44:19.750 --> 04:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
this proposed
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
04:44:24.510 --> 04:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
nter I appreciate that it's shorten to
 
04:44:24.520 --> 04:44:26.590 align:start position:0%
nter I appreciate that it's shorten to
the

04:44:26.590 --> 04:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:36.830 --> 04:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
good um representative McGee yep um I
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
thought when we spoke
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
earlier the amendment was going to not
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
use stranded recovery cost charge but
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
was going to use the same nomenclature
 
04:44:51.150 --> 04:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
as unitel was using I have it written
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
down somewhere in my notes but didn't
 
04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
you say it was going to be called the
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
same thing in in order to eliminate it
 
04:45:00.510 --> 04:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
from being construed as a stranded cost
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
which was kind of the sticking point so
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
the phrase or other non- bypassable
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
charge as approved by the commission
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
means it could be an extra external
 
04:45:15.390 --> 04:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
Unitil and the only sort
 
04:45:18.240 --> 04:45:20.628 align:start position:0%
Unitil and the only sort
of

04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh policy change would be that this
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
language would require that that charge
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
would be displayed on customer bills
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
which it currently is not so for Unitil
 
04:45:36.910 --> 04:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
this would require adding their external
 
04:45:40.270 --> 04:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
distribution charge as a listing on the
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill I I would prefer honestly if we're
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
going to get it right I would prefer if
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
the sentence said distributed utilities
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
shall recover costs associated with net
 
04:45:54.510 --> 04:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
metering and group hosting through a non
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
bypassable charge rather than mentioning
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
as long as the charge is displayed on
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
customer bills
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes because I think even ever Source uh
 
04:46:14.868 --> 04:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
testified to the fact that it would be
 
04:46:17.550 --> 04:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
confusing to construe these charges
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
which are associated with rates in the
 
04:46:22.110 --> 04:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
in the stranded recovery section of the
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
testimony too bad we already sent chrisy
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
off to
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh true we have other work to do she can
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
suppose any other comments on this while
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
I think about that
 
04:46:46.830 --> 04:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
um Mr
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
04:46:53.110 --> 04:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
bernardy so I believe the the discussion
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
for including it in the stranded cost
 
04:46:59.190 --> 04:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
line along with other stranded
 
04:47:04.190 --> 04:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
cost was was to because it's already
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
line on the bills that exist and
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
therefore one would not be requiring a
 
04:47:16.030 --> 04:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
new line to be printed uh on bills and
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
re incur the cost of of correcting a a
 
04:47:23.788 --> 04:47:23.798 align:start position:0%
bill template
 
04:47:23.798 --> 04:47:27.590 align:start position:0%
bill template
um

04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.990 --> 04:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
so the other virtue of putting it in
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
that place
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
was then it was a common place where
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
everyone who is interested in it could
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
say in my stranded costs what
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
are the net metering charges what are
 
04:47:49.590 --> 04:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
the uh costs associated with whatever
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.070 --> 04:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
so so representative
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
McGee how would you like this
 
04:48:02.590 --> 04:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
language distribution utility shall
 
04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
recover cost associated with net group
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
hosting through a non bypassable charge
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
such as stranded cost recovery Char such
 
04:48:14.590 --> 04:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
as a stranded cost recovery charge as
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
approved by the commissioner as long as
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
those charges are displayed on the
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
bills again I think they have the option
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
whichever and I'm rattling
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
off um I I I still believe that rather
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
than giving them stranded cost recovery
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
charge in in what we're changing we
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
should say through a non- bypassable
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
charge which the stranded recovery cost
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
is a subset of a non- bypassable charge
 
04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
and that way it leaves the option open
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
rather than leading them there because
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
we did have testimony that it would be
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
confusing if that was if that was where
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
we put it that and that was eversource
 
04:49:02.350 --> 04:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think I don't think we
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
should be leading them there
 
04:49:06.150 --> 04:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
um and they still have the option
 
04:49:08.430 --> 04:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
certainly uh we did get testimony that
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
right now the stranded recovery costs
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
are um where they're putting that so
 
04:49:18.548 --> 04:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
that to to your point JD right that
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
right right oh you're here I don't want
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
but did he move
 
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
up is the way are you dying to join this
 
04:49:36.270 --> 04:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
anyway that that's my point I I'm not
 
04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure we need that language
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
in here in order to um to cover what it
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
is we're trying to cover with the Pu
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
because they know what the non-
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
bypassable charges are and they know
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
which ones are appropriate without us
 
04:49:51.638 --> 04:49:54.868 align:start position:0%
which ones are appropriate without us
defining

04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
it well to be honest with you I'm I
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
really don't object to taking that
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge language
 
04:50:07.548 --> 04:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
out through
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.230 --> 04:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
charge as approved by the commission as
 
04:50:16.990 --> 04:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
long as those charges are displayed on
 
04:50:17.000 --> 04:50:20.070 align:start position:0%
long as those charges are displayed on
customer

04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.470 --> 04:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
bills so we can make it even shorter and
 
04:50:25.628 --> 04:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
briefer which would make representative
 
04:50:28.350 --> 04:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
nter happy to everyone
 
04:50:32.430 --> 04:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
suarin all right as soon as christe gets
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
back or she we have one of us go over
 
04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you uh I have to say that
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
even if if it's shorter I'm I'm not in
 
04:50:48.510 --> 04:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill for a couple of
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
reasons one is that things are fluid
 
04:50:53.470 --> 04:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
right now and we have an open docket at
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
the puc about net metering and things
 
04:50:57.310 --> 04:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
04:51:00.548 --> 04:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
changing and uh there's still nothing
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
about the advantages of net metering
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
that would be appearing on a customer
 
04:51:06.000 --> 04:51:07.750 align:start position:0%
that would be appearing on a customer
bill

04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:51:12.030 --> 04:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
um plus all the concerns raised by uh Mr
 
04:51:16.510 --> 04:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
Belo um many of which um were confusing
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
but uh you know and remain to be
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
understood but but you know he he
 
04:51:23.390 --> 04:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
clearly had some some real concerns
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
about how this would affect Community
 
04:51:28.350 --> 04:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
power and other aggregators so um even
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
with the change I I won't be voting for
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
this okay that's perfectly fine
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
04:51:37.548 --> 04:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
um I I have a question and um forgive me
 
04:51:39.548 --> 04:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
if I should know the answer but we you
 
04:51:43.628 --> 04:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
know is if if this bill if if this bill
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
passes and we add this language to
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
statute is that going would would that
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
be the first time in statute that we are
 
04:51:54.910 --> 04:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
saying that net metering may be
 
04:51:59.788 --> 04:51:59.798 align:start position:0%
recovered through a non- bypassable
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
charge the first time in Statute in
 
04:52:04.548 --> 04:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
statute I know the Pu has said that we
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
can do it but would this be the first
 
04:52:09.628 --> 04:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
reference in statute to making it a non-
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
bypassable charge that be a good
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
question for OS research I was hoping
 
04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
that maybe Mr Lata could give us some
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
insight or putting him on the spot yet
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
Roberge that's what maybe we can get an
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
answer to that before before the after
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
is over that that to me is a is a would
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
be a big concern so representative
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
Bernard has a comment yeah I'm it's my
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
belief that this is just a transparency
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
issue this is not not uh um making any
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
comment whether a charge is recoverable
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
or not recoverable the the the uh the
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
costs exist the charges exist it's just
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
a transparency issue of making sure it's
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
captured and available for
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
understanding representative Thomas Doug
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a thank you Mr chair I just
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
want to say that um uh I'm I'm not
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
entirely coni I'm not sure if Mr
 
04:53:19.190 --> 04:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
bow accurately addressed the bill to his
 
04:53:21.548 --> 04:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
concerns as far as what this bill is
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
really doing so I'm I'm not sure I I can
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
agree with uh with much of what he said
 
04:53:28.590 --> 04:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
regarding what he thought this bill
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
would do I think this is a transparency
 
04:53:33.628 --> 04:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
issue um I think it makes the bill
 
04:53:37.868 --> 04:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
better and um I can I I can support the
 
04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill by supporting this amendment which
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think makes the bill
 
04:53:46.430 --> 04:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
better thank you uh representative rolds
 
04:53:48.190 --> 04:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
has a
 
04:53:51.270 --> 04:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chairman I um I
 
04:53:54.190 --> 04:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you were willing to uh
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
accept R representative McGee's um
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we delete reference to
 
04:54:02.480 --> 04:54:05.510 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we delete reference to
uh

04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
labeling net metering
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
costs stranded costs because I think
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
that's that would be entirely
 
04:54:18.190 --> 04:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
inappropriate net metering costs do not
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
fit the definition of stranded costs so
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we we got that far but I I
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh object to the continued
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
characterization of this bill as a
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
transparency bill when uh what it would
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
do is it would it seems to me that it it
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
kind of is is another volley in our
 
04:54:45.070 --> 04:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing you know battle over the
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
discussion of the costs and benefits of
 
04:54:48.040 --> 04:54:48.750 align:start position:0%
discussion of the costs and benefits of
net

04:54:48.750 --> 04:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
net
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
metering of which you know we talked we
 
04:54:54.270 --> 04:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
discussed yesterday about the deer study
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
multi-year study about the costs and
 
04:54:58.590 --> 04:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
benefits of net metering and in this
 
04:55:01.150 --> 04:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
bill you are attempting kind of an end
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
naming the costs of net metering as a
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
cost and remaining silent on the
 
04:55:15.270 --> 04:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
benefits of net metering and now we're
 
04:55:17.590 --> 04:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to put a number on customers bills
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
that tell them that there is this cost
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
to net metering while remaining silent
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
about the benefits of net metering and
 
04:55:27.750 --> 04:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
we had testimony yesterday that that
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
said as much um by being
 
04:55:34.230 --> 04:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
one-sided uh it's not not transparent
 
04:55:38.310 --> 04:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's actually muddling the issue so I
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
object to uh the amendment and the bill
 
04:55:43.590 --> 04:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
and won certainly won't be voting for it
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki okay just uh I
 
04:55:48.270 --> 04:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
think that there is a parallel between
 
04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
this and the uh decades old construction
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
work in prog uh line on the uh utility
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
bills which brought the attention of the
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
rate payers to the fact that uh they
 
04:56:00.750 --> 04:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
were paying for something and were not
 
04:56:02.590 --> 04:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
getting an immediate benefit so there's
 
04:56:04.350 --> 04:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
a lot I think there's a parallel I think
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:10.830 --> 04:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
precedent representative
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
migie well I must apologize because I am
 
04:56:17.190 --> 04:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
getting old but I did actually watch the
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
hearing I rewatched some of Clifton
 
04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
belo's testimony as well and um because
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
I had nothing better to do this morning
 
04:56:29.110 --> 04:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
and uh my memory has been jogged by the
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
stuff that other folks are saying and
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was of concern is
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
that what this enables is not simply an
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
effort at transparency but also to sort
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
of enshrine the ability for net metering
 
04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
costs to be recovered for utilities but
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't offer that same um uh
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
security to anybody else that's
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
operating in the competitive markets and
 
04:56:56.430 --> 04:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
therefore it puts those
 
04:56:59.788 --> 04:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
competitive uh generate suppliers at a
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantage so there there are aspects
 
04:57:04.830 --> 04:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
to this simple change that may have
 
04:57:08.350 --> 04:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
economic impacts which um could
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
seriously hamper that competition so I
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
think I won't be voting for it either
 
04:57:16.030 --> 04:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
amend it or otherwise okay
 
04:57:19.470 --> 04:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative muts thank you um I I'd
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
just like to respond to you know
 
04:57:23.788 --> 04:57:23.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bernard's comments and
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
and some others as well that you know
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
the way the bill the way this amendment
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
is worded it's it's more than just
 
04:57:32.350 --> 04:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
transparency I mean it I mean if you
 
04:57:35.110 --> 04:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
read the first first four words in the
 
04:57:37.310 --> 04:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
in the amendment it says distribution
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
utilities shall recover costs associated
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
with net metering so and as we learned
 
04:57:46.750 --> 04:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
this morning shall means it's a mandate
 
04:57:51.030 --> 04:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
so this is this is putting in statute a
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
mandate that uh net metering costs can
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
be recovered through a standard a
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
stranded cost uh mechanism if it was
 
04:58:03.310 --> 04:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
purely um for transparency's sake we
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
would use language such as to the extent
 
04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
a utility purchases you know net
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
metering they may they may you know
 
04:58:22.030 --> 04:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.948 --> 04:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
definitive that's a good point but if
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
you change shall to May
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
then that allows them to continue to
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
recover net ring costs through race
 
04:58:36.270 --> 04:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
which buries them and makes them
 
04:58:37.708 --> 04:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
track and destroys any kind of
 
04:58:42.990 --> 04:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
transparency that you would have into
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
those rates so that's the reason the
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
word shall was preferred over may could
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
I representative months yeah could I
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
just you know respond to that I mean
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
what we could do and I'm not saying that
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
I would necessarily support it but just
 
04:58:58.350 --> 04:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
you know what we could do is take out
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
the language it talks about shall
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
recover costs associated with net
 
04:59:02.320 --> 04:59:08.510 align:start position:0%
recover costs associated with net
metering

04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
take take out the the the language that
 
04:59:13.150 --> 04:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
says they that utility shall recover
 
04:59:15.788 --> 04:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
costs and just say utility
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
shall disclose any net metering costs
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
incurred as a St as a um stranded cost
 
04:59:25.360 --> 04:59:26.510 align:start position:0%
incurred as a St as a um stranded cost
recovery

04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
04:59:28.548 --> 04:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
charge if all you're worried of all
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.628 --> 04:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
transparent but that changes the
 
04:59:35.150 --> 04:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
definition of what a stranded cost
 
04:59:38.110 --> 04:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
recovery charge is for correct it's not
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
for disclosing it's
 
04:59:44.270 --> 04:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
for capturing charges that the utility
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
has incurred that it can't recover in
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
means I see your point but but that fix
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
won't work I don't
 
04:59:57.470 --> 04:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
think but I appreciate the uh the
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
Bernardi yes utilities recover these
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
costs no matter matter what so that
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
isn't the issue the issue is the display
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
or the availability to to see them so if
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
they if it's if it's buried in the rates
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
they're recovered or if it's or if it's
 
05:00:19.230 --> 05:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
pulled out as a non- bypassable charge
 
05:00:22.708 --> 05:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
it it's there so it's a transparency
 
05:00:24.750 --> 05:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
issue that's the predominant focus of
 
05:00:24.760 --> 05:00:25.510 align:start position:0%
issue that's the predominant focus of
this

05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:00:28.070 --> 05:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
05:00:31.868 --> 05:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
re thank you Mr chairman uh the larger
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
point the much more significant
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
policy well point an economic point that
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
former commissioner former
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative Belo made in his
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
testimony yesterday is that is the
 
05:00:49.990 --> 05:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive nature and the fact
 
05:00:52.270 --> 05:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
that it would be a reversal a
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
backtracking on the policy and
 
05:00:57.548 --> 05:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
principles of
 
05:01:00.030 --> 05:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
restructuring and it would
 
05:01:02.990 --> 05:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
undercut by authorizing the regular Rel
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
ated utilities to quote recover their
 
05:01:10.190 --> 05:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
costs of net metering it would
 
05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
disadvantage the competitive suppliers
 
05:01:18.670 --> 05:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
and the um Community
 
05:01:18.680 --> 05:01:20.948 align:start position:0%
and the um Community
power

05:01:20.948 --> 05:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
power
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
providers it would increase their cost
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
so this would this is counter to you
 
05:01:28.548 --> 05:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
know more than stated so more than a
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
decade of Pol of of policy okay so we
 
05:01:34.510 --> 05:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
have reached the end of our work session
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
is now 2:00 so we're going to have to
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
move on to our executive
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
session so I'm gonna ask
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
um Christie when she comes back she left
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
right now we're ex she
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
will make a further change to this
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and hopefully we'll get that
 
05:02:00.548 --> 05:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
back before we get to it but in the
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
meantime we can move on to an executive
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
session representative Wendy Thomas did
 
05:02:07.548 --> 05:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
you have a question thank you no it's
 
05:02:09.548 --> 05:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
just a comment I'm waiting to uh be
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
called into another room to testify so I
 
05:02:15.270 --> 05:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
may have to leave at some point I'm just
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
waiting to
 
05:02:20.190 --> 05:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
hear okay what time are you scheduled um
 
05:02:22.350 --> 05:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to start at 2:15 uh from
 
05:02:23.590 --> 05:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
what I understand there's quite a few
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
people lined up so I've asked the the
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
chair to put me as the last speaker so
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
it could be okay I'm just letting you
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
know there there's a
 
05:02:31.760 --> 05:02:35.548 align:start position:0%
know there there's a
chance

05:02:35.548 --> 05:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
159 yeah really okay no problem we're
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
all good okay so we're that's not an
 
05:02:44.470 --> 05:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
issue then right okay all right that
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
being the case then Mr chair I know
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to get to voting so yes
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGee just one final
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
question on 1398 and the amendment um
 
05:02:57.070 --> 05:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
we've brought up the issue of an unfair
 
05:02:59.590 --> 05:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
advantage in having only the utilities
 
05:03:01.470 --> 05:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
be able to recover the net metering
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
costs and
 
05:03:06.270 --> 05:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
so is there any answer here among our
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee as to whether we would be
 
05:03:09.150 --> 05:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
committing that offense with this appeal
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
because we should know before we vote on
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't we well it's not clear to
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
me that that's the case based on what
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
the honorable Clifton Belo told us
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday it Bears further examination I
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
agree um but since we schedule this exec
 
05:03:29.310 --> 05:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
session for
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
today I'm going to suggest that we pass
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and when it gets to the
 
05:03:36.430 --> 05:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
Senate that issue can be addressed in
 
05:03:36.440 --> 05:03:37.548 align:start position:0%
Senate that issue can be addressed in
the

05:03:37.548 --> 05:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
Senate and we know that uh Clifton Boo
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
has a good relationship with several
 
05:03:46.350 --> 05:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate so I'm sure he'll
 
05:03:49.788 --> 05:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
be able to address those issues promptly
 
05:03:52.350 --> 05:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
if he'd have brought him to my attention
 
05:03:54.788 --> 05:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
before yesterday we might have had time
 
05:03:58.190 --> 05:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with this in time for us to deal
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know make changes here in this
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee but he didn't do that so
 
05:04:07.150 --> 05:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
um we'll see where it goes if this is
 
05:04:09.070 --> 05:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
our last chance to speak before we just
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
have to say yay or nay then no we'll
 
05:04:15.270 --> 05:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
have a debate we we will yeah typically
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
in exec sessions remember we make a make
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
a motion on the floor and then we
 
05:04:23.948 --> 05:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
discuss it okay
 
05:04:26.430 --> 05:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
05:04:29.190 --> 05:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to open an exact session on
 
05:04:31.110 --> 05:04:31.120 align:start position:0%

05:05:19.110 --> 05:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
first now the clerk tells me that's not
 
05:05:21.270 --> 05:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
the way you do it the clerk says the
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass as

as amended by Amendment 2024
 
05:09:30.110 --> 05:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
0099 H since it was a unanimous vote is
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
there any uh um objection to putting it
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar no
 
05:09:44.868 --> 05:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
is uh representative Thomas um I have
 
05:09:51.430 --> 05:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
Thomas I have a question for the chair
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
uh under this procedure of voting uh
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
otpa in the
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
future what in the past we've known
 
05:10:03.628 --> 05:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
people that would vote for the amendment
 
05:10:06.070 --> 05:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
but then wouldn't vote for the actual
 
05:10:08.590 --> 05:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
otpa how is that how would that be
 
05:10:11.070 --> 05:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
handled under the procedure that that we
 
05:10:11.080 --> 05:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
handled under the procedure that that we
just

05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
did good
 
05:10:17.548 --> 05:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
question not sure the answer for that
 
05:10:19.470 --> 05:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
that's F sure the answer to that when we
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
were taught this we were taught that we
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
had to do the amendment separately and
 
05:10:27.430 --> 05:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
then the then the amendment the you know
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended but the clerk I know
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
he gave you different instructions so I
 
05:10:34.400 --> 05:10:35.830 align:start position:0%
he gave you different instructions so I
I'm

05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.990 --> 05:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
well maybe we'll go back to doing it the
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
old way then just to be just to be safe
 
05:10:45.760 --> 05:10:46.830 align:start position:0%
old way then just to be just to be safe
I

05:10:46.830 --> 05:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
don't perhaps to cover us we should just
 
05:10:52.310 --> 05:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
take a second vote just to cover
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
us all representative
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
N I agree I I would agree but but but
 
05:11:02.190 --> 05:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
the vote was 19 to zero so I don't see
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
why we should use the time and I agree
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
with representative n yeah if it's if
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's the consensus then fine we can make
 
05:11:10.320 --> 05:11:12.628 align:start position:0%
it's the consensus then fine we can make
no

05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
that all right is there any objection to
 
05:11:16.830 --> 05:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
the committee to letting the vote as we
 
05:11:19.150 --> 05:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
just took it
 
05:11:21.990 --> 05:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
stand no Mr chairman I I would suest we
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
will shift our our methodology for this
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
I suggest if we are aware that it's
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
non-c contentious we should we could go
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
to the otpa because there wouldn't be
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
any any opposing vote to log but if if
 
05:11:36.990 --> 05:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
we know that we're not all in agreement
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
then maybe we should do the two-step
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
process so that it's on
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
record but then the question would would
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
be do we always know that exactly
 
05:11:46.920 --> 05:11:48.430 align:start position:0%
be do we always know that exactly
exactly

05:11:48.430 --> 05:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
05:11:52.548 --> 05:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
so yeah we did but okay representative
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas no I was just going to say
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
let's standardize the pro the process
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
and let's just vote on the the amendment
 
05:12:01.708 --> 05:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
before any I mean just standardize it
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
then we'd have nothing to
 
05:12:05.948 --> 05:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
discuss yes we will do that for the rest
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
of the uh exec session
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
bills all right so close the exact
 
05:12:15.788 --> 05:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
1047 and open an EXA exact session on
 
05:12:19.200 --> 05:12:22.030 align:start position:0%
1047 and open an EXA exact session on
hb1

05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.150 --> 05:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
1230 and I
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Michael
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington for a motion yeah I move uh
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
itl on HB 1230
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
zero chair recognizes representative n
 
05:12:40.830 --> 05:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
second it's moved and seconded that we
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
resolve that hb1
 
05:12:46.190 --> 05:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
1230 is inexpedient to legislate is
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative MC
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you chair Vose um I just
 
05:12:59.708 --> 05:12:59.718 align:start position:0%
want to note for the record that um it's
 
05:13:00.990 --> 05:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to do a study bill in the
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
second year um and I do think that there
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
were a lot of underlying good ideas in
 
05:13:08.270 --> 05:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
this bill um so perhaps it's something
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
that we could consider bringing forward
 
05:13:14.350 --> 05:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
in uh the following house session thank
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you by the way
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
representative McGee it just occurred to
 
05:13:21.948 --> 05:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
me uh representative cap Kaplan is
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
absent do we know anything about that uh
 
05:13:27.868 --> 05:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
he's testifying I believe he had he's
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
here but he had a hear he had a hearing
 
05:13:32.708 --> 05:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
in another room he's the
 
05:13:35.910 --> 05:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
spons do we want to suspend any votes
 
05:13:37.990 --> 05:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
until he gets
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
back anything that's your call I mean
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah anything that might be contentious
 
05:13:43.868 --> 05:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
I would think we
 
05:13:46.350 --> 05:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
would I I don't I don't think this one
 
05:13:50.110 --> 05:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.310 --> 05:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
it well if we could skip that great does
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
anybody have any idea when he might be
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:14:05.788 align:start position:0%
 
can

05:14:05.788 --> 05:14:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think I saw a message that he's
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.150 --> 05:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.708 --> 05:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
hour if you if you could just drag him
 
05:14:22.430 --> 05:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
over here for five minutes we can take
 
05:14:25.270 --> 05:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
this vote he can he can register his
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.190 --> 05:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
back I'm sorry I didn't recogn I his
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
absence uh before we took the vote on
 
05:14:43.590 --> 05:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:00.600 --> 05:15:33.310 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:15:33.310 --> 05:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.270 --> 05:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
where is Commerce meeting do you
 
05:15:36.280 --> 05:16:00.510 align:start position:0%
where is Commerce meeting do you
know

05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:28.110 --> 05:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker Mr Speaker Mr chairman
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
question yes I I realize we try to get
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
as many people here as possible but this
 
05:16:34.350 --> 05:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
is a scheduled meeting if someone
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
chooses to be some Poli Sal I don't see
 
05:16:38.110 --> 05:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
how we can accommodate that based on
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
other hearings otherwise we'll never get
 
05:16:41.590 --> 05:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
this done because there's a possibility
 
05:16:43.390 --> 05:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
anytime we schedule a hearing they could
 
05:16:45.070 --> 05:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
be in a hearing someplace else person's
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
going to have to make a decision that
 
05:16:48.670 --> 05:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
they can always submit written testimony
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
and be here but I don't think we should
 
05:16:51.868 --> 05:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
all sit around and wait whether it's a
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
Republican or a Democrat we're waiting
 
05:16:55.310 --> 05:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
for it just isn't fair to the rest of us
 
05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
to have to sit here because someone
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
chooses to be someplace else they should
 
05:17:00.910 --> 05:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony and be here
 
05:17:02.430 --> 05:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
this is their first priority this is the
 
05:17:03.788 --> 05:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
committee they member
 
05:17:06.510 --> 05:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
of now you make a really good point
 
05:17:09.628 --> 05:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
there representative Harrington so we'll
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
wait until representative Thomas comes
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
back and then we'll proceed we'll
 
05:17:18.390 --> 05:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
continue whether she has representative
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.400 --> 05:18:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
not

05:18:29.310 --> 05:18:29.320 align:start position:0%

event amendment

05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
20241
 
05:42:31.830 --> 05:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
02h I I have the original that I sent to
 
05:42:35.590 --> 05:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
OS and I'm now going to verify that it
 
05:42:37.670 --> 05:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
matches what we asked them to do so on
 
05:42:41.310 --> 05:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
line 10 they inserted the word projected
 
05:42:43.510 --> 05:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
in front of cost benefit
 
05:42:48.030 --> 05:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
analysis and on line
 
05:42:50.190 --> 05:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
22 they
 
05:42:54.510 --> 05:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
inserted the words organizations such
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
as which is exactly what we asked them
 
05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
to do so this um Amendment appears to be
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
and it says unapproved what we uh what
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted is there any further
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:12.628 --> 05:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
amendment representative MC Williams
 
05:43:14.270 --> 05:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
just a question on the amendment usually
 
05:43:16.510 --> 05:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
we have um a representative's name for
 
05:43:18.310 --> 05:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
who the drafter or who was supporting
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.040 --> 05:43:44.350 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

05:43:44.350 --> 05:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
I don't think it needs a name it has a
 
05:43:49.948 --> 05:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
number um and it's basically a committee
 
05:43:53.868 --> 05:43:53.878 align:start position:0%

05:51:21.070 --> 05:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
20241
 
05:51:24.030 --> 05:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
03h additional
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
discussion well the
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh the new Amendment does change the
 
05:51:33.150 --> 05:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
wording as we
 
05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
requested by
 
05:51:37.990 --> 05:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
removing the phrase standard cost
 
05:51:40.788 --> 05:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
recovery charge so it now says
 
05:51:42.670 --> 05:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities shall recover
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
costs associated with net metering of
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
group hosting through a non- bypassable
 
05:51:49.310 --> 05:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
charge as approved by the commission as
 
05:51:51.030 --> 05:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
long as those charges are displayed on
 
05:51:51.040 --> 05:51:52.430 align:start position:0%
long as those charges are displayed on
customer

05:51:52.430 --> 05:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
customer
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
bills so that is the the amendment
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I I have a question
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
um how does passing this bill create any
 
05:52:06.270 --> 05:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
difference from what is happening on
 
05:52:08.430 --> 05:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
customer bills today because we keep
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
talking about how we're doing it in
 
05:52:13.948 --> 05:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
service of transparency but I think
 
05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
right now net metering charges are being
 
05:52:20.750 --> 05:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
recovered under a non- bypassable charge
 
05:52:23.708 --> 05:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
whether it's um the stranded cost charge
 
05:52:26.468 --> 05:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
or other and they appear on the
 
05:52:28.510 --> 05:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
customer's bill but the customer Custer
 
05:52:30.468 --> 05:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
still has to call the utility if they
 
05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
want to understand those charges they're
 
05:52:34.750 --> 05:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
not they're not spelled out anywhere so
 
05:52:39.788 --> 05:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
anything so the way that this
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
bill changes the current um current
 
05:52:48.030 --> 05:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
policy is that it requires that those
 
05:52:51.070 --> 05:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
nonb bypassable charges be displayed on
 
05:52:53.788 --> 05:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
customer Bills currently Unitil does not
 
05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
display their external distribution
 
05:52:59.948 --> 05:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
charge on their customer bills but they
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
use that charge to recover net metering
 
05:53:05.948 --> 05:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
costs does that answer your question yes
 
05:53:08.190 --> 05:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
and um the other question that I would
 
05:53:10.030 --> 05:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
follow on with that I think came out of
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
the hearings that we should address or
 
05:53:15.750 --> 05:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
at least understand is what effect this
 
05:53:19.830 --> 05:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
would have on the the energy Market in
 
05:53:22.310 --> 05:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the the competitive energy
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
Market in New Hampshire in terms of
 
05:53:29.910 --> 05:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
providing an advantage to the the um
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
default utilities
 
05:53:35.590 --> 05:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
that is not being offered to anyone else
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:42.788 --> 05:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
market that was
 
05:53:45.670 --> 05:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
a question that was asked about the bill
 
05:53:49.868 --> 05:53:49.878 align:start position:0%
during the course of the public hearing
 
05:53:54.190 --> 05:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
and that question was never thoroughly
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
answered and probably requires further
 
05:54:00.430 --> 05:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
study okay and based on that I w't won't
 
05:54:02.670 --> 05:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
be able to vote for the amendment
 
05:54:04.788 --> 05:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah just
 
05:54:06.270 --> 05:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
maybe I can clarify that just a little
 
05:54:08.468 --> 05:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
bit presently at least like for ever
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
Source the charge is in the distribution
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
rate which is non bypassable because
 
05:54:15.030 --> 05:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
everybody that's in ever Source customer
 
05:54:16.390 --> 05:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they get from
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier a default service
 
05:54:20.590 --> 05:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
rate however they get their power they
 
05:54:23.110 --> 05:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
pay that in the in the rate so it's not
 
05:54:26.110 --> 05:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
going to be an advantage or disadvantage
 
05:54:27.708 --> 05:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
to competitive suppliers because it's
 
05:54:29.708 --> 05:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
still something that doesn't affect the
 
05:54:31.830 --> 05:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
Energy Service rate which the Energy
 
05:54:34.190 --> 05:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
Service rate is what people compete on
 
05:54:35.468 --> 05:54:35.478 align:start position:0%
that's what you when you go to someone
 
05:54:38.270 --> 05:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
like Direct Energy or whoever uh you're
 
05:54:40.110 --> 05:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the Energy Service rate and
 
05:54:42.390 --> 05:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
it'll say a certain cost but that cost
 
05:54:44.590 --> 05:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't include this one way or the
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
other either now or would this bill
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
passed it still wouldn't
 
05:54:53.468 --> 05:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
so so I have a have a question maybe
 
05:54:55.110 --> 05:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
that go Ahad representative Harrington
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
could answer for me then so why is net
 
05:54:59.468 --> 05:54:59.478 align:start position:0%
metering being called out as opposed to
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
any other form of
 
05:55:03.830 --> 05:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
energy it's just a separate charge that
 
05:55:05.070 --> 05:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
was decided to bring out that way
 
05:55:06.230 --> 05:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
they'll have to ask the sponsor of the
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill on that what I'm saying is it has
 
05:55:10.708 --> 05:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
no effect on someone that goes out as a
 
05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier because they're
 
05:55:14.430 --> 05:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
only competing on the energy and the way
 
05:55:16.390 --> 05:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
it is right now it's either in the
 
05:55:18.310 --> 05:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery which is non-
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
bypassable or it's part of the
 
05:55:20.990 --> 05:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
distribution rates which is non-
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
bypassable just the I think the
 
05:55:24.750 --> 05:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
distribution rate is obviously made up
 
05:55:26.670 --> 05:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
of a whole mess of stuff where the
 
05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery is
 
05:55:30.110 --> 05:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
maybe three or four different items
 
05:55:32.910 --> 05:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
that's the ma major
 
05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:39.510 --> 05:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
discuss representative Tony
 
05:55:42.910 --> 05:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
Kaplan just to further you know the
 
05:55:45.150 --> 05:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
question further along those lines from
 
05:55:46.948 --> 05:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
what I understood from the discussion
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
that we had in in the work session
 
05:55:51.628 --> 05:55:51.638 align:start position:0%
yesterday this stranded cost uh recovery
 
05:55:53.788 --> 05:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism which is already in play
 
05:55:57.548 --> 05:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
allows the uh the the the default
 
05:56:01.230 --> 05:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
utility ities to recover their costs in
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
a way that it would not allow
 
05:56:05.670 --> 05:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers to recover their
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
cost they don't have that mechanism so
 
05:56:11.230 --> 05:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
they're not recovering the same costs
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're not recovering the totality of
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
05:56:17.868 --> 05:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
paying correct or or not but that is the
 
05:56:19.390 --> 05:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
reality of
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
how the law exists today and this
 
05:56:27.548 --> 05:56:27.558 align:start position:0%
amendment or this bill doesn't seek to
 
05:56:27.558 --> 05:56:28.708 align:start position:0%
amendment or this bill doesn't seek to
change

05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:56:32.510 --> 05:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
that just seeks to change how the
 
05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
information is provided to customers so
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
while what the honorable honorable Mr
 
05:56:43.948 --> 05:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
Belo was saying may be true this bill
 
05:56:45.510 --> 05:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
was never trying to fix that in the
 
05:56:48.150 --> 05:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
first place that requires a different
 
05:56:50.868 --> 05:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
fix and presumably that's a fix that
 
05:56:52.990 --> 05:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
he's working on
 
05:56:56.070 --> 05:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but it's not really relevant
 
05:56:58.990 --> 05:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
to this bill bill this bill is strictly
 
05:57:02.350 --> 05:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
a bill to try to make net metering costs
 
05:57:05.310 --> 05:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
more transparent by putting them on a
 
05:57:07.310 --> 05:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
customer bill in a form that the
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
customer could use to to uh discover
 
05:57:11.280 --> 05:57:12.430 align:start position:0%
customer could use to to uh discover
more

05:57:12.430 --> 05:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:57:14.708 --> 05:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
about those
 
05:57:17.548 --> 05:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
costs yeah I mean I agree that that is
 
05:57:19.708 --> 05:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
the the the Practical effect that this
 
05:57:23.990 --> 05:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh is making but by providing this
 
05:57:26.468 --> 05:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
language and statute it it strengthens
 
05:57:29.590 --> 05:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
that mechanism Le Al and it locks it in
 
05:57:31.708 --> 05:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
as as the mechanism that the default
 
05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
service providers are allowed to use uh
 
05:57:36.990 --> 05:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
which makes it harder to then row it
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
back which is you know someone might be
 
05:57:40.468 --> 05:57:40.478 align:start position:0%
trying to do that but it's it's once we
 
05:57:44.190 --> 05:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
put it in statute it it becomes the law
 
05:57:46.510 --> 05:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
of the land whereas now it's just they
 
05:57:47.830 --> 05:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's how they're doing it because of a
 
05:57:52.110 --> 05:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
pu order am I
 
05:57:54.510 --> 05:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
right I'm not sure that you are right
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
about that but once again it's a
 
05:57:58.990 --> 05:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
different problem the reason the word
 
05:58:01.390 --> 05:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
shall is in there as we discussed and
 
05:58:03.948 --> 05:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
maybe you word here for that um the work
 
05:58:07.150 --> 05:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
session right before this um we started
 
05:58:09.390 --> 05:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
our executive sessions is because
 
05:58:11.548 --> 05:58:11.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't appear on customer
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
bills that's that's the key reason for
 
05:58:17.510 --> 05:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
the word shall as opposed to
 
05:58:20.150 --> 05:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
May in this in this language in this
 
05:58:23.628 --> 05:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
sentence representative Ms thank you um
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
I I will be uh voting against this
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
amendment for precisely the reasons that
 
05:58:32.270 --> 05:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kaplan just um
 
05:58:32.280 --> 05:58:34.270 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kaplan just um
discussed

05:58:34.270 --> 05:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
05:58:38.110 --> 05:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
um you know this this bill if it passes
 
05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
will put in statute as far as I know for
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
the first time the concept that net
 
05:58:46.350 --> 05:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
metering costs can be recovered through
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
bypassable charges and we'll tie our
 
05:58:50.670 --> 05:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
hands in terms of trying to address some
 
05:58:53.150 --> 05:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
of the issues that I think there's
 
05:58:56.030 --> 05:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
General agreement need to be addressed
 
05:59:00.788 --> 05:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
um and so um given that uh I I fall back
 
05:59:03.468 --> 05:59:03.478 align:start position:0%
on the old adage of um you know when in
 
05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
doubt Do no harm so I will be uh voting
 
05:59:07.468 --> 05:59:07.478 align:start position:0%
against this
 
05:59:09.468 --> 05:59:09.478 align:start position:0%
amendment further discussion
 
05:59:12.990 --> 05:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you um I
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
will be voting for the amendment but
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
against the bill whether amended or not
 
05:59:19.708 --> 05:59:19.718 align:start position:0%
um I feel that the amendment at least
 
05:59:21.990 --> 05:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
takes out the stranded cost part which I
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
feel is just not appropriate but um for
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
reasons I've stated before and don't
 
05:59:30.110 --> 05:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
need to restate I just don't care for
 
05:59:31.708 --> 05:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
the bill at
 
05:59:35.510 --> 05:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
all representative leki uh thank you Mr
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think what we found is
 
05:59:41.948 --> 05:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
coincident or incidental to what the
 
05:59:44.270 --> 05:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
bill is and I wonder whether there's a
 
05:59:46.468 --> 05:59:46.478 align:start position:0%
possibility of putting in a fix for net
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
metering in community power if there is
 
05:59:52.670 --> 05:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
a fix possible in some other bill as an
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
amendment or uh whatever uh as we
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
proceed and that might be a way to get
 
05:59:59.868 --> 05:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
something in this year but clearly there
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
is a glitch Community power is a
 
06:00:04.510 --> 06:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
fledgling program and this is an
 
06:00:06.910 --> 06:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
oversight apparently in uh how it was
 
06:00:06.920 --> 06:00:08.070 align:start position:0%
oversight apparently in uh how it was
set

06:00:08.070 --> 06:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
set
 
06:00:10.628 --> 06:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
up I can virtually guarantee there would
 
06:00:13.468 --> 06:00:13.478 align:start position:0%
be a fix proposed in the Senate if this
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
bill got that far representative
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman uh I'm in
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
the same boat as my colleague
 
06:00:22.670 --> 06:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Corman I'm going to vote
 
06:00:25.788 --> 06:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
for the amendment appreciating that we
 
06:00:30.070 --> 06:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
intended to take out the labeling of uh
 
06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
distribution uh sorry of uh cost of net
 
06:00:36.590 --> 06:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
metering as as stranded cost but I I did
 
06:00:39.070 --> 06:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
just want to ask a clarifying question
 
06:00:42.948 --> 06:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
because um line three of of the
 
06:00:46.628 --> 06:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
amendment still contains the the term
 
06:00:48.670 --> 06:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery so I'm not sure
 
06:00:51.070 --> 06:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's a problem because am I correct to
 
06:00:52.750 --> 06:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
say that that it's only line five
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
through eight that becomes actual
 
06:00:56.440 --> 06:00:58.868 align:start position:0%
through eight that becomes actual
legislation

06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:01:02.190 --> 06:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
but no I think that actually
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
is the title of the section of law that
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment is being applied to so
 
06:01:13.788 --> 06:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
that that stranded cost recovery
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism language is already in the
 
06:01:18.750 --> 06:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
section of law that this section is
 
06:01:21.868 --> 06:01:21.878 align:start position:0%
being applied to okay so that is that is
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
existing statutory language line
 
06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
three but lines five and through eight
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
are what will actually be uh inserted
 
06:01:34.310 --> 06:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
and that language does not include
 
06:01:37.548 --> 06:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
stranded costs the term stranded costs
 
06:01:40.230 --> 06:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
so correct I think I'm okay with that
 
06:01:43.070 --> 06:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative Doug
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um yes um I'll
 
06:01:49.110 --> 06:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
I will be voting for the amendment and
 
06:01:52.030 --> 06:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
the bill because although I think the
 
06:01:54.350 --> 06:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
06:01:56.788 --> 06:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
unintentionally uh highlighted an issue
 
06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
we have with Community power that this
 
06:02:03.230 --> 06:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill didn't seek to fix or or U or
 
06:02:04.990 --> 06:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
address because that's a a different
 
06:02:06.670 --> 06:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
issue but it actually did highlight an
 
06:02:09.510 --> 06:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
issue uh and that can be fixed by by
 
06:02:11.830 --> 06:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
some other method uh I think this bill
 
06:02:14.548 --> 06:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
is uh as far as I can see
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
it the charges are already being charged
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
the customers are already paying for
 
06:02:22.190 --> 06:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
them uh it becomes an issue of where do
 
06:02:24.990 --> 06:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
they appear in the bill or in one case
 
06:02:28.190 --> 06:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
even if even if it appears on your bill
 
06:02:31.868 --> 06:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
this bill merely for transparency says
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
these charges will appear on your
 
06:02:33.600 --> 06:02:34.548 align:start position:0%
these charges will appear on your
electric

06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
electric
 
06:02:37.750 --> 06:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill and it doesn't and to best my
 
06:02:40.430 --> 06:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge does not cost the utilities to
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
to to do that it won't cost the
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
customers any more money and and does no
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
harm to anyone else so this is a very
 
06:02:49.468 --> 06:02:49.478 align:start position:0%
straightforward transparency bill it's
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
like an accounting method moving a
 
06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
charge from one column to the next for
 
06:02:55.390 --> 06:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
transparency purposes and for more
 
06:02:57.350 --> 06:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
clarity that's how I see it that's why
 
06:02:58.708 --> 06:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
I'll be supporting
 
06:03:02.510 --> 06:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
it representative Stephen Kennedy yeah
 
06:03:04.628 --> 06:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
just to follow up uh thanks for
 
06:03:06.910 --> 06:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing me just to follow up on what
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
doug was saying a lot of people are
 
06:03:11.390 --> 06:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
talking about recovering costs as if
 
06:03:14.070 --> 06:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
someone is paying the utility for these
 
06:03:16.510 --> 06:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
costs they're not that it just goes into
 
06:03:18.468 --> 06:03:18.478 align:start position:0%
the bill you know the customer is still
 
06:03:20.750 --> 06:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
paying the cost and I don't understand
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
why the community thing would be any
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
different I mean you know they could pay
 
06:03:27.390 --> 06:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
people to supply power through their
 
06:03:30.910 --> 06:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
solar array and then they would you know
 
06:03:33.910 --> 06:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
charge more or or whatever they decide
 
06:03:36.430 --> 06:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
to charge uh their customers would be
 
06:03:38.670 --> 06:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
how they recover that
 
06:03:42.670 --> 06:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
cost so I I I you know I think you can
 
06:03:44.590 --> 06:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
go either way on this but I I think it
 
06:03:47.868 --> 06:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
is just an accounting mechanism it isn't
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
like somehow you know the the main
 
06:03:52.990 --> 06:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
utilities get to recover their cost from
 
06:03:55.230 --> 06:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
some magic fund or something and the
 
06:03:57.030 --> 06:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
other guys don't I don't think it works
 
06:03:59.110 --> 06:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
like that at
 
06:04:04.788 --> 06:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
all representative migy okay so um
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
what's come up is where this is going to
 
06:04:08.468 --> 06:04:08.478 align:start position:0%
be placed right the stranded cost
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
recovery mechanisms is under the
 
06:04:13.548 --> 06:04:13.558 align:start position:0%
restructuring statute so it's specific
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
to default utilities but the language
 
06:04:20.390 --> 06:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's here under 7A I think what uh the
 
06:04:22.830 --> 06:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
question has been is if distributed
 
06:04:26.310 --> 06:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
utilities are allow shall recover costs
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
associated with net metering and group
 
06:04:32.190 --> 06:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
hosting then why wouldn't it be for all
 
06:04:34.910 --> 06:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
all suppliers right so in other words
 
06:04:37.830 --> 06:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the statute here is under restructuring
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
so it only applies to you know what used
 
06:04:42.910 --> 06:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
to be the monop Monopoly utilities and I
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
think the conversation yesterday
 
06:04:45.910 --> 06:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
indicated that this could help take us
 
06:04:48.190 --> 06:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
back in that direction rather than in
 
06:04:49.548 --> 06:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
the direction that we've sort of
 
06:04:51.030 --> 06:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
indicated we want to
 
06:04:54.628 --> 06:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
go uh which is to inspire more
 
06:04:56.628 --> 06:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
competition in order to create you know
 
06:04:59.750 --> 06:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
choice for people and lower rates so I
 
06:05:03.548 --> 06:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
still see it as two things the Pu docket
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
on the net metering tariff is unresolved
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's a major reason
 
06:05:11.390 --> 06:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
why we should not be inserting something
 
06:05:15.270 --> 06:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
here that um changes the way this
 
06:05:17.948 --> 06:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
accounting works I think we will have
 
06:05:19.750 --> 06:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
more answers when that docket is
 
06:05:22.390 --> 06:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
resolved and so for that reason I will
 
06:05:24.030 --> 06:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
also vote for the amendment because it
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
improves the original bill but I will be
 
06:05:27.830 --> 06:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
voting against the bill
 
06:05:29.350 --> 06:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we should be doing
 
06:05:31.350 --> 06:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
this at this point without better
 
06:05:33.190 --> 06:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
information and more clarity really
 
06:05:35.150 --> 06:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
frankly on the entire committee as to
 
06:05:37.750 --> 06:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
what it is that we're actually
 
06:05:41.910 --> 06:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:44.110 --> 06:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
discussion representative randles you
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
can turn off your mic now oh I'm sorry
 
06:05:49.628 --> 06:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
um seeing none I'll ask the K clerk to
 
06:05:51.990 --> 06:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
call the role on the question of
 
06:05:54.910 --> 06:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
adoption of the amendment
 
06:06:00.510 --> 06:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:03.868 --> 06:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas yes

second that okay it's been moved and
 
06:09:42.030 --> 06:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:47.390 --> 06:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
1398 for interim study the reason I have
 
06:09:49.830 --> 06:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
moved interim study is I don't want to
 
06:09:53.110 --> 06:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
be responsible for sending to the house
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
floor for
 
06:09:59.310 --> 06:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
debate with a without recommendation a
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill on net metering because I don't
 
06:10:05.150 --> 06:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
want to watch my fellow house members
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
fall asleep listening to a debate that
 
06:10:12.270 --> 06:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:15.150 --> 06:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
understand so that's why I have moved
 
06:10:15.160 --> 06:10:16.230 align:start position:0%
understand so that's why I have moved
interim

06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
interim
 
06:10:19.948 --> 06:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
study I do think this uh this issue will
 
06:10:22.750 --> 06:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
surface again I virtually guarantee
 
06:10:26.628 --> 06:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
it and uh I was pleased to hear rep
 
06:10:28.750 --> 06:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives McGee and Corman uh
 
06:10:31.868 --> 06:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier the fact that the open
 
06:10:34.430 --> 06:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
currently open net metering docket might
 
06:10:38.350 --> 06:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
be a good reason to avoid action on net
 
06:10:41.830 --> 06:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
metering bills this session so we'll
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
take that under advisement and uh move
 
06:10:49.708 --> 06:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
forward so is there any other discussion
 
06:10:53.110 --> 06:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
on this motion representative Ms just a
 
06:10:55.670 --> 06:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
just a question Mr chair can you remind
 
06:10:58.430 --> 06:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
me refer to study what does that enable
 
06:10:59.390 --> 06:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
us to
 
06:11:02.670 --> 06:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
do so a motion of refer for interim
 
06:11:05.150 --> 06:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
study enables the committee if it so
 
06:11:08.510 --> 06:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
chooses to do some further study on the
 
06:11:11.548 --> 06:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
bill it requires according to house
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
rules that by November 14th or something
 
06:11:17.548 --> 06:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
I don't remember the exact date without
 
06:11:19.430 --> 06:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
looking in the house calendar it
 
06:11:22.310 --> 06:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
requires that we issue a
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation that says we recommend
 
06:11:27.190 --> 06:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
this for further
 
06:11:30.310 --> 06:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh legislation or we do not recommend
 
06:11:32.750 --> 06:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
this for further legislation we have to
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
make that
 
06:11:36.948 --> 06:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
judgment sometime in October or
 
06:11:39.510 --> 06:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
November beyond that it's up to us to
 
06:11:42.110 --> 06:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
decide as a committee if we want to
 
06:11:44.468 --> 06:11:44.478 align:start position:0%
actually study the bill it's up to the
 
06:11:45.708 --> 06:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
date of the
 
06:11:48.590 --> 06:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
election up to the date of the election
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay up to the date of the next election
 
06:11:55.150 --> 06:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
which is the first Tuesday of 2024 of
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
November 2024
 
06:12:00.270 --> 06:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Corman
 
06:12:02.310 --> 06:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh just pertaining to your uh comment
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
about nit metering I do want to point
 
06:12:06.350 --> 06:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
out I did introduce uh another bill on
 
06:12:08.990 --> 06:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
net metering that Cliff Belo wrote uh
 
06:12:10.350 --> 06:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
but I hope it will be a lot less
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
controversial it's just saying to treat
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
net metering as load reducers um so we
 
06:12:17.948 --> 06:12:17.958 align:start position:0%
will be taking up one more net metering
 
06:12:18.990 --> 06:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
bill at
 
06:12:19.000 --> 06:12:22.468 align:start position:0%

1398 and that concludes our business for
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
today I would ask all members to keep an
 
06:14:19.990 --> 06:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
eye on their email because we will be
 
06:14:22.948 --> 06:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
scheduling committee work for next
 
06:14:27.510 --> 06:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
Tuesday which is the 16th of
 
06:14:29.628 --> 06:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
January I suspect there will be some
 
06:14:31.468 --> 06:14:31.478 align:start position:0%
public hearings there may even be an
 
06:14:34.030 --> 06:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
exec session on bills we heard earlier
 
06:14:37.868 --> 06:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
today so pay particular attention to
 
06:14:41.390 --> 06:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
your email does anyone else have any
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
matters that they would like to bring
