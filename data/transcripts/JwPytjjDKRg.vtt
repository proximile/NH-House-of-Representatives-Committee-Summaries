of committees and commissions to be
 
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 align:start position:0%

you um I will
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
correct a statement I made earlier about
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
it um I believe I was under the
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
impression that um the Constitution
 
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
talks about this gold star Mother's Day
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
um this now says that it's actually RSA
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
for colon
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
13h that does that so if we look at and
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
I wish I had made a copy of all of this
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
um lists all of the different events
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
executive um Branch does
 
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.749 align:start position:0%
executive um Branch does
for

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
um every event you can possibly think of
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
um you know uh from the birthdays of all
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
of our um branches military branches the
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
governor uh does the proclamation for um
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
for that um also mentioned in that is
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
the um actual Proclamation that the
 
00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
governor shall do uh for goldar Mother's
 
00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:36.630 align:start position:0%
governor shall do uh for goldar Mother's
Day

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
Day
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
um in in the um in the section that
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
deals with the birthdays of the uh
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
military branches it actually speaks to
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
the um uh shall have the flag flown um
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
over the state house or on the State
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
House complex so um there would be no
 
00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:00.519 align:start position:0%
reason why anyone couldn't
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
um request a pro a similar Proclamation
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
from the governor and that seems to be
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
the correct way to handle this is to
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
have U the U the governor make a
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
proclamation of it being uh gold star
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day and um and have uh Flags
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
flown or whatever else uh she would like
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
to have done so uh rather than us
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
putting it um in Statue and handling it
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
separately um it's already in statute
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
but it's under the executive branch so
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the best way to do it
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
Is there further
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
conversation about yes representative W
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and given
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
that this already exist in statute um
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
the celebration of gold star Mother's
 
00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
Day and the fact that there are other
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
days where it specifies raising the flag
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to amend this to
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
specify within that RSA to um raise the
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
flag or read or read out a proclamation
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
group uh thank you for your question I
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
assume that's to me um so uh there is
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
there if you read the proclamation or
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
the section that I mentioned
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
413 um it says it it encompasses all of
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
this um it says that the governor shall
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
do I should just pull it up let me just
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
pull it up and read exactly rather than
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
paraphrase um RSA
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
browse uh
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
for powers of the governor and councel
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
in certain
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
13h so it says uh the governor shall
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
annually issue a proclamation calling
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the proper observance of the first
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
Sunday after Easter which is shall be
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
known as gold star Mother's Day
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
recognizing and honoring all mothers who
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
have lost Sons or daughters while on
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
duty in the United States armed forces
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
this is the key sentence the governor
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
shall urge the citizens of the state to
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
observe this day with appropriate events
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
the appropriate events I believe is is
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
um in that Proclamation saying all of
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
those things like um we're going to have
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
a flag raising uh over the State House
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
um yes uh thank you um for the comment I
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
think that sentence is very important
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony that we heard um
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
from the families that were here this is
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
a very special it's a special flag and
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
that executive order um Proclamation and
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
the RSA that the executive can do
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
can um allow this flag to be really uh
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
closely remembered either in towns where
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
it where the the governor makes that
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
Proclamation and really because the
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that flag it's so
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
special people need to get kind of up
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
close and have uh ceremonies to that I
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
feel that only in conquered is not
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
enough um let's make sure that the
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
governor puts out that Proclamation and
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
and in in and support those families to
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
utilize this already existing RSA thank
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
you represent representative wall thank
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much first off could
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
someone shut that door please it's
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
awfully noisy I want to be
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
heard okay thank you very much I I
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the comments I was
 
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
unaware of that section that you found
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman and I appreciate that um
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
I I've been planning to vote for this to
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
be supportive of all the families who
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
came in here and all I I will say I come
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
from a military family I understand
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
where everyone's coming from I respect
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
it my I have one question how we would
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
get the governor to do the proclamation
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
but I want to
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
say I've witnessed over my entire life
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
the meaning of having Flags where people
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
can see them and talk about them and
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
gather and have a little ceremony around
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
them and as much as I love our state
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
house and I do look at the Dome every
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
time we go by to be perfectly truthful I
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't always look to see what flags are
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
up there because I guess we know what's
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
up there um I have asked in the past if
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have it up there if we could
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
have it down in the plaza there is a
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
flag pole there but that is reserved for
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
another occasion another purpose um I've
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
asked also if we could have at the State
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
library and that didn't work so giving
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
it a whole lot of thought and talking
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
with a lot of people in my area and I
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
come from where PE Air Force Base was in
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
the Navy Ard and all a lot of military
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
people um actually they would like to
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
see the flag where they could have a
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
little ceremony around it you know I'm
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to support um itl
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
thank you not because I don't want the
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
flag on the dome but because I want it
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
where the people can come closest to it
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
but my question Mr chairman is how do we
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
get this message to the governor so that
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
we can be sure that this happens thank
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
you for your question
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I saw a little word in that in that
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
section that said shall um so it would
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
seem to me the the governor shall be
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
doing this um it's the the word needs to
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
go from anyone whe whether it's the
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
representative that brought the the bill
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
to us in the first place or any one of
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
us um to indicate to the governor um
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
what what activities um would be
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
suggested and and then it's up to the
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
governor to make those those that part
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
of the Proclamation so as I understand
 
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
anybody can approach the government
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
might it make sense then if we
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
individually contact as well well as
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
have our executive counselor from our
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
area do that sort of thing to make sure
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
that this happens that's how I read the
 
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
statute yes um just so you're aware
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
um I think as I told you it's four colon
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
13h let me tell you some of the others
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
that are um all the other letters of the
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
alphabet so we have Lafayette
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
Harbor Day Teacher Appreciation Day
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%

day uh Portsmith peace treaty day those
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
are some of them that the governor shall
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
make those proclamations so um in that
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
list and many more um that is where this
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
is listed yes Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
reading that can we be sure that our
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee report has those listed in it
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
so that people who really deeply want
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
this can understand clearly why the vote
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
is going the way it is I will um be
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
happy to provide the representative a
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
copy of the report so you can see
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
it representative Barton uh yes thank
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair first of all I in
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
intend to vote no on
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
itl reading the um the uh proposed bill
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
it only seeks to amend RSA 3 and
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
includeed within RSA 3 doesn't mention
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 4 at all and uh in in reading the
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
bill I believe um it it doesn't give
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
anything to the government it's just
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's embodied within the statute with
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
those other days that are listed in RSA
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
3 um so and I'm okay with that so I'll
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
be voting no against the motion for itl
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%

hearing and everything it just seems to
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
me that if this group of individuals is
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%

00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay the time being 9:30 I'm going to
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%

barington and
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
straford um
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
I hope everybody has a couple of copies
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
in front of you the the the amendment to
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
456 that or that replaces it in its
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
entirety was originally
 
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.270 align:start position:0%
entirety was originally
7218

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
7218
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's the one we will be basically
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
talking to um you will also see that
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
908h that's we will also discuss I
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
identical with the
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
exception of lines 11 through 7 uh 18 on
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
the page two and the reason for that is
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
I continually attempted to make sense
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
out of those lines on 721 and convince
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
myself they
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
were not good so I had a little bit of a
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
redraft done there so anyway we'll speak
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
to uh we'll kind of speak to both of
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
them as we go here um but let me just
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
tell you about the what we've done um
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
the first part on page
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
one of the amendment line 14 we've
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
changed the an annual membership
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
allowance from 20 up to
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
$75 simply done I'm guessing that hasn't
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
been done in a few decades so we've uh
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
upped that uh we also changed on line 15
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
the word fee to does because um
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
that is what these are these are dues
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
and to make it consistent throughout the
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
fees in line
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
18 through
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
22 that would prohibit any of those du's
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
members uh du's membership money from
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
being used to pay a lobbyist or lobbyist
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
organization it does make specifically
 
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
clear that any such member or
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
Association or member of Association uh
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
can still record a position they just
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
cannot have a lobbyist uh use any of
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
that money for a
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
lobbyist line 24 through
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
26 is uh Pro what I consider probably
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
the most important part of this and that
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
takes the money that currently goes to
 
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.149 align:start position:0%
takes the money that currently goes to
the

00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
nhma uh from a line item that sometimes
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
at least I know in my town is buried
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
deep within the um
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
budget and brings it out and in the case
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
of my town barington would require a
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article now the reason
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
for that of course in my estimate or my
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
idea is full
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
transparency and I'll give you a few
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
examples when I contacted my
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
administrator who is a fantastic Town
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
Administrator by the way um I asked him
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
I said what is the amount of money that
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
we pay to the
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
nhma and it was somewhere in the $9,500
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
range um don't quote me on that exact
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
number but uh for example in this last
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
just yesterday we had a couple warn
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
articles that came up in my town that
 
00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
articles that came up in my town that
were

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and around
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
$10,000 so I think it's um it's worthy
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
of our citizens being allowed to vote on
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
this specific issue I want to also make
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
it clear that this is not an affront to
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
the nhma uh during my time on uh as
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
chairman last term of Municipal and
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
County um I will say I had a fairly good
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
actually a very good relationship with
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
31 talks about uh the association not
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
being allowed to State a definitive
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
position I will say that even though
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's in this it's I think
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that somebody can still
 
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that somebody can still
give

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
testimony and if the listener is paying
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
attention we prob probably be able to
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
get a good idea of where they actually
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
stand on it we had in a meeting not too
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
long ago the Commissioner of Agriculture
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
I Believe come in without his uh any
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a card and testified as an
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
individual so you don't have to
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily make a definitive position
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
to get your your point AC uh point
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
across then the last part was what I was
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
talking about at the beginning and that
 
00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
talking about at the beginning and that
was

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh lines starting at a line
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
11 on page
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
two and again I I just I had to redo it
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
for for clarity reasons I just didn't
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
think uh it read very well and basically
 
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that is um
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
that you cannot
 
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.190 align:start position:0%
that you cannot
co-mingle

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
co-mingle
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
funds and you have to segregate them and
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
actually have physically uh separate
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
purposes so with that I hopefully I've
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
explained what the complete Amendment
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
does and certainly happy to attempt to
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
representative and you will provide us a
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
pink card at some point absolutely thank
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
you um further questions representative
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
Wade thank you Mr chair um so in here it
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
it states uh I'll just do page one I
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
think it's in a couple places but page
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
one line 18 no part of the annual
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
membership dues shall be used to pay a
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or an organization that pays
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
part or all of the salary of a
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and then um it
 
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.669 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and then um it
also

00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
states that uh pardon me one moment
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh it it it states the position of the
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
financial separation where funds would
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
have to be separated if they were used
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
to be paid for lobbying
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
purposes however if if we're
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
specifically referring to the New
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association in this
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
instance wouldn't that you know it it's
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
it states that they cannot be used to
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
pay an
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
organization that pays even part of the
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
the funding for lobbyist so wouldn't
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
that Encompass even if the funds were
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
separated it's still the New Hampshire
 
00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.549 align:start position:0%
separated it's still the New Hampshire
Municipal

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
organization um in in that case so my my
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
question is does does that prohibit the
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association from
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
paying a lobbyist even if the funds were
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
separated as long as the money for
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
paying the lobbyists is not taxpayers
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
money or is specifically raised for that
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
purpose does that make
 
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.710 align:start position:0%
purpose does that make
sense

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
um well in in line 18 it says that no
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
part of the annual membership dues shall
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
be used to pay a lobbyist okay um or pay
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
an organization that pay as part of or
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
all of the salary of a lobbyist so it's
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying in regards to
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
financial separation but if you look at
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
318 is Town officer associations that's
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
not the section of the rsas that address
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
24 it's odd but the nhma has their
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
own RSA okay within
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
our okay thank you representative rille
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
representative uh for for for taking my
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
question I just want to make sure I
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
understand that this clearly so the
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
intent of the the amendment is so that
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
tax payer derived revenue is not used
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
for lobbying but it does not preclude
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
from raising revenue from other sources
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
that they could then choose to dedicate
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
to lobbying it just can't be taxpayer
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
money is that correct I wish I could
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
have stated it exactly like just did but
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
yes that's exactly it thank you uh
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
follow if I may Mr chairman thank you uh
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for for taking the second
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
question so what would you believe that
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
um since getting involved in in local
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
politics uh some 15 years ago I get
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
repeated complaints from constituents
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
that part of their local property tax
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
dollars that goes to the new New
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association is used
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
to Lobby against their personal position
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
so their own money is being used to
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
Lobby against their their
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
position I would absolutely believe that
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
I've I've heard that um I'm not as
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
active as some people are in their local
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh Town boards or whatever but I've
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
certainly heard that yes thank you m
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative further questions
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative wall thank you very much
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and giving this to
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
us today representa terot what I'm
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
trying to understand having been a
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
select in my
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
community how do we pay the municipal
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
Association our dues and figure out how
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
much of it goes to a lobbyist how does
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association separate every
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
Community because it's my understanding
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
from testimony that if not all almost
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
all communities and locations in New
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire belong to the New Hampshire
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association how how do they
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
separate each community because I know
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
you you testified just now as to how
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
much your community pays in mine pays
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
just a couple hundred our dues based on
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
our population in our communities how do
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
you do
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
that um or how do they do it just so you
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
know my my hearing after 40 years in the
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
cockpit isn't great so I was
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think I heard what you were asking
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
um how do they separate it is that
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
basically let I I think it would be if I
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
can paraphrase how how would the
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
community know um whether their money is
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
being used for lobbying purposes um is
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
that what the if that's a question
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
that's uh when we talked about uh lines
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
24 for 26 that's exactly the issue I'm
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
trying to uh one of the issues I'm
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
trying to change and that would require
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
in your town as with mine your Madbury I
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
believe would require a separate War
 
00:31:57.919 --> 00:31:59.029 align:start position:0%
believe would require a separate War
curent

00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
curent
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
article um on the ballot so instead of
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
whatever your town currently pays as a
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
light item that's somewhere in the
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
budget that nobody ever sees now it
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
would be required to bring that out as a
 
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.950 align:start position:0%
would be required to bring that out as a
warrant

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
article does that help or did I
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
not answer paraphrase you're part way
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
there only part part way
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
there um how does the municipal
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
association with 200 some odd people and
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
people um entities paying dues how do
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
they know how much time any lobbyist is
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
giving to any particular Community
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
because certain issues affect more some
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
communities more than others and they
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
try to take a broad spectrum as to what
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be most beneficial or
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
detrimental to a community how do they
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
actually do the figuring or how can
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
they all right let me take a look at
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
this again I want to make sure sure I
 
00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
this again I want to make sure sure I
answer

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
correctly all right so on line two
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
through five on page two I I hope it
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
explain exps it there says no membership
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
due shall be contributed to or paid to
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
an organization that pays part of all
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
its salary of a lobbyist but nothing in
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
the section shall be construed to Pro
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
prohibit an individual public official
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's the same language that's up on
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
the town offices Association page and
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
basically um the only CH in in that
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph the only change we're making
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
is for the nhma because they do have
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
their own RSA is by put
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
the uh requirement to put basically
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
their pay onto the ballot how they
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
segregate those funds is talked about
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
down in 15 through 17 on there the
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
sources may be used for that purpose if
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
the other funds are not co-mingled it's
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
going to be up to the N
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
nhma uh to to figure out and have their
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
separate accounts um to for the to to
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that the funds are not
 
00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:29.069 align:start position:0%
make sure that the funds are not
co-mingled

00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
co-mingled
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
does that make sense no no follow up you
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
follow up I'm gonna just let that rest
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
for a minute or two or three um as it is
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
now any official or any
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
Town um person official or resident can
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
already come up here and
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
testify corre any Bill
 
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.829 align:start position:0%
testify corre any Bill
anyway

00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
um so even though my town for example
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
want to do something
 
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
that through the municipal Association
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
for example when we get legal advice on
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
water issues someone in our town may not
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
agree with that they can come up anyway
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
already and testify but you've got it in
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
here that that's part of your Amendment
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
yes that I can answer very very
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
specifically and the reason is we've
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on these bills
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
before and a matter of fact couple of
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
the emails that we got sent to us on
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
this where the the individuals have St
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to disallow our members
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
from coming up and testifying that's not
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
true and that why we specifically put
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
that in there to make that perfectly
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
clear so there's
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
no uh no question on that one we're
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
making it perfectly clear it doesn't
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
prevent I don't know what position you
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
hold in your town maybe nothing if
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
you're a selectman it does not prohibit
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
you from coming up here as a selectman
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
of your town and stating a position we
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
support one of the other issues I think
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
you Pro as a Small Town versus somebody
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
from say
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester totally two different animals
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
not unlike what we just went through
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
with our uh straford County uh
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner where we finally brought
 
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.790 align:start position:0%
commissioner where we finally brought
our

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners uh into districts for the
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
first time because we had for the past
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
forever a couple of the
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
Cities really determining our three
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and excluding the input of
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
the very small um and Northern parts of
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
our County so I think it's kind of along
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
that same issue here this does not
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
prevent you from coming up um and
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
testifying and a matter of fact as I was
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
driving up here this morning I even
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
thought about maybe maybe and I'm sure
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
that NH nhma is not going to like this
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
but maybe um where there are
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
disagreements within when you guys all
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
vote in in your NH nhma
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
meetings maybe you guys maybe everybody
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the state needs to do something
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
similar to what we did in straford
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
County where we go wait a minute here
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be a segment of
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
nhma that focuses on these towns the
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
cities this so you can get your
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
different positions uh brought
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
before hearings you know final final
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
Final one final one thank you I'm going
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
right back to the division um of
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
salaries and such um we've heard
 
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from the New Hampshire
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association that how on Earth
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
divide among all the communities and
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
locations cuz heart's location places
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
like that in the North part of the state
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
um how how do you know how much time a
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyist puts on a particular issue that
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
may affect more towns than others how do
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
you put a price tag on that I would say
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
that would be an excellent question for
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
probably somebody else who's going to
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
come testify against this I have no idea
 
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.349 align:start position:0%
come testify against this I have no idea
thank

00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Vergo thank
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you uh
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative for for for taking my my
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
question as somebody who's really
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
reasonably uh well aware of of the the
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
goods and services that the New
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association uh
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
provides to to
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
communities it it sounds to me like the
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
purpose of the the amendment is so that
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
local dues derived from taxpayer
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
money goes to support the New Hampshire
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
municiple Association activities that
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
are not lobbying and and by way of
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
example if you're not familiar with the
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association um
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
they provide legal services so um I've
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
been on the budget committee on and off
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
for over over a decade and if we have a
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
legal question um we can submit the
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
question to to New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
Association and and their attorneys on
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
staff you know weigh it over and they
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know they they they give you some
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
some opinions to help to help guide you
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
they provide uh training for elected
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
officials so if you newly get elected to
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
a budget committee um or a El board or a
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
trustee of the trust funds Etc um they
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
offer classes and books that go through
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
the rsas that are pertinent to those
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
offices and what your Authority is and
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
what your Authority is not and and and
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
how to operate and what you're supposed
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
to do and and I think the purpose and
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong because this is
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
my question I think the purpose of the
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is to allow those monies
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
collected from taxpayers to fund all of
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
those activities
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
but to not fund direct lobbying so that
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
if the if the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
Association wants to Lobby the
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislature they have to get those funds
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
those revenues somewhere else so the
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
accounting is simple all the DU go to
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
non- lobbying activities and other
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue could go to lobbying
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct representative
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
that again perfectly stated um I would
 
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.990 align:start position:0%
that again perfectly stated um I would
add

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
that yes they the other services they
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
provide um again when I was M Municipal
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
in County last year they a lot of that
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
stuff was provided and worked very well
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
with them correct I will add the only
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
caveat on that would be that now that
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
money collected from towns for those
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
purpos you stated other than
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
lobbying would be required on an a
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
warrant article yeah that that part I I
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
understand I agree oh I'm sorry m
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up yeah on on that part
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
I'm crystal clear and and and agree I
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea thank you
 
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.630 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea thank you
representative

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
sure any further questions
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
representative P thank you when we're
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
talking about keep using the phrase
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
lobbying lobbying lobbying in my
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
perspective when we talk about lobbying
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
it's we have lobbyists obviously all
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
over the place around here they're
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
always coming in they're giving opinions
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay and then we as the elected
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
officials take what they have to say and
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
then make our decision this feels like a
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
major overreach in micromanaging of our
 
00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:34.349 align:start position:0%
major overreach in micromanaging of our
towns

00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
and why I don't understand the why of
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
why we're doing that if you in your own
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
personal Town don't have an issue with
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
it which I think that's the minority
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
then do a warrant article in your town
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
why are you trying to control the entire
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
State it's just seems very
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
strange excellent
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
question this addresses
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funded lobbying yes there are
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyists up here all the time I I mean
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of them I don't know how many
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
lobbyists we have 100 maybe more most of
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
those are funded privately through law
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
firms um business industry Association
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
those aren't taxpayer money this
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
addresses taxpayers money plain and
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
simple so I'm a taxpayer and I don't
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
feel that this represents my my opinions
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
and positions that's my that's what I'm
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that um you know we
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
need to hear all perspectives this feels
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
greatly like a suppression of trying to
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
suppress different opinions and just
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
make it harder make it harder for cities
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
and towns so why not I feel like we're
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
trying to over micromanage our Selectmen
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
and our Mayors and all these elect other
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
elected officials that are trying to do
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
their job with this legislation not sure
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
I heard a question in there but um I
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
would say that well how is it not
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
suppressing information that's my
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
question I would say you and everybody
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
else will have the ability to
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
vote your perspective on this I mean
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
that's what it comes down to I mean
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to vote here in the
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
committee it's going to go to the house
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
floor if it passes it's going to go to
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate it's going to go to the
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
governor's nest and if everything passes
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
then your town you will still be be able
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
to vote whether or not to
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
um give money to the um nhma or whatever
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
so and so can you oh I'm
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up yes it is thank you can
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
you specify exactly which lines relate
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
to a town doing a Warren article in here
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
yeah uh line 25 it talks about the
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body uh in a in most towns
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
that would be through the Warren article
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on cities I believe
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
that would be through the council but um
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
I know in towns it's it's through the
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
Warren article process I'm sure I don't
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
know where you're from representative
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
but like I say yesterday on our ballot
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
we probably
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
had 20 25 warrant articles ranging from
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
a low of $5,000 up to $100,000
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
individuals warn articles that our
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
Town's citizens voted on U and I will
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
say unfortunately every one of them
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
passed but I mean that's
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess my
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
answer thank you does this Amendment
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
affect other associations or is this
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
nhma um it it affects the town Officers
 
00:44:59.309 --> 00:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%

most of us have just come through town
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
meeting and we voted last night on our
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
budget for the year ahead um State runs
 
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
on a different fiscal year from the way
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
we do we don't know what issues are
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
going to come up from year to year that
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
affect our communities that the New
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association will be
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
working on how on Earth does a community
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
budget an appropriate sum of money for a
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
lobbyist not knowing what kind of hours
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
may have to go into it for the year
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
ahead when we have no idea what bills
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
are coming up how much time we'll have
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
to go into it what communities are
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
affected I I I can't see how we can
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
develop a formula for that
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
not are you saying that mad Berry now
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
will have to hire its own
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
lobbyist I I'm not maybe I don't
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
understand the question um we are my
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
community and the communities I
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
represent um our members of the New
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association if we
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
have to separate from that and hire a
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyist we can't possibly project
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
what's going to be happening and that
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
type of instance for what bills are
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
coming up how many bills how few the
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
municipal Association sometimes has a
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
whole lot of bills before the
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
legislature how does anybody develop a
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
formula for that I'm not sure if formula
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
is needed is isn't the enemy isn't your
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
dues already based
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
on uh the population of your
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
town okay if the dues for the municipal
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
Association are based on the population
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
you are correct in that um but that's
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
the dues but you want to separate the
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
lobbyists out from that is that
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
correct we want to separate the funds
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
used for lobbying out from that correct
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
and then put it through a Warren article
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's where I'm going
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
with it you separate the lobbyist out
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
from what we're paying from our legal
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
advice and this that and the other from
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association but if again
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
we have no idea what bills will be
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
coming up we have no idea what the
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
lobbyist may need to put in for hours or
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost I I can't see
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
how this is workable thank you I I
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
believe we heard last week or last time
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting in this
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on a similar bill that the
 
00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on a similar bill that the
nh's

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
nh's
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
um budget is $2.3
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
million something tells me that they
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to do what you're
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
this will be the
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
last Point uh representative Ville thank

bills that they believe May or may you
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%

the legislature is proposing is there
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill that proh
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from tracking that and
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%

representing maram County and opposes
 
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.230 align:start position:0%
representing maram County and opposes
the

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and members
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Al representative
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
Alvin C uh represent lden and seven
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
other towns in a float teral District
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
I'm uh opposed to this when I went to uh
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
vote yesterday after I voted I was
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
called as sign by uh the fire chief and
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
he was uh really up at Arms about about
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
because and he says this amendment makes
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
it worse and after reading it I think it
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
does the U problem comes from the fact
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
that the uh towns and cities pay to join
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
either nhma or other groups so that they
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
can have
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
somebody to review the nearly th000
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
bills we do every year and see which
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
ones have an effect on on their group
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
and there are several different groups
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
he is involved with fire issues he knows
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
he can come in here on his own and
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
testify but while he's here then he's
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
not available to respond on emergency
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
calls should there be
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
any and his concern is that he wants
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
somebody to be able to speak for him and
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
say whether or not they f a bill um
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
particularly on the uh the original Bill
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
where it says uh providing information
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
shall not include promoting or opposing
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
or directly directly or indirectly any
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and just the nature of of uh
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislation it makes it very difficult
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
to provide a statement that does
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
not uh provide some indication of how
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
you stand on a bill whether you're in
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
favor it or not and in particular if
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
there are major
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
issues um so that said it's just a
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh while the town is paying money for
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
joining these
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
organizations there is a purpose for
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
them joining the organizations and they
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
want that help and that includes sending
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist to come visit us or any of
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
the Committees to speak on behalf of the
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
members of the of that group thank you
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll take questions if there are
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
any thank you representative verville
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for for
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
coming and taking my
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
question would you believe that it would
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
be possible that there would be an issue
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
topic X in which uh the members of a
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
community were divided on uh agree or
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
disagree say on a on a 6040 split
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
so 60% of the residents of a community
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a a good idea and and 40%
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad idea and so if the
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money is used to lobby for the
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
60% then the tax the taxes collected
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
from 40% of the population are now being
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
used against their interest would you
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
would you agree that that's that's
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
possible that's possible yes thank you
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
and it's one of those things where um
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
just about every issue that comes to a
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
town there's some people who are opposed
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
to it and some people are in favor of it
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
how the mix is whether 6040 or some
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
other followup so I don't disagree with
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
that the difference is at the local
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
level they're not hiring a lobbyist to
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
to get something done right it's the
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
communities aren't always 100% unified
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
but do do you think it's appropriate
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you use taxpayer money against the
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
interest of the taxpayer that that that
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
provided the cash uh not completely on
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
that and uh what I'll say on that
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
is while that is an issue I don't think
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
this bill or this
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
amendment corrects that in a suitable
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
way thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
further questions your
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
microphone um I have one um in your
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
community representative does uh does
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
your community vote on uh
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
individually or separately on your um
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
fire district or your town uh
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
purchasing um services from the um the
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs Association
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
or uh no it's all lumped into one
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
budget I can understand the part in here
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
of separating that out so that the
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
voters of the town can see what part of
 
00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
their budget that is going to uh these
 
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
organizations for
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
lobbying uh thank you so um if I can
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
paraphrase then you are saying you're
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
okay with um an individual vote by the
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
town whether to have the services or
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
not that might be a useful thing and I
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
think that might be a good idea for a
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
new uh legislation for next year to uh
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
bring the idea
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
up uh thank you if you if you had that
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
vote um
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
or what would be the significant
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
difference between um
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
deciding whether to uh contribute with
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to that organization or
 
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.829 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to that organization or
not

00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
what what changes from this bill to what
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
Bill the the main part in here and what
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
the uh people at least in my town say is
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
that it's uh preventing them from
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
speaking or preventing them from saying
 
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
actually what they think will help or
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
hinder them in terms of what the
 
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.270 align:start position:0%
hinder them in terms of what the
legislation

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
is uh thank you but you are aware on
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
whatever line it was that said anyone
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
can speak
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
at any time in existing law and it's
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
reinforced here that nothing in this
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
section shall be construed to prohibit
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
any individual member from an
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
association from recording a position
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%

could get here but even still the
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
several hours that he would have to be
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.109 align:start position:0%
 
bines

00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
Burns good morning welcome to ledge

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and we are here
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
this morning in opposition to the
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment to house bille
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
456 the conversation this morning has
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
been a a little confusing I'm going to
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
speak to my understanding of the bill um
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
try to address some of the um items that
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
have been raised here this morning and
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
am absolutely happy to take questions as
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
well at the end this morning a lot of
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
the conversation has been around the New
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association as is
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
typically the case with bills like this
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
that are filed year after year um but
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that this
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill affects a lot more than just the
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
there are many or organizations in the
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that represent
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
different groups of local officials that
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
collect dues to perform the functions
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
that they have and these organizations
 
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:39.799 align:start position:0%
typically Pro provide an array of
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
services right so they typically provide
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
both the education side and they do some
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
level of advocacy at the state
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislature some of these associations
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
Advocate on their own behalf so perhaps
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
their president is the advocate of the
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
association but many others higher
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
outside lobbyists um nhma and
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
organizations structured more similar to
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
us we have in-house lobbyists who are
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
employees of the association who are
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
typically individuals who have expertise
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
in Municipal issues so that we are both
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
able to Advocate and to provide the
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
other services that the members um need
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
so for example I'm a lawyer I've been
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
Association for over a decade I have the
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
ability to serve as an advocate I have
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to provide Prov legal advice
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
and guidance to members as well as to
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
run the
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
association the way that I read this
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill is it really does two things it
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
prohibits three specific Statewide
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
organizations representing local
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
officials from taking positions on
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
legislation it separately puts new
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
restrictions on all the other
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
associations that are not listed in 318
 
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.510 align:start position:0%
associations that are not listed in 318
and

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
318a puts new restrictions on them that
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
lobbying with public funds which for
 
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.510 align:start position:0%
lobbying with public funds which for
those

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
associations may be all of the funds
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
that they receive or collect so I can't
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
I I won't speak for other associations
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that the majority of
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
their funding comes from public funds
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
that are paid by the municipalities or
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
the local officials who members of that
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
Association that prohibition or that new
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
restriction created in the amendment at
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
the end on page two could entirely
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from any kind of advocacy
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
activity on their behalf or on that
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
association's behalf so I'll let them
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
speak to that but it's a pretty Broad
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
associations so with respect to NH
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
the new language proposed to
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
318a would prohibit us from taking a
 
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
position on
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
legislation but I also heard when the
 
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
introduced that because we could still
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
provide information to the
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislature legislators could sort of
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
read between the lines to know what
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
position we are EX ing when we're
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
speaking to that
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
legislation I struggle to understand
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
then why the prohibition on taking a
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
position is necessary if we can come
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
here and provide the information as we
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
already do on behalf of our members then
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
why the ban on speech why the ban on two
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
words oppose and support if it's clear
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
from the information we're providing
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
that that's the position that we're
 
01:00:54.559 --> 01:00:57.190 align:start position:0%
that that's the position that we're
taking

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
the bill would also then override Our
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
member adopted policies so I've spoken
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
to this committee before about how every
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
two years nhma has a member driven
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
legislative policy process our members
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
serve on policy committees they review
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
our legislative policies they ultimately
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
meet in a town meeting style group they
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
vote by a super majority whether to
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
adopt the policies proposed or whether
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
to make amendments whether to strike Etc
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
and so by prohibiting us from taking a
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
position this would be the state
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature overriding a
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
local organization's process for taking
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
positions on
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislation another aspect of what this
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
amendment does is instead of allowing
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
nhma which again is a private
 
01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:50.269 align:start position:0%
nhma which again is a private
independent

01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
organization instead of allowing us to
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
represent our members at the legislature
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
we become more of an instrumentality of
 
01:02:02.269 --> 01:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
the state we're restricted to providing
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
information but we can't do what we've
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
been sent here by our members to do
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
which is to take positions on
 
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and to explain why we have
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
those positions why we have the um the
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
great interest in the legislation why
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's positive why it's not what the
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
concerns are so that is a deep concern
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
about what the amendment to 318a does as
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
to the seg ation of funds I've already
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
spoken to how that could be a complete
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
ban on advocacy for many of these
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
organizations who are 100% or perhaps
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
primarily funded by public funds through
 
01:02:37.319 --> 01:02:38.710 align:start position:0%
primarily funded by public funds through
their

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
dues if there is a transparency argument
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
here um a transparency argument with
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
respect to the use of public funds I
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
would say two
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
things one the provision in and I'm
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
looking at I suppose they're the same
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
lines I'm looking at at the new
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I saw this morning so the
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
0908 looking at the new the language in
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
20 line 25 and 26 at the bottom of the
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
page that language doesn't change
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
anything municipalities already have an
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
obligation or legislative bodies are
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
already required to appropriate the
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
money to pay these dues whether they're
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
in the budget or in a separate warrant
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
article the vote to approve is an
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation by the legisl
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
body some towns already have separate
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
warrant articles for nh's dues it's
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
always been their right to do that
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
individual voters 25 or more can
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
petition to put it on the warrant and
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
make it a separate warrant article
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's been done as well there is
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing prohibiting
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities from doing it that
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
way the other thing that I would mention
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
two other things that I would mention
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
just last year this committee
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
recommended a bill that would require
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office to have
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
digital and online filing process for
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
lobbyist reporting and that bill was
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
signed into law by the governor so if
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
there's concerns about increased
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
transparency for the amount of funds
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
that are being used to Lobby that bill
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
is actually going to help with increased
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
transparency because nhma already
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
reports the amount of money that we
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
spend on lobbying it's they're already
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
publicly available reports that anyone
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
can look up and pull but but when that
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
digital reporting goes through I think
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
transparency will be even more improved
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm not just talking about nhma I
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
think it will be improved for lobbying
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
and general the final point I want to
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
make is I think we
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
have a bit of a red herring with the
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
argument that only in the situation of
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
organizations like nhma are public funds
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
being used to Lobby the reality is there
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
are many private sector organizations
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
and entities that are part of Municipal
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
and state budgets they receive taxpayer
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
funds energy companies law uh lawyers
 
01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:05.799 align:start position:0%
firms other private entities that
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
receive taxpayers funds all the time and
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
they would not be restricted in any way
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
by this legislation they would not be
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
touched in any way by this legislation
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
so they would have no further
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions on their lobbying but nhma
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
and similar groups would have
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions on their
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
lobbying for these reasons NH as opposed
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
to the legislation I even thought to
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
myself when I read the bill that one of
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
the Curious results of this legislation
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
would be that if nhma was no longer
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
lobbying under RSA chapter 15 and we
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
were only providing information there
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
would actually be less public reporting
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
because we would no longer be filing our
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
public lobbying reports with the
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State we would no longer
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
fall under that statute which seems to
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
be an odd consequence of legislation
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
that so often has been surrounded by
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
conversations about transparency and use
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
of public funds so for these reasons
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
nhma is opposed to the bill we're
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to how it affects our
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
organization we're opposed to how it
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
affects the members we're opposed to how
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
it affects similarly situated
 
01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
organizations who Advocate on their
 
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
members behalfs thank
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony are
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions that here thank you for coming
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
in and giving that concise summary
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
question I think I heard you say this
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
that even if a town did a warrant
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
article to pay their dues that wouldn't
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
matter the bill still wouldn't allow the
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
activities is that correct so even if so
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
if this if this
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
318a once our dues were appropriated by
 
01:06:52.039 --> 01:06:53.029 align:start position:0%
318a once our dues were appropriated by
that

01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
municipality we still would only Beed ow
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
to provide information to the
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
legislature not to
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
Lobby So when you say oh sorry can I do
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
a okay when you say provide information
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
what did that what would that look like
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
you would come in and give information
 
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
but you wouldn't you couldn't say oppose
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
or against is that what you're
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
saying it's unclear and I think that our
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
staff would be concerned about being
 
01:07:23.799 --> 01:07:25.710 align:start position:0%
staff would be concerned about being
accused

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
accused
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
of taking positions so for
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
example I'm here
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
today saying that I oppose the amendment
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
456 under this bill I couldn't say that
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
but if I listed out all the reasons that
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is negative and hurts
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities will I be accused of
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying of taking a position of
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
influencing a vote because of course
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
when I express serious concerns about a
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
I am indeed influencing a vote and I'm
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
doing it transparently there's nothing
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
hidden about it but could that be
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
construed to be illegal lobbying under
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
the bill I don't know and when we pass
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
legislation that is unclear to the
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
extent at which speech is prohibited or
 
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
allowed we chill speech and I would
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
suggest that that is very disturbing
 
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
especially in the context of a
 
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.110 align:start position:0%
especially in the context of a
legislative

01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
process PA up thank you um so the other
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
thing heard you say it sounds like if
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation were to pass nonprofits
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
such as yourself and other groups
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters Association Police
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
Association whatnot which I believe are
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofits would be suppressed but
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
for-profit entities law firms those
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
sorts of things would not be affected by
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
Okay re Wade uh thank you uh for taking
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
my question um so you you had mentioned
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
that uh a lot of towns and these these
 
01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.550 align:start position:0%
that uh a lot of towns and these these
smaller

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
organizations get all or vast majority
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
of their funds from state and local and
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
and dues like that so are there any
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
funds that nhma or these organizations
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
get that are not state or local I won't
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
speak for other organizations I will let
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
them speak for themselves nhma does have
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
some other funds that come through
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
sponsorships that would not
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
constitute local funds
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
um we do also have some other services
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
that have an extra fee on them but those
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
are paid by local
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
funds so it's a little unclear under
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment whether those would also
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
be funds that could not be used for
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
lobbying activity follow up um could you
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
give an approximate percentage of how
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
much of the budget comes from the dues
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and how much might come from those kinds
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
of sponsorships I believe and I don't
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
like to speak off the top of my head so
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
I'm so I'm giving you estimates based on
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
um what I what I recall I believe about
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
70% of our budget is dues but then
 
01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
another portion of the remaining 30
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
would include some of the trainings and
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
other events that we charge an extra fee
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
for which would be local funds um so
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's only a small portion at the end of
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
the day that would you could call
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
so-called private sector
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
funds last follow up last follow up um
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
so would it be fair to say that in the
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
event that you were not able to use any
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
of those dues on uh payments for
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying that you would just be unable
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
to afford uh lobbyists yes and I I think
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem with this idea of
 
01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
we'll just segregate out certain funds
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
for lobbying purposes you know segregate
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
out those so-called private sector funds
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
from the public sector funds the biggest
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
problem with that and I've said this
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
before in this committee is that we do
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
not know how much will be spent on
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
lobbying until after the at until the
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
end of a quarter right so I'm sure this
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee is aware that the way it works
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
is that you register annually with the
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office as a
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and then at the end of each
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
quarter you file a report that details
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
your revenues and expenses related to
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
lobbying so this idea that we could
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
segregate ahead of time the correct
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
amount of money when we don't know how
 
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
much time is going to be spent
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the session at the
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
legislature it's it's really not
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
practical and I think it sets us up for
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
violating the law inadvertently trying
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
to do it correctly but not knowing what
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
amount of funds will be spent on on
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
actual lobbying and that's deeply
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
problematic and that could also serve to
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
affect whether the association or other
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
associations can Lobby because they'll
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
have concerns about violating the
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
law rip
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
verbal thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
for coming and and and taking my my
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm going to assume that you
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
you heard some of my hypotheticals
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
earlier of a a 6040 split you know I can
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
imagine another hypothetical where um a
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
community is in favor of a particular
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation for whatever reason
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
and I can imagine that another Community
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
um would be opposed to it right so so
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
you've got a community a that's that's
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
for Community B that's against but the
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
association can only take one position
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
and so if a super majority takes a
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
position then you're using taxpayer
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
money to Lobby against their their
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
position position and in fact it could
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
be an entire community so doesn't that
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
become compelled speech with tax faay
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds right once I pay my dues
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
and you take a a position opposite of my
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
community's will isn't that compelled
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
speech against my will no I thank you
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
for that question our members understand
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
that when nhma lobbies at the
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
legislature we represent the New
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and they
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
understand that they as members Direct
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
the course of what the municipal
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
Association lobbies on through their
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
voting at our legislative policy
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
conference so and because they are local
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
officials they also have a deep
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
appreciation for the fact that in a
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
democratic process the majority rules as
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
far as what positions are taken or what
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes occur as part of the voting
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
process so no I do not see that issue in
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
the way that you've described we do at
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
times have indiv idual members have
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
their own individual positions on
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
specific legislation that's never been
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
an issue for the association it's never
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
been an issue for our relationship with
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
the members and we encourage them if
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
they have a different position or if
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
they have any position including on
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that doesn't fall within
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
nh's purview to Advocate on we encourage
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
them to come out and express their
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
position regardless of whether it
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
coincides with nh's position because we
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
believe that's their right to do that
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that more advocacy and more input is
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
better than less so no I I don't agree
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
with that categorization and our members
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely know that membership with the
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
municipal Association is voluntary and
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
if that they had a true and fundamental
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
disagreement with the association and
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the direction that we take that they
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to Simply leave
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association follow up if I
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
may thank you madam chair and and thank
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my my second question
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
because it and and it's not the question
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
I intend to ask but but you really you
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
brought something to light um to to
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
light for
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
me the the challenge is the dues is an
 
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
all-in number so would you believe that
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
I have a a majority of constituents that
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
love the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
Association the legal advice for the
 
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.110 align:start position:0%
Association the legal advice for the
training

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
Etc but yet I have a significant amount
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
of constituents that don't like the law
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
lobbying but it's all or none right they
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
can't they can't choose to divorce
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
themselves from the lobbying so if they
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
want the carrot they have to take the
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
stick um and and so that I guess that's
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
I guess that's the disconnect with how I
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
perceive it I I apologize it's not
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
really it's not really a question um I I
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't have a good form of a
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
question but that that's sort of where
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
I'm come and if you want to address that
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
I you know holistically that it'd be
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
fine thank you I think also say two
 
01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
things to that one is that I believe
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
there is a fundamental misunderstanding
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
at times between what nhma lobbies on
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
and what people perceive us to Lobby on
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
I know that I've said this this in this
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
committee before but I will say it again
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of our advocacy does one of
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
two things it argues against pushing
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
more cost down on taxpayers and it
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
argues against taking away the power
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
power of Voters at the local level right
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
so zoning mandates is one of the big
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
things we Lobby against and really at
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
its core that's a voter rights issue
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's a a argument to not take away the
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
ability of Voters to have their voice so
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
that's one thing I would say in response
 
01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
that's one thing I would say in response
to

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
that my other response is that as
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
recently as last year this legislature
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
was a member of the National Council of
 
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.270 align:start position:0%
was a member of the National Council of
state

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
legislatures that organiz ation lobbies
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
at the federal level for state
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislator who are its members and I am
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
certain that every single constituent in
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire doesn't
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
personally agree with every position
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
that that organization takes but the
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
legislature as the elected officials who
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
represent them believe that it's in
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
their interest to be a part of this
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
organization and that it does more good
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
than bad for you in your position as a
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
elected officials and that's a similar
 
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
corollary to nh's representation of
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in New Hampshire at
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
legislature thank you madam chair RI
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
Martin uh thank you madam chair very
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
simple question for you um are you aware
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
of any existing statutes that would
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise restrict speech even if it was
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
limited to taking a position on a bill
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
by lobbyist or an individual any other
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
statutes that restrict so certain just
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
restrict in general speech by other
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that would restrict um any any
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
speech that you would give testimony
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
we'll say specifically for position I'm
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
neither seeing no other questions thank
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
just to catch everyone up uh we have
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
three pink cards um I would ask we will
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
hear from all three um they've asked for
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
two minutes three minutes and three
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
minutes I am going to ask that uh we try
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
to keep questions uh to a minimum Andor
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
try to um make sure that our speakers
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
speak to ground that hasn't been trod on
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
um already um even if it's just standing
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
and saying I I concur um but uh I had
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated about an hour for this we've
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
gone the hour uh and I'd like unless we
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
want to jump into the afternoon here I
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move along but uh with that
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
I will call uh Kathy Stacy uh from New
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
counties welcome to legislative
 
01:19:23.199 --> 01:19:27.229 align:start position:0%
counties welcome to legislative
Administration

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kathy Stacy I am
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
the President of the New Hampshire
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and the
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County Register of Deeds
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
obviously I do concur with the uh
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh nhma just provided and
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that I do represent one of
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
the associations that would be affected
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
by this amendment uh we do uh Lobby we I
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
represent uh 10 counties and our our
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
issue obviously is if we do not have a
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
lobbyist representing our
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
organization we would have 10 separate
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
counties with individuals from those
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
counties having to come here to testify
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
on legislation which really is not
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
economically feasible it really isn't a
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
good way to spend taxpayer dollars you
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
know we you know obviously there's over
 
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
a th bills we do have a legislative
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
committee that meets every Friday we go
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
over all bills and we determine you know
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
positions that we're going to take
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's 89 members um and and obviously
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
we take very seriously what's happening
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
here in conquer and I think that uh we
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
are best served obviously by having a
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and we do have dues and it's
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
part of the county budget and I'm sure
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
all of you are aware because you're all
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
members of your county budget your
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
county delegation right so you're voting
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
the budget and you rely upon the
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that are are uh developed
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
by your uh executive committee and the
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
delegation chair and those are the
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
Committees that review what's happening
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
with the budget and um I I just would
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
just say that you know we do have
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
education advocacy we do do sponsorships
 
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
50% um of our sponsorships pay for um
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
lobbying 50% of that and um you know we
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
have Affiliates which you know obviously
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
every every County department whether
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's the nursing home which is one of
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
the biggest departments and the most
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
costly for the county and there's a lot
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
of legislation affecting that we come up
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
here because we want to protect the
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of our counties from push back
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
from you know whether it's reduction in
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
fees uh in you know in in increased fees
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and we think that we do a pretty good
 
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
job at that but this bill would not
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
permit us to do that we would not be
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
able to have a lobbyist which would mean
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
you would be
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
seeing could be 10 correction uh super
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
tants it could be 10 nursing home of you
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
know um um supervisors it just it it
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
would and as you say yourself we don't
 
01:22:06.189 --> 01:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
want to hear redundancy in in testimony
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
but obviously everybody would be coming
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
down because they would have to testify
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're protecting their
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers in their particular
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
County so we do oppose this bill and we
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
ask you to take that into
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you uh thanks for
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
keeping to your time limit um are there
 
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.149 align:start position:0%
keeping to your time limit um are there
any

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
questions I have a quick one um you you
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
have the um the Friday morning meeting I
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
think you said or the correct yeah um if
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
there is a county or two that uh chooses
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
not to agree with uh the consensus I
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
guess of of what to Lobby or what
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
position to take what happens then in
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
the past when we've had counties that
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
have had their own individual issues we
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
have not participated we have determined
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
that we are not going to come here in
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
lobby they can come and they can testify
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
themselves that's how we that's how our
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
organization handles it so it is a
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous decision or no decision yes
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
you seeing
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
none uh chair will call Dennis
 
01:23:16.199 --> 01:23:18.310 align:start position:0%
none uh chair will call Dennis
Shanahan

01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
Shanahan
 
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
nhma this you m
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
example of trotting over previous
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
testimony if they're representing in as
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
exactly uh and I will avoid that I did
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
provide some written testimony uh that
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
has similar uh similar thoughts as what
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
you've heard so far what I would like to
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
do in my very brief time is to provide a
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
perspective as an elected official uh on
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh on what the nhma does and how it does
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
it uh there's been a quite a bit of
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh under this amendment
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
who can sit in front of you and express
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
an opinion uh with a a statement that
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
well any elected official or appointed
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
official can come up specifically and
 
01:24:02.189 --> 01:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
provide their opinion on it uh and I
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
just like to kind of run through what
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
the DOA city council looks like uh we've
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
got nine members uh we've got a project
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
developer and a consultant with three
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
schoolage kids a production manager with
 
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
school age children full-time package
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
handler you should see here during the
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
Christmas season uh school age children
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh a professor lecturer a small business
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
owner with children a retired department
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
head from the shipyard and independent
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
contractor specializing in finished
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
carpentry an IT consultant a local
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
business owner who trains International
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
Gymnastics overseas uh and a retired
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
teacher so you think of that group
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's only a couple of us who can do
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
this and and I do
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
this fairly frequently
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
um the others though they don't really
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to be able to come
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
up and deal with the Thousand to 2,000
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
bills to even be able to digest them uh
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
and work their way through it so I think
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
it really is a to consider you can
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
simply replace uh the the the lobbyists
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
that come from the nhma with the
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
individual elected officials coming up
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
here never mind appointed officials I
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
kind of want my city manager to spend
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
his time down at his desk fixing things
 
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
getting the road clear dealing with uh
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
turmoil that's coming down from from
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
DC so that's kind of the the the how
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for a group of
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
elected officials so what is it we do to
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're representing the
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
will of the people when we're sitting
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
here in front of you uh there's been a
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh uh how we get to our
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
policies and I want to focus on that a
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
little bit so the DOA city council
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
reviews and aligns itself with the
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
policies and principles that guide the
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
work of the
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
nhma we put in a resolution in front of
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
the city council saying here's the
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
policies and
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
principles let's endorse them and in
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
some cases Sometimes some of those are
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
removed from endorsement and therefore
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
as their representative very careful to
 
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
go up and make sure that I don't uh
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
provide any endorsements to the ones
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
that the council has already turned down
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
very few of those the council adopts a
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the policies and
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
principles the development of those
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
policies and principles obviously
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
includes uh the the members and
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
representatives of the nhma uh there are
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
three different Committees of uh at
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
least a dozen people when their work is
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
done over the course of the summer every
 
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
other year uh policy conference is
 
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.189 align:start position:0%
other year uh policy conference is
conven

01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
conven
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
and every member all 234 members or more
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh are are invited to come in and be a
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
delegate and to vote on and pass these
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
policies and principles this is coming
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
from the bottom up I feel when I sit in
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
front of a group that I am speaking for
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
my constituents I do recognize that many
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
of our decisions that we make don't have
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
unanimous support that there is a 6040 a
 
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
7030 we're going to work on a budget and
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
vote on in the next couple of weeks and
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that the the citizenry
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
are split there's a 51% and a 49% pro
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
and con that's how we do representative
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
democracy to allow the representatives
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
to come up in front of a a group like
 
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
yourself and bring the voice of the
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
people with it so the this allows the
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
opinions and perspectives of our
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
citizens to flow through our elected
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
officials and it gives a clear mandate
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
to nhma and what to speak for as the
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
voice so in the end when we appear in
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
front of it we are we are bringing the
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
the will and the input of our
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
constituents with it and an interference
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
to that would be removing the the the
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
ability of nhma uh to speak for the
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
people so bottom
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
line I'll paraphrase this as the nhma is
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
a lobbying organization they represent a
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
special interest group that special
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
interest group are the citizens of New
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's us all of us are
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
represented by the nhma we may not
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
always agree with every policy and
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
principle but the process gets us to a
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
point where those are overwhelmingly
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
accepted uh by the folks that uh that
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
have an impact on it uh so with that
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude my comments address any
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
questions and again thank you for
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony this morning

that new corks crew sidewalk off of
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
Portland avator um I was the first to to
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
bring that to the city manager's
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
attention I appreciate it the engineer
 
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:36.920 align:start position:0%

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
we can move along good to know um do you
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
mind just describing the uh the
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
challenges it took for you to come here
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
today as an individual as opposed to a
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
lobbyist um well I'm one of the
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
fortunate ones the retired guy uh so I
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
my schedule can be pretty open and uh it
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
has filled up quite a bit in the last
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
couple years and in fact just to make
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
sure for for due diligence and
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
transparency I was fortunate enough to
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
be uh elected as the chair of the nhma
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh board of directors you know in
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
addition to being the chair of uh of the
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
the coast board of directors uh so for
 
01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
me it's it's not that much of a
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
challenge hence I take every opportunity
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
I can uh I think of council Lindsay
 
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
Williams uh the the professor lecturer
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
two kids small business owner uh
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
definitely a struggle for her to
 
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
consistently be able to to come up here
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
and speak to us and I feel that the
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
process that the nhma has in place very
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
well represents her interest as the is
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
represented the will of the
 
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:42.040 align:start position:0%

Dave Karin um I hope that's right or
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
Karan um
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
asking for two three minutes and opposes
 
01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.629 align:start position:0%
asking for two three minutes and opposes

[Music]

01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you Mr chairman uh good morning
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Dave Karen the Town
 
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
Administrator for the town of dairy and
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
also on the board of directors ofn New
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire minicipal Association I
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony to you last evening
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
I will not repeat that but uh just to
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
summarize and try to provide some
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity uh I've been a Town
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
Administrator in the state for 44 years
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
and during various stents I've been on
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
the nhma board of directors for over 20
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience we've never had
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
a concern from a governing body of a New
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipality questioning the
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
propriety of lobbying because that's one
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
of the main Services we request and
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
itate to perform on our behalf and it's
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
very important to think back to the
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
process with both Margaret and Dennis
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
said we are a democratic process we have
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
a legislative policy Conference of which
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
any member which are all 234 communities
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
in the state are members in h they can
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
participate in that process to determine
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
what the legislative positions will be
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
our attendance there is about 80 it's
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
onethird of our membership and seeing
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
through various Town meetings I I put
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
that participation rate against any town
 
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
meeting in the state how do we get to
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
those recommendations which those 234
 
01:31:20.669 --> 01:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
communities can't have an opportunity to
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
voice on is that we have three separate
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
committees so like like budget
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
committees that look at different areas
 
01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.510 align:start position:0%
committees that look at different areas
General

01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
General
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
Administration uh finance and then we
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
have environmental policies all those
 
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
are 60 people one quarter of our
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
association participates in that process
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
so you can see it's a very Democratic
 
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
process so I don't want to make Margaret
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
use a word salad but when when nhma
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
comes up here they say NH May opposes
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
the bill what they actually are saying
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
is that NH May on behalf of the director
 
01:31:58.270 --> 01:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
of our 234 towns and cities oppose or
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
support this bill now you have the rest
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
of my testimony but I must confess some
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
confusion regarding lobbyists what I
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
understand from the testimony today is
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
that if nhma comes up here and doesn't
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
State a position on a bill but either
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates or exols the virtues of a bill
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
or wants the consequences but doesn't
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
actually say they for oppose then I
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
presume that's not to be lobbying well
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
extoling the virtues or warning the
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
consequences without stating a clear
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
position is essentially a distinction
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
without a
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
difference we pay these people to
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
represent us I love you guys but I can't
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
be here every day of the week that's why
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
we collectively subscribe to nhma the
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
dairy Town Council has been a member
 
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
forever to make sure they carry through
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
our policies voting on so hear Municipal
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
voices this legislation does not place a
 
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
gag order on municipalities to testify
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
but that's the Practical implication
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
because we have work to do at home I've
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
got a $55 million Municipal Corporation
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
with 250 employees to manage and I or my
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
nor my staff we can't be here every day
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
about these issues
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
so respectfully this is the wrong venue
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
if you believe that your citizens are
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
not well served by nhma they should be
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
speaking with their governing bodies and
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
advocating for the governing bodies not
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
included in their budget this seems to
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
be a lot of very respectfully this seems
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of legislative
 
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
gymnastics to address an issue which is
 
01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
not an issue finally if you go back to
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
the original legislation which was
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
crafted by the state legislature 64
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
years ago it already put guard rails on
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
nh's advocacy before leg ISL is very
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
clear they can only advocate for
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
municipal issues those are the god rails
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
so by clear inference to me is that the
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislature 65 years ago saw the value
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
of that dialogue and information sharing
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
so again I don't think this bill is
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
necessary and I would uh respectfully
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
request that you uh vote HB 456 as
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate have to answer
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
any questions are there any questions
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
any brief questions I have one brief
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
question um would it be your opinion
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
that um the majority of the 234 cities
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
and towns uh rely exclusively on uh nhma
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
or or some organization to provide them
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
um the information of What legislation
 
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
is uh coming that affects them I say in
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
in most part it uh most of of our
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
communities rely upon nhma for that
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
information we receive a legal bulletin
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
every Friday which is mailed to all
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
local officials which explains the bills
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
of Municipal interest the impacts of
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
those and the position that nhma has
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
been directed to take by its legislative
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
policy conference you know there's been
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
a previous question about how do you you
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
know if you have some communities that
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
are for or some against how do you
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
handle that a perfect example some of
 
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
you folks may remember education funding
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
the donor receiver communities I mean we
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
were split right down the middle as far
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
as some communities would benefit and it
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
would cost other communities on under
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
that legislation everybody knew our
 
01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
members knew and understood that nhma
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
could not take a position on that
 
01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
particular legislation because it would
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
impact our members in to various degrees
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
both in a positive way and a negative
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
way last question for me is is that
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
bulletin available to anyone or just to
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
it thank you any further questions
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
coming here appreciate it uh I have no
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
more pink cards um I am closing the
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
hearing on um whatever the number is
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
1576 that's turot
 
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.510 align:start position:0%
1576 that's turot
that's

01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
two um okay so now we're done we're
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
moved out of the um out of the public
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
hearing um for that bill we are going to
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
then jump back into the executive
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
session mode um we are now down to three
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
314 I believe anyone want to disagree
 
01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.430 align:start position:0%
314 I believe anyone want to disagree
with

01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
that um Mr chair oh 314 we've already
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
done uh that was retained in a
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
prior in a prior session
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%

second seconded by uh representative
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.709 align:start position:0%
 
handout

01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
handout
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
way I got a one and that goes that
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
way um what you will be getting or have
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
in front of you um is a complaint
 
01:37:59.310 --> 01:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
process uh
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the truthfulness in
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um and this came out of the
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
speaker's office as you can see on the
 
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
first line um I'll just read the
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
last uh well I guess it's the last
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh the speaker's office will
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
review the complaint and correspond with
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
the complaintant if more complete
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
information is necessary the speaker
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
office will evaluate the unique facts
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
and circumstances around each complaint
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
determine whether the complaint is
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
actionable and develop a method to
 
01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
actionable and develop a method to
address

01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
it that would seem to uh take
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
steam out of um out of house bill
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
315 um but I just wanted it it seemed to
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
me that not many people were aware of
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
this process so I wanted to make sure
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
that was in front of it anyone um is
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%

01:38:58.159 --> 01:39:03.189 align:start position:0%

157 representative turot thank you Mr
chairman

01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to keep it very brief just a
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
few points on it and most of these
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
points I've already gone over with the
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor U prior um I I I think
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
the I think the concept of what they're
 
01:42:05.790 --> 01:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is actually good um I
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
think more detailed fiscal analysis also
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
would be uh very very commendable but uh
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's just unworkable for a lot of
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
reasons and I'll give you those reasons
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
first it's just the amount of time that
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be required to produce these uh
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
extremely detailed notes uh most likely
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
would also require additional Manpower
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
which would also incur um of course more
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
costs and it because of the time
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
required to do this it probably impact
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
is as you what we get now is and I'm
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
going to agree with the prime sponsor
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsors that what we get now is
 
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes questionable at best it's very
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
on a microscopic level m a microeconomic
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
level the problem is is when you
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
start expanding out from the micro to
 
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
the macro level you start introducing
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
subjectivity into the analysis and the
 
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
further you get and the more
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh macro you
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
get that analysis can go either way way
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
and I would even say that it could go
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
either way based on political leanings
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
so um the last the last part of the the
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
reason or the last thing that I would
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
say is I I believe again the concept is
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
good and as I told the prime sponsor
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of lot of good names on
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
here and instead of forming yet another
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
study committee why not get together
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the individuals on this
 
01:43:58.589 --> 01:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
list spend some time and see what you
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
can come up with uh something that is
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
better than establishing a study
 
01:44:06.189 --> 01:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
committee I I think it's I think it's
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a an exercise in futility
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
but at least give it a try for those
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
um interested in doing it I see a lot of
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
names from uh Ways and Means on here and
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
so I I think that would be the way to go
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
and for all those reasons I
 
01:44:26.589 --> 01:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
I stand by the U inexpedient to
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you representative
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
turkot um the bill is open for further
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um and I have in front of
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
me an
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment um from the prime sponsor at
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
at all um and it is
 
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.470 align:start position:0%
at all um and it is
20257

01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
20257
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
62h I'm hoping everyone has a copy of
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
that um and I would recognize um
 
01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative payer for uh summarizing
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps yes thank you thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
um so representative muns who's in the
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
room brought the amendment forward to
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
make it easier um and Consolidated the
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
members to make it more
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
concise um and also kind of limited the
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
duties so that it addressed the concerns
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
that were brought up in committee um
 
01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
when we first discussed this bill so
 
01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes it more um
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
streamlined and less cumbersome to
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
address some of those
 
01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't uh
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
disagree with the amendment
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
um however it doesn't change my opinion
 
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
of the itl motion and and for this
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
reason I'm not sure you could
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
amend my biggest concern which is given
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
our time constraints we have a twoyear
 
01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.390 align:start position:0%
our time constraints we have a twoyear
twoyear

01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
twoyear
 
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
term um and we have numerous deadlines
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
I've this this is not the first time
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
this conversation has been had um just
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
so everyone knows and I'm sure
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative wall can back me up on
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
that the fact that we could have um a
 
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
deeper dive uh for lack of a better term
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
but um but it's awfully hard to do I
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
think he our our secretary uh no our
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
house clerk mentioned one that uh was
 
01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
recently done in Commerce as I recall um
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
that was an eight-month process trying
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
to fit eight months into our two-year
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislative term inter
 
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh posing all of our deadlines in the
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
same time makes
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
it damn near impossible so I'm I'd be
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy listening to suggestions
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
of how that can be done within our time
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
frame I think um in conversations I've
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
had recently with um prior members prior
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
directors of os um and
 
01:47:11.199 --> 01:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
directors of os um and
LBA

01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
LBA
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
um they would be willing to discuss
 
01:47:18.669 --> 01:47:18.679 align:start position:0%
possibilities of how to do this
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not for you know a thousand
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
bills but but perhaps for the two or
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
three or four that we're that we're um
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
generally thinking of um but um but even
 
01:47:31.159 --> 01:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
generally thinking of um but um but even
if

01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
we were to retain this and talk about it
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
within committee it's not going to come
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
out until next uh January and and then
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're and by the time it then passes
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
the Senate um and is signed by the
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
governor presumably we're giving a very
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
small little window for that type of De
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
deep dive discussion um as a as a
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee as a study
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
committee my better suggestion I think I
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
follow along with representative turot
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
that um I'm a much bigger fan of ad hoc
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
committees um you know what you want to
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
talk about you know the people you want
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
to have in that study committee do it
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
now um why wait for that whole big
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
scenario to keep going by and come back
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
with a bill rather than a study
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
there's we had a we had a meeting for
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
those that are freshmen we had a meeting
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
last year on committees and commissions
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
in that committee and I I'm pleased to
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
be able to quote Mar uh representative
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
Smith margorie
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
Smith we have smart people here um we
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
don't need commissions we have all with
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
425 of us we have enough uh um brain
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
power here to solve almost anything and
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be done within the
 
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
framework of a study committee um I
 
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
think it can be
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
done I think it could be discussed on an
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
ad hoc basis now not waste the time and
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps even in September come
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
back with a better Bill thank you
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative way thank you um so this
 
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
is more of a general question it sounds
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
like there's a separate issue of the
 
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
deadlines um being really tight that
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
would make this infeasible so so is
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
there um or has there been any kind of
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
review of those deadlines uh in the
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
house you just expanded this bill um
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
beyond all all um now now we're talking
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
a constitutional Bill okay I didn't know
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
if that was something that was already
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
under review or if that's something that
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
would yeah be beneficial it was in 1784
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know um there's uh there's a lot of
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
things that we do that are
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
um based on the second Tuesday of the
 
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
third Wednesday beginning with T You
 
01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
Know It uh it would be a much bigger
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
discussion uh it's really not
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the exact session unless
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's a question that somebody had but
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you um I think uh I see no
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
further questions I'm happy to uh ask
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the rooll on U on the
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry that's okay thank you for
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
the time were you waving long or is that
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
did I just not see you no I wasn't
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
waving too long I you just did that a
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
little fast and so I and then I started
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
to wave at you that's okay I'm all good
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
no no no problem it's not it doesn't
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
count as the mistake you're still it too
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
um uh so um I
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
um have felt
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
inspired um in some of the testimony
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
from the previous Bill to just State and
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start to try to do this
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
because this is from um the beginning of
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
our bill to just State um for every bill
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
would you believe the question I have is
 
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
that the online support for this bill
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
was 116 and opposition was
 
01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
seven that's all thank you
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
I I will agree that I am remiss to uh
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
State those I do look at each and every
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
one of them um and I have the numbers
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere here um but I am remissed to
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
put it on the public record um with that
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
any further com question of the chair uh
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
we are going to vote on an itl for 157
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming we're not voting on the
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
amendment since it never received a
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
second also um
 
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
we could um if anyone would like
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
to we did not we introduced it we did
 
01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:02.310 align:start position:0%
to we did not we introduced it we did
not

01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
um can I make a
 
01:52:08.109 --> 01:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
motion we can oh I'm getting the
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
on that's right there is
 
01:52:19.709 --> 01:52:19.719 align:start position:0%
no it this would have the LL would have
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
to be voted down in order toak bring up
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment you can't have before the
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
amendment got the chance to be
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
introduced what's that that motion was
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
made before the amendment got the chance
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
to be introduced
 
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
correct motion was made the motion was
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
made itl and then we we brought up the
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
discussion of this you would have to
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
vote down the
 
01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:49.639 align:start position:0%
itl and then um offer a motion of ought
 
01:52:52.069 --> 01:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
to pass and then introduce the amendment
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
and ask for a second that would be the
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
procedure question on procedure question
 
01:53:01.629 --> 01:53:01.639 align:start position:0%
so how we have the procedure uh person
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
here so yeah so I guess I was expecting
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we would have discussed the
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
amendment first like we did previously
 
01:53:11.229 --> 01:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
for from a procedural point of view but
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
that was well no procedurally prior to
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
this we had an oop pass motion and then
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
and then we moved um it was open to
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
further Amendment and we brought in the
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
amendment you can have octop pass as
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
amended you can't have itl as amended
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
right point of parliamentary inquiry oh
 
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh Mr chair why do we have a copy
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
of the amendment before us if it was
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
there no intention to introduce it um it
 
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
was a discussion Point um it was brought
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
up I think actually in the original
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
discussion of the yeah you can point to
 
01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:57.639 align:start position:0%
it all you want but I'm telling you that
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
it was brought up during the discussion
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the um original motion that um that
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
they had had a conversation and there
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
was an amendment so we were talking
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
about what was in that Amendment so yep
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair so I I
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're we're we're
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
getting this thorough because it's my
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that amendments could be
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
brought to a a committee to Executive
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
session that that simply don't get
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
picked up or or moved right it's
 
01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not unprecedented that an
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
amendment would be on the table but
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
never never acted upon is that correct
 
01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
um I think probably more than half of my
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
amendments that I brought to Executive
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
session were never um introduced it's a
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
discussion Point more than anything
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
chair good you had your hand raised
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
Representative turot no you've taken it
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative Vil said exactly what I
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
was going to say he often does that um
 
01:54:57.870 --> 01:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative way thank you Mr
 
01:55:00.030 --> 01:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize this amendment was was put
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
forward and we had intended to vote on
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
it and discuss it but the motion to to
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
itl it was the very first thing that was
 
01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
said on this bill there wasn't even any
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
period of time for us to make a motion
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
to introduce the amendment and second
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
it I I understand that maybe at this
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
point we can't since the itl motion has
 
01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
already been made but I just want to
 
01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that future amendments get the
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity be to be introduced before
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
we immediately jump to the itl
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
motion um representative Ville thank you
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um it it's my understanding
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
that if an itl motion is is made then
 
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
the way to get the uh Amendment brought
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
up is to overturn the the itl in
 
01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
committee and so then because we we only
 
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
um operate by affirmative disposition
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
right so if you if the if the itl is
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
rejected then presumably the next motion
 
01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass and at that point
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment could be brought forward
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
for consideration is that correct Mr
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
chair I concur with representative
 
01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
sirart once again you said what I should
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
have said in so I'm still representative
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
veral I think think we switched
 
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
it representative turot agreeing with
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:56:24.669 --> 01:56:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
further represent Barton yes uh so if an
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
amendment was made that would have
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
improved the original bill and I never
 
01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
had a chance to see it or hear it or
 
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
even entertain it um before the motion
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
was made because someone quickly jumped
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
to an itl motion which I seconded but I
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have seen this if I would
 
01:56:49.069 --> 01:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
have seen this maybe I would have
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
changed my mind and said no this with
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
this incorporated into into the bill it
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass it doesn't make
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
sense uh to me to have an amendment
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
presented before the committee and and
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
not be considered because now all I
 
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
consider I can't even consider this I
 
01:57:08.589 --> 01:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
can only consider the the legislation
 
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's be been moved before me and if I
 
01:57:14.669 --> 01:57:14.679 align:start position:0%
vote itl on that and and this would have
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
changed my opinion if it was introduced
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
that opportunity is is gone so I don't
 
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
understand the procedure so um I
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
disagree with your your premise um you
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
do have the opportunity I um I allowed
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
um or first off the amendment was
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
emailed to the entire committee week ago
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
anyway something like that um
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
secondly um you still have the
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to consider that um you
 
01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
would just vote no on the I motion and
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
then the committee would be able to do
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
it you have it in front of you um it's
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
not that you can't consider it you can
 
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
motion representative W thank you Mr
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman I wonder if the members who
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
made the itl motion will be willing
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
to withdraw that for now so we could
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
that seeing no further
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
discussion I can ask the clerk to call
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
the role uh on the motion of itl on
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%

point of order I don't know yes um is a
 
01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
I thought a tie vote out of committee
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
was a no recommendation and so got to go
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
through the process fair enough thank
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%

confusion here is like parliamentary
 
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
procedure so thank you maybe yeah the

um again fiscal notes are consistently a
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
troubling thing and we do have a lot of
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
study commissions um we've actually just
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%

02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
there's good representation here on this
 
02:01:49.390 --> 02:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
process because fiscal notes do cause a
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
problem and a burden and sometimes I
 
02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
always want wonder why some of these
 
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
bills even have a fiscal note um so
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
putting together a study committee and I
 
02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment minimizes the impact of
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
that and simplifies it with regards to
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
the scope and the membership so if we
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
had folks that there's clearly
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
individuals that want to participate in
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
this study committee so I think that
 
02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
that speaks to a lot there was a lot of
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
support online so why not put it through
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
our committee and let the house floor
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
decide on um moving
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
forward that's my thoughts
 
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
discuss um I just want to emphasize I
 
02:02:33.870 --> 02:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
support this amendment because I think
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
it incorporates a lot of the feedback
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we got during that initial hearing
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
um including things like incorporating
 
02:02:42.069 --> 02:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant as a
 
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
member which I think might be more
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
challenging to do as an ad hoc committee
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I fully agree there are lots of
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
committees that might be obsolete at
 
02:02:53.790 --> 02:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
this point or might not meet or have a
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
very narrow scope that might have been
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
better served by an ad hoc committee but
 
02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:00.679 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a case where it's a
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
persistent issue that comes back year
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
after year and I think this amendment
 
02:03:08.189 --> 02:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
does a good job at keeping the scope
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable and approaching this in a way
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
involved further discussion
 
02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.270 align:start position:0%
involved further discussion
representative

02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
the really the changing of the
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
membership and uh
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
removing being appointed by
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
chairpersons um this changes none of my
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
perspective on the underlying bill and
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
I'll reiterate for the record those
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
issues um one I believe the sponsors and
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors can do this uh ad hoc
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
without a
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
formal um committee yet another study
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee being uh formed um we talked
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
about the time requirement the disc uh
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
detailed fiscal notes um the uncertainty
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
and subjectiveness of the expansion U
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
when you start expanding the scope of
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
these fiscal notes and uh again I will
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
say that I think the concept is good I I
 
02:04:24.189 --> 02:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be very helpful to
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
have better fiscal
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
analysis I would suggest the individuals
 
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors and co-sponsors get together
 
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
and come up with the plan and a bill for
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
representative um wall thank you very
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
much um since there seems to be such
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
concern on both sides on this and
 
02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
initially had had bipartisan sponsorship
 
02:04:55.069 --> 02:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
now and this amendment also has
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh sponsorship and support
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to retain this and
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
work on it uh you're you're
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
floor um further
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
discussion see representative
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary um question so if if this
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
is a split decision then would it be
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
open for a motion of retain afterwards
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
it would it would indeed thank you Mr
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
