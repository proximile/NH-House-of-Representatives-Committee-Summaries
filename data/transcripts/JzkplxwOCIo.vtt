testimony
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
and and they've dug in a little bit into
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
the issues at play but there are
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
pressures that are preventing them from
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
digging too
 
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.830 align:start position:0%
digging too
deeply

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
deeply
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
and if those house creates a committee
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
those pressures go
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
away if you read my email you know that

authorized to answer those
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
questions this is not McCarthy we have
 
00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:20.549 align:start position:0%
questions this is not McCarthy we have
specific

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
names of people
 
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
within these branches of government and
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
agencies that that have been the subject
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
of repeated
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
complaints and over the years the
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
victims come to the Committees and say
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have a problem and the committee say
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
that is terrible thank you for letting
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
us know we'll try to write a
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
bill and hope that we can change it for
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
the next people who go through the
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
system I think we've lost a little bit
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
of understanding that our main job our
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
first job is to redress grievance when
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
the rights of the people
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
are being
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
trespassed we swore oath to that that we
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
will do that and from time to time pass
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
bills as may be necessary for the common
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
good so the committee will work to
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
thoroughly investigate allegations of
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
misconduct conflicts of interest
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
maladministration violations of due
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
process that we know from testimony in
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
those other committees already exist
 
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
violations of court orders perjury and
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
coverup that have been heard in
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee hearings in this body for 20
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
years or
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
more why is it
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
needed sununu Youth Detention Center
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory need I say more on that
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
well I will will it bankrupt the state
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
when the lawsuit damn breaks are the
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
problematic players still seated in
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
office or
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
employment $38
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
million awarded to one victim despite
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
this body trying to prevent payouts more
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
than 475,000
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
we cannot legislate the state out of
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
liability for this we can prevent
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
further abuses from like this from
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
happening if we take Swift decisive
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
action not only with legislation but we
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
need to investigate and hold accountable
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
when we find that those inves tigations
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
lead to certain
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
people over and over again or certain
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
processes over and over again we've
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
already have around 240 cases for the
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
sununu center YDC case um as of May with
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
1400 victims in total so do the
 
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.269 align:start position:0%
1400 victims in total so do the
math

00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
math
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
um there are allegations of conflicts of
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
interest in handling investigations
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
between the state and private
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
contractors and just looking at who
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
those players are it's obvious that does
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
need to be looked into you've got the AG
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
you've got law firms and the Coalition
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
against Domestic and Sexual Violence
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
playing both sides at different points
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
over the years one on the side of the
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
victims other times on the side of the
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
state it's a little convoluted and it
 
00:26:21.399 --> 00:26:23.310 align:start position:0%
state it's a little convoluted and it
needs

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
probing without the house having the
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
ability to effectuate our power we're
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
probably never going to get a real
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
investigation on that as of May 16th the
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
state has awarded $66 million through
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
the settlement fund and those
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
represented by other claimants are
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
getting higher s
 
00:26:44.919 --> 00:26:47.389 align:start position:0%
getting higher s
settlements

00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
settlements
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
um do you want to keep up racking up
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
more of those
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
cases how big is our state
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
budget we're talking billions
 
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.470 align:start position:0%
budget we're talking billions
potentially

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
why is this committee needed the people
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
have brought testimony repeatedly
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
alleging the following issues in family
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
court that a Judicial retreat in the
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
1990s resulted in a group of Judges
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
planning to run Family Court as a
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
business that judges in there are not
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
judges but Federal contractors they're
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
called surrogate judges their orders are
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations and not enforcable
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
unless signed by a judge who and they
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
have testified judges actual judges have
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
sign testified before the house that
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
they can't sign off on orders over wi
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
cases which they didn't preside so are
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
the orders from Family Court even
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
enforceable Family Court fails to
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
protect children again these are
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
allegations there have been deaths of
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
children and kidnappings directly
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
related to the failures of Family
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
Court it depends on which court and
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
which judge you have whether you get
 
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.230 align:start position:0%
which judge you have whether you get
Fair

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
Fair
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
process decision-making is arbitrary
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
some courts make findings of abuse in
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
100% of cases such as Keen in 2023 and
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
others make findings of abuse in 0% of
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
cases such as brentw Brentwood and marac
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
in 2023 that is worth a closer look the
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
findings of abuse that occur in Family
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
Court follow uh that the F that occur in
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
Family Court follow statute that
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
sidesteps constitutional due process
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
part one Article 15 requires a trial by
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
jury before your Liberty interests are
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
taken from you your children are the
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
oldest Liberty interests and your dear
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
having your children taken from you is
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
akin to Capital
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
Punishment yet there is no trial by jury
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
option you can appeal to the superior
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
court but anything that's ruled judicial
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
discretion is not sub
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
admissible and most things are ruled
 
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
admissible and most things are ruled
judicial

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
discretion there are failures of the
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
court to make appropriate referrals and
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
address crime and criminal activity is
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
child abuse a crime
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
why are there no criminal
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
charges by failing to make
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
referrals um they're perpetuating
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
criminal activity and
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
abuse a 1990 uh sorry family court is
 
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
operated by private
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
contractors they all know each other
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
I've heard the phrase Court Country Club
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
once private contractors that work in
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
the Family Court are not limited or
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
accountable for unregulated billing
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're granted full immunity for the
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
work they
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
do they work collaboratively with each
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
other sometimes not in the best
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
interests of the litigants or the
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
children contributing to bias in the
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
court rules of evidence are not strictly
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
adhered to and can be applied
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily and how they're applied can
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
determine the outcome of a case in some
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
cases they'll accept evidence from one
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
party and none from the
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
other transcripts often have
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies and alter options from what
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
actually was said in court failure of
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
the court to comply with Federal
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirements to hold child support
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
orders causing homelessness for litigant
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
through orders separating families
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
without evidence failure to to disclose
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%

00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
cases that should be easily dealt with
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
and in and out of the Court quickly that
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
aren't high conflict are kept in a state
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
20% and this is
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
not these are specific allegations about
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
specific courts and specific people
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
specific contractors that I'm speaking
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
about in generalities this is not to say
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
that the entirety of the court system is
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
corrupt and and you know that every
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
single person is guilty these are these
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
are complaints that need to be looked
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
into this again this is not McCarthy
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
these are specific instances that have
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
been brought to the attention of this
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
body and to the court and to the AG in
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
many C in many instances that just went
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere and the people are looking for
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
redress they're coming to the people's
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
Branch for it
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
DCF 117 child deaths directly linked to
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
DC CF since
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
2018 I'll say that again the office of
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
the child advocate came into existence
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and yes since it was formed it
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
has found 117 children have died who had
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
DCF involved in their
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
children there are allegations that some
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
agents have covered up their mistakes
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
and in order to do so they left children
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
to be further abused and in order to
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
protect themselves failure on the part
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
themselves in court motions without
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
consequence dcyf employees telling the
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
family court that a child should be
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
reunified with a stepfather who is being
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
investigated for sexual abuse of three
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%

conditions not to be around the children
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
and protective orders and dcyf went and
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
told the family court that that home is
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
safe and the children would benefit from
 
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.389 align:start position:0%
safe and the children would benefit from
being

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
there the state refuses to settle on
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
cases where the petitioner seeks
 
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.350 align:start position:0%
cases where the petitioner seeks

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
termination there is one specific worker
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
at DCF who is named in many of the
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and is still working and is
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
still on the
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
cases that the lawsuits are
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
about there are DCF DCF workers alleged
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
um that a father sexually abused his
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
children when those same workers knew
 
00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
the daycare that the children attended

crimes and did not disclose that
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
DCF has been alleged of hiding
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence and refusing to
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
hand it over to the family court Court
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
they've made findings of abuse in closed
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
hearings without the option for the
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
accused to appear face their accuser
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
offer evidence of their innocence or
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
view evidence against them those
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
findings put their name on a nationwide
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
registry limiting their career and
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
custody opportunities and often are
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
rubber stamps stamped by the family
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
court as
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
true allegations that depr that DCF
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
regularly deprives substantive due
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
process and procedural due process
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
process they failed to provide
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
court-ordered physician recommended
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%

children in their
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
care there are allegations of problems
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
with the District Attorney's offices in
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with these complaints about DCF
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
and the family court as
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
well there's allegations of
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
collaboration between DCF and police in
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
pursuing charges against parents say
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
retaliation for disagreement with dcyf
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
these are serious allegations I hope
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
they're not true I we need to stay
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
skeptical we need to approach this with
 
00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:07.870 align:start position:0%
skeptical we need to approach this with
a

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
balanced um you know standpoint of
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
examination but these things do need to
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
be examined they are worth pursuing and
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
having a true investigation about I just
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
spoke with a mom in the hallway who I've
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
never met before who told me yet another
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
horror story about her kids and she's
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
sitting in the
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
gallery she hasn't seen her son in over
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
400 Days he was taken from her in an exp
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
parte she claims her husband was abusing
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
her and there was a finding of abuse by
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
DCF that the the family court ignored
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
and in an Exar motion overturned that
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
allegation and granted custody to him
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
and said that she was manipulating the
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
child and there may be truth to
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
that but they're coming to us for a
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
reason because they're not getting
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
further redress
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so this is our job we're the
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
people's Branch we have the power of
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
Investigation we don't utilize it often
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
we we seem to have a an idea that you
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
know everyone who works in our state
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
government has good intentions but we
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
need to bear in mind that people with
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
ulterior motives and predatory behavior
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
seek out positions where they have
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
access to people they wish to exploit
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
and predate
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
predate so we can't protect
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
them just in order to protect the good
 
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.910 align:start position:0%
them just in order to protect the good
workers

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
too we need to look into these
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
seriously how are we going to chase down
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
all these rabbit Trails one at a time we
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
look into the complaint collect the
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
testimony subpoena Witnesses documents
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
if necessary what do you have have to
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
say about these allegations against you
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
or your department or your your employee
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
did you know about this find the
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
history if we find common threads pursue
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
it we're looking at policy of course but
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
there are more than policy issues here
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the other two committees don't have
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
the tools at their disposal because of
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
house rules and improper influence RSA
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
6:30 640 col
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
3 this motion allows the body to move
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
around the improper influence and give
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
the committee all the tools it needs to

house will be in order the motion before
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
us is to suspend the
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
rules this is a roll call vote chair
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this has never
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
been done in the history of the house
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
and that even if I were inclined to
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
support it it would be better to ask me
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
that question on day one of a session so
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
it could be monitored evaluated and
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
adjusted as it needed and not as we're
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
literally headed out the door and Mr
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I also know that it's
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because if there are indeed
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
specific allegations against specific
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
people State officials any member is
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
free to file a house resolution for
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
articles of impeachment and that no one
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
has done that then Mr Speaker would I
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
defeat this unnecessary and potentially
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mi Mr Speaker if if
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
I know that there's a very small nominal
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
cost to to print remarks in the
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
permanent journal and Mr Speaker if I
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
know we routinely print uh remarks of

all different Natures into the permanent
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%

this topic addresses a very serious
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%

now but has been for
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
decades and Mr Speaker if I believe that
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's some value in allowing those
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
insufficient moreover this access by an
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
independent party presents not only
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
concerns with parental consent and the
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
release of personally identifiable
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
information but also risks the reporting
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
of inaccurate
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
conclusions in fact the role of the
 
00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:58.309 align:start position:0%
conclusions in fact the role of the
independent

00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
State special education Advocate was
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
never specifically addressed in the
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
audit in summary let's not push put the
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
partially assembled cart before the
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
horse we should wait for the Department
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
of Education to work on the required
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
improvements in data collection first to
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
assemble a reliable and complete
 
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
database then when the final audit of
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
the department is complete we can use
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
the suggested recommendations for future
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive legislative action I urge
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
you to vote against the adoption of the
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
committee of conference report and press
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
the red button and Mr Speaker I request
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
a division
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
lad good morning and thank you than you
 
00:50:56.799 --> 00:50:57.710 align:start position:0%
lad good morning and thank you than you
Mr

00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'd like to not address that
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
simple part in the the amend uh the
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
original Bill itself was very simple but
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
I want to address the amendment which uh
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
came forward and why it came forward we
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
received just recently the LBA
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
performance audit regarding due process
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
and this is dealing with when a parent
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
refuses or partially refuses to accept
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
services or placement of a student with
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
a dis ability proposed or identified in
 
00:51:28.839 --> 00:51:29.829 align:start position:0%
a dis ability proposed or identified in
an

00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
IEP I don't know if anybody's been
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
through that process I
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
have and it's a very difficult process
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
the first thing you want to do of course
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
if you're not satisfied for what your
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
youngster is receiving you go meet with
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
the teacher the special education
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
teacher No Satisfaction go to the
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
principal No Satisfaction there you can
 
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
go and appeal to the Department of
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
Education and request a formal hearing
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
but this process is extremely
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
expensive and this is why back in
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
2022 we introduced legislation that
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
passed the house passed the Senate was
 
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
signed in law creating the independent
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
Office of the special education Advocate
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
to assist those parents which have
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that the IP is not being
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
followed or whatever issue the parent
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
may have my concern was service weren't
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
being delivered in speech therapy to my
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
grandson I asked to see the log of the
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
times the individuals the service
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
providers had met with my
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
grandson speech par Pathologists had not
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
in fact they had a par delivering that
 
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.069 align:start position:0%
in fact they had a par delivering that
service

00:52:47.069 --> 00:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
occasionally so I was concerned but at
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
the time I chaired the select board in
 
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
the community I was on the zoning board
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
planning board and in this House
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
Representatives it would have been
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
deadly for me to cause this Ruckus
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
because this went a lot
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
farther than just Rick lad and my wife
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
and my
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
grandson so now that
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
grandson is doing quite well and I was
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
opted to have my daughter who is a
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist deliver the services
 
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.349 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist deliver the services
at

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
home and he's very successful right now
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
majoring in finance as a senior doing a
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
internship down CNS in Keane but if this
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the hearing process and it
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't even get settled there it can go
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
system and we had testimony from parents
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
and attorneys that is an extremely
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
expensive process and most of the cases
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
are dropped because the parent doesn't
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
have the wherewithal to pay for these
 
00:53:54.599 --> 00:53:57.309 align:start position:0%
have the wherewithal to pay for these
services

00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
so when we have an issue dealing with
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
the IEP or a 504 plan and it's
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
referencing to the services provided
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
this bill provides a way for that to be
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
corrected the performance audit listed
 
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.829 align:start position:0%
corrected the performance audit listed
20

00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
observations six observations they say
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
may require legislative
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
action we decided we can take action we
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
just can't wait and kick this can down
 
00:54:26.599 --> 00:54:27.430 align:start position:0%
just can't wait and kick this can down
the

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
road talked with I sat in meeting after
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
meeting with the special education
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
Advocate the Department of Education and
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys representing both sides they
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
came to mutual agreement on this
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
bill they agreed we need to take action
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
now and so we have brought forward a
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill here that deals with requirement
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
for reporting from the local districts
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
to the department every September 1 but
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
most importantly in this Bill we found
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
out during these discussions that the
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
records of these students which have
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
IEPs for example that grandson I had
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
who's now a senior at St Lawrence
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
University his records are still in that
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
database that the department has the
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
database is
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
Antiquated and so they're saying wow we
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
can't let the advocate into this
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
database because we can't be searching
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
one record you're going to see all 100
 
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
to 200,000 records that in that
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
database we can't do that because those
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
people are now mostly adults and furpa
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
and all that they haven't given
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
permission for this information to be
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
released so what this bill did it
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
created anou that's going to be
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
developed between the advocate's office
 
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.349 align:start position:0%
developed between the advocate's office
and

00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
doe that will be created allowing The
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
Advocate to have anou to access that
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
record but thee will access all that
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
information and provide it to The
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
Advocate K office so help can be
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
provided to these families which are not
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
sure they and actually they know the
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
services like mine weren't being
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
delivered so I encourage you all to
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
concur on this bill we need it we can't
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
wait and kick this can down the road we
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
have people out there needing this
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
service thank
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
you B has requested a division this will
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
the motion before us to adopt the
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee report on Senate Bill 340 this
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
is a division vote chair recognized
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner for a
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
phase one of the lb's performance audit
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
of special education dispute resolution
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
process was just released this March and
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
if I know this early phase of the audit
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
identifies many issues within the
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
special education department that need
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
to be addressed but most importantly
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's the correction of deficiencies with

whoops sorry
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
MCE speech just slipped off here okay
 
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
currently landowners are get a 20%
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
discount on their property taxes if they
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
don't post the no trespassing sign and
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
keep it open for recreation without
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
charging a fee so if you put up a no
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
trespassing sign you don't get the 20%
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
discount um now what this bill would do
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be to post signs that say no
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
trespassing except for skiing
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing fishing hunting hiking or
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
nature observation and they'd be able to
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
keep the 20% discount the specific
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
Target of the law are people who are
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
crossing over the EXT extremely
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
extremely rural 58 mile border that New
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shares with
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
Canada this bill is being promoted as a
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
Border Protection me measure but what it
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
is is a plan designed to put limited
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
rural I'm sorry limited rural law
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement resources into a securing a
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
border that sees fewer incidents in a
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
hour now the problem with this bill is
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
how do you differentiate between a
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
person who is who is hiking through
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's property to enjoy the great
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
outoors and hiking and doing those
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
activities or to versus somebody who may
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
have entered the country illegally and I
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
say that you can't um and I don't know
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
about you I don't I don't carry a
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
license I don't carry my passport when
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
I'm hiking
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
so if we passed this bill we'd have
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
limited state and local law enforcement
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
wandering through the woods asking
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
people to show their papers or show a
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
resque how many of you would bring your
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
hike so the bottom line the bottom line
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
is that this is a bill that that is
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
really unnecessary it's going to T tax
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
our local law enforcement and it's a a
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
bill in search of it's legislation in
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
search of a problem so I would urge you
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
to vote no with the committee of
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
hun okay Mr
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh this amendment is sort of a
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
red herring into this
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
bill this is is already law it's already
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
statute it is not about where you hike
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's over the entire
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
State anybody who has land in current
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
use is getting already a tax cut there
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
is a special tax cut an extra
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
20% if on your
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
sign your posted sign you say hiking is
 
01:13:54.199 --> 01:13:56.910 align:start position:0%
sign your posted sign you say hiking is
permitted

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
you get an extra
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
20% what's the harm in
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
that how this thing turned into that
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
police are going to be storming people's
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
land and looking for driver's license is
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
it's total red herring has nothing to do
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill nobody is ever you know
 
01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
questioned about why they're on
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's land hiking when it says the
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
land is posted for
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
hiking we need the liquor
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill this on premise on license on
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
premise license bill is a very important
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%

a problem and if I know that this bill
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
would put a a burden on limited law

inquiry this bill has nothing Mr Speaker
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
immigration this is an underlying liquor
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
bill that's very important housekeeping
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
measure and all I can say Mr Speaker is
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's already current law there's nothing
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
was would you believe that I don't know
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
where I am okay would you believe Mr
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker the legislation that is added is
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
added to the current use
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
law the reason being Mr Mr Speaker my
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it wanted to make
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
it clear that when people posted their
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
signs and said hiking was permitted that
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
they would not lose their tax credit Mr
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%

Maguire thank you Mr Speaker this bill
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
is 17 pages long and it's a
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh editing of our campaign
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
Finance uh laws most of it is is
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
perfectly benign and but I don't think
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
any of it is super
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
urgent but it does have serious uh
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
negative consequences for small dollar
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
donations what our current law says is
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
that when someone makes a donation to a
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
political Town committee or political
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
organization under
 
01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
$50 it doesn't have to be
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
reported um individually you don't
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
report the person name you don't report
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
their address and so on you just report
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
you know you had an event maybe and you
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
raised uh $150 in small
 
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
donations um similarly what a current
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
law says is that when you do report name
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
so if it's over a donation is over
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
$50 you report the person's name and
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
address and if their total donation to
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
this organization over the period of
 
01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:25.350 align:start position:0%
this organization over the period of
time

01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
is over $200 then you also report their
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
occupation their employer and their
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
employer's address that's current
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
law what this bill
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
does is it wants to have reporting when
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
the aggregate donation of someone to
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
this organization becomes over
 
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
$50 so what it says is for every
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
donation regardless of sign SI that
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
person's donation name and address will
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
reported and then the and and the bill
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
also has people do all their reporting
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
online and so when the Secretary of
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
State's online system finds out that
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
this person's donation total becomes
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
over $50 then the Secretary of State's
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
online system will disclose that
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
person's name name and address the
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
problem with this is small town
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
committees who have simple events right
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
you you have a house party with a
 
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
donation bowl or you pass the hat or or
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
you have a 5050 or you have a raffle of
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
some kind all those small dollar
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
donations now will have to be
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
accompanied with a clipboard where
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
everybody who puts in $5 or puts
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
$10 is going to have to put in their
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
name and their full address and then the
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
treasurer of this organization is going
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
to have to go online and enter all of
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
this data um for every single donation
 
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
so this is a big burden on treasurers I
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've ever tried to you
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
know recruit people to be treasurers of
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
a town committee but it's not that easy
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
and this is just going to end up
 
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
discouraging people from particip
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
ipation in the political process and I
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary do we really
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
care when somebody puts in $10 this week
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
and two months from now they put it in
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
another 20 and so on I mean it's just
 
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
it's way too
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
burdensome and and not worth doing thank
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr
 
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
quy thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
this bill is substantially similar to
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
the bill that passed back in March in
 
01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.189 align:start position:0%
the bill that passed back in March in
this

01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
house I think the most substantive
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
change is that it made some adjustments

01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank thank you Mr
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this with uh House
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 1091 was worked on for two years
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
and pretty much just made this change in
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
the final uh uh bring uh final uh
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
CC if I know that the house
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
bill now puts restrictions on collecting
 
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
information name and address for all
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
donations if I know that the main reason
 
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
to collect it this information is to
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's no
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
undue um control of legislators and I
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
don't believe $50 would swing my vote at
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
all and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
that I have constituents all the time
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
that ask me what the limit is and where
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
they can't be traced uh that's when they
 
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
where they make their decision I think
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
this will affect all especially State
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
reps that are running and with the $50
 
01:28:58.109 --> 01:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
donations mean something I would vote
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
against I would vote red and vote
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
against the C uh report thank
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize representer quy for
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
ining thank you Mr
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill is
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to the bill that
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
we passed back in
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
March and if I know that
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh the bill itself significantly re
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
clarifies and
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
simplifies a campaign Finance system
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
processes that candidates need to comply
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
with and that the public needs to depend
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
on to gain information about the
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance status of
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
candidates and if I agree that it
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
strikes a good balance between
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
transparency of uh campaign Finance uh
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
activities and
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh with reducing and controlling the
 
01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
administrative burden for candidates and

01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
property representative Alexander moves
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the committee of
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%

01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker just two weeks ago we this body
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
voted against hp1 1215 which included
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'm going to speak in
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to again after its defeat
 
01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
last time it was sent to a committee of
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
conference where the house positioned
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
should have been argued for it was not
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
and now we have before you the exact
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
same bill that we've already voted down
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
briefly the amendment 1215 would allow
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
the board of Selectmen in Hampton to
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
discontinue a road in the beach area and
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
rent that road up to 99 years to a
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
private business this would bypass the
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
normal process contained in our rsas
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
where the town votes on whether to allow
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
such an action New Hampshire law is very
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
specific that town residents are the
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
local legislative body to who are who
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
are empowered to both discontinue roads
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
and lease the property now the last time
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
we heard this amendment before this body
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
the main excuse given was that it was
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
needed because the amendment was time
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
critical that argument was negated as it
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
was ACC accurately pointed out that it
 
01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
takes less than two months for the town
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
meeting process to play out and that the
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
town citizens could have already voted
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
on this in fact in early September
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
primaries will be held giving the town
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to call a special meeting
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
and vote on the issue with very minimal
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
costs now one of the latest excuses
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
being used is that the 99-year lease
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
requires an immediate irsa change that's
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
factually incorrect 100% false the
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
current rsas allow both the
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
discontinuance of roads and leases to be
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by the voters using the town
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
meeting process the rsas allow the
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
Selectmen to lease up to 5 years without
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
voter approve approval over 5 years it
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
requires a vote voter approval just in a
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
town meeting just like the
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
discontinuance of a
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
road next several times the uh the blur
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
in the calendar mentions that this is
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation let's be really
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
clear on this point the only thing
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
enabling about this amendment is it
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
enables the Selectmen to bypass the
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
voters of
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
Hampton the other excuse being put forth
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
is this a oneoff uh is that one-offs are
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
done all the time personally I've never
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
seen anything close to a one-off such as
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
the one before you and if we believe
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
which I do not that these one-offs
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
happen all the time then it's time to
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
end them when we change our or add rsas
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
they should apply to every municipality
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
not a single not Town not a single
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
project as this amendment attempts to do
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
just imagine if this RSA change would
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
have been proposed for all
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities on a permanent basis can
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
you even imagine the Uproar and
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
Universal outrage over this so in
 
01:37:58.510 --> 01:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion the chairman of Municipal and
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
County government of the other other
 
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
body is against this bill the chairman
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
and mun of Municipal and County
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
government in this body is against this
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
bill our opposition to the bill is not
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
about Hampton or the developers of the
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
project or the project itself it's about
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
property rights of the abutters the town
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
citizens voting rights being arreated we
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
believe in fewer regul ations that are
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
pro business but they must be
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
advantageous to every business the issue
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
is also about consistency versus
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
arbitrariness this body should never do
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
one-offs or place temporary special
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
exemptions into our rsas for the
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
potential benefit of a few individuals
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
while negating the rights of their
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
citizens and the issue is about this
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
body not setting a terrible precedent
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
that could affect many Property Owners
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
throughout our state in the future
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
and above all and this is very important
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
the vote you were about to make will
 
01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:00.679 align:start position:0%
show whether you support ethical
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislative policies and
 
01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
procedures or not I ask that you vote
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%

stavis thank you Mr
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker my colleague has
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
spoken against hb12 15's non- gerine
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I Rise to speak against
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill proposal that will
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
not achieve the goals set forth by its
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors according to those sponsors
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
this bill will create more housing in
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but rather than providing
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
substantive initiatives it only seeks to
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
change the existing and successful law
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
that exempts developers from code and
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
land use regulation changes while their
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
projects are moving
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
forward supporters of the bill argued in
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference that such code
 
01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:25.719 align:start position:0%
code and ordinance changes are
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
sidelining developers because they lose
 
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
time and money in the process and
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately find their projects are no
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
longer profitable but in fact current
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
law prevents that from happening RSA
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
67439 the law hb1 1215 seeks to amend
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
exempts developers from any such changes
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
for a full two years after planning
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
board approval if they achieve active
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
and substantial progress in that time
 
01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
frame they then have another 5 years to
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
reach substantial completion again
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
exempt from all code and ordinance
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
changes if that is the case and those of
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
us who sit on planning boards know that
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
it is the case then perhaps we should
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
examine why hb125 supporters claim this
 
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
radical change is so desperately needed
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
developers they say need twice as much
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
time as current law allows they need
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
five years to achieve active progress
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
and 10 years to achieve substantial
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
completion the majority of the municipal
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
and County government committee which
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
exists to understand and improve the
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
land use law hb125 seeks to change
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
agrees by a wide and bipartisan margin
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
that these propos proposed new time
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
frames are
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
excessive what's more they will result
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
in less not more housing for New
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents by robbing towns of
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
their ability to move on from projects
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
that are clearly not successful to
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
pursue better and more successful
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
proposals hb1 1215 also makes the Bold
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
assumption that all New Hampshire
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
developers need this very generous time
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
frame when the majority of our
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
communities have seen subdivisions
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
multif family buildings and other types
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
of homes take shape in less than five
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
years I urge my colleagues to think
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
about the circumstances that might cause
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
a developer to need a full decade of
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
exemptions in our experience in Lebanon
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
those circumstances have included
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
stopping projects to pursue more
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
lucrative ones elsewhere in the state or
 
01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.510 align:start position:0%
lucrative ones elsewhere in the state or
simple

01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
mismanagement there's a good reason why
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
67439 allows 2 and 5year exemption
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
phases they allow ample time for a
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
well-run project to shake take shape and
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
be completed while protecting towns and
 
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
cities from developers who delay to
 
01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
enhance their bottom lines or just can't
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
get the work
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
done hb1 1215 will not generate new
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire it will do just
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
just the opposite it will allow a full
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
decade to elapse between approval and
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
completion a decade in which this
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
legislature will have passed new
 
01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:35.719 align:start position:0%
building codes and towns will have
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
enacted new ordinances to improve
 
01:43:41.589 --> 01:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
building and Energy Efficiency none of
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
which will apply to housing projects
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
should this Committee of conference
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
report be
 
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
adopted this is a bill that will
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly be good for some developers
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
but bad for New Hampshire citizens who
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
desperately need places to
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
live it will result in less not more
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
housing and will impose a heavy-handed
 
01:44:05.950 --> 01:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide mandate that will leave towns

saddled with long-term unsuccessful
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
development projects taking up land and
 
01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
resources that really would produce more
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
housing in less time I urge you to vote
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
no on adopting the committee of
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
conference report recommendation for
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%

01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
support of the motion to adopt the
 
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
committee of conference report on House
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 1215
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
this bill has four sections I will speak
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
specifically to section
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
four section four provides the Hampton
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
Selectmen a short limited window of
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to act if they choose on the
 
01:45:13.229 --> 01:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
following first is to dis discontinue a
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
435 ft portion of D Street Which is less
 
01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
than a tenth mile long second is to
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
enter into a long longterm lease of the
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
discontinued portion of the road with
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
the abutter who owns all of the
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
properties on both sides of this short
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
section of roadway importantly the
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
abutter is in full agreement with the
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
discontinuation of the road now some
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
feel that this legislation is
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and say that a special town
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
meeting or an annual town meeting can
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
accomplish what is in section four of
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
while it is correct that a special or
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
annual town meeting can vote to
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
discontinue a road the issue is that the
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
law is not clear regarding long-term
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
leases of town
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
property it is clear that there are at
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
least two options under RSA
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
411a number one Selectmen are given the
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
blanket authority to enter into a lease
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
of town property for up to one year and
 
01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
number two select Selectmen may be
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
authorized to enter into a lease of up
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
to five years by a vote of the
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
legislative body at an annual or special
 
01:46:38.599 --> 01:46:39.629 align:start position:0%
legislative body at an annual or special
town

01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
meeting additionally many agree that a
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
lease agreement for a period of more
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
than a year requires a vote by the town
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
but what is not clear and is not
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
properly understood by many is that for
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
a lease agreement longer than 5 years
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
the legislative body is required to vote
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
every five years to reauthorize the
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen to continue the lease
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise the lease terminates I believe
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
that this is a true and accurate
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation based on the recent
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
application of this law
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
411a and my own own town of
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
Brookline to explain in 2019 voters in
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
Brookline passed a warrant article to
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
allow the Selectmen to lease Town land
 
01:47:38.109 --> 01:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
on a on a pond to multiple tenants for
 
01:47:38.119 --> 01:47:39.910 align:start position:0%
on a on a pond to multiple tenants for
13

01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
13
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
years since the 13year leases were
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
longer than 5 years 411a requires voter
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
approval every 5 years as a result at
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
our 2024 town meeting a warrant article
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
to allow the Selectmen to extend these
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
leases for an additional five years was
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
voted on and was passed by the
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
voters and in 2029 the Brookline voters
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
will be asked again to vote to allow the
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
Selectmen F to further extend these
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
leases for an additional three years to
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
get to the 13 years which brings me to
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
this very important final
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
point in light of differing legal
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
interpretations of
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
411a if a special town meeting in
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampton under sb2 voted to discontinu D
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
Street and also to approve a long-term
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
lease of D Street for longer than 5
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
years it is unclear that a long-term
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
lease would stand up up to Legal review
 
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
by any institution financing the project
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
or to any other legal challenges
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
moreover with the real possibility that
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
a long-term lease is interpreted to be
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
valid for only five years no bank will
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
finance a multi-million dollar project
 
01:49:18.189 --> 01:49:18.199 align:start position:0%
due to the risk that the lease might not
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
be renewed therefore it is clear that a
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
special or even annual town meeting
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
approach is legally risky at best to
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
conclude given the ambiguous language of
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
411a it is entirely appropriate for the
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
state legislature to address this issue
 
01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.229 align:start position:0%
state legislature to address this issue
through

01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
legislation section four of House Bill
 
01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
1215 provides a clear well-defined
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
process free of legal uncertainty to the
 
01:49:55.709 --> 01:49:55.719 align:start position:0%
time of Hampton through their Selectmen
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
to discontinue and then lease D Street
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
enabling an appropriate project design
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
proposal to then be finalized to go
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
before the Hampton planning and zoning
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
boards therefore I urge my fellow
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support the committee of
 
01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:16.830 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support the committee of
conference

01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
report for a house bill 1215 by voting
 
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you Mr Speaker honorable
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
members I rise in opposition to H Bill
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
1215 as was amended by the other body my
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
reasons are as follows we already killed
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
this Hampton Amendment two weeks
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
ago and when the PE and when when the
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill went to the committee of conference
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
nothing changed and our position which
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
is the people's position was completely
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
ignored even though the committee of
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
conference members were again given the
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
factual information about why the
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
amendment needed to be
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
rejected and that if the Hampton
 
01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment wasn't removed the bill needed
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
to die it doesn't matter it was
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
ignored it is beyond disrespectful and
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
frankly an absolute waste of everyone's
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
time in this body when a majority is
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
ignored because of a select few personal
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
agendas it is unconscionable that there
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
are several representatives in this room
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
that have been silenced and or are
 
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
afraid of speaking out on this
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
borderline fraudulent Amendment which
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
circumvents the rights of Hampton voters
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
in fear of Retribution from legislative
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
power Brokers of losing their reelection
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
from party influence it is even worse
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
that filling the pockets of preferred
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
political candidates in Senate and House
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
packs must might have influenced pushing
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
through this amendment today we stand at
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
a critical juncture in our
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic our political
 
01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
system designed to represent the will of
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
the people the member will suspend it's
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%

here member has a right to be heard
 
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
member may continue thank you our
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
political system designed to represent
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
the will of the people is under constant
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
threat from conquered parking garages to
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
no bid contract property giveaways to to
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
Buddies to Laconia land grabs and more
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
we have some real ethical and integrity
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
problems under this gold Dome and many
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
have decided not to run again because of
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
it the Insidious influence of money and
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
politics has corroded the very
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
foundations of our constitutional
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
republic turning what should be a
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
government of by and for the people into
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
a government of by and for the highest
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
bitter that is not this is not about
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
whether this project is a good idea or
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
not I grew up going to the hamping
 
01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
casino ballroom since I actually was in
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
high school and it would be wonderful to
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
have a new venue because the property
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
has become pretty rundown this is only
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
about the process and the passing
 
01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
something that cuts out
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
16.5 th000 Plus Hampton residents who do
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
not who are the ones that actually have
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
the skin in the game here they are the
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and they need to make the
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
decision if they want this it is not our
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
place to circum invent their voice in
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
their vote the member will
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
suspend we're not to ascribe
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
motive this is wrong every time
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere we we look to see politicians
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
beholden the special interests
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
legislation crafted not for the common
 
01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
good for the benefit of wealthy donors
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
in a system that disproportionately
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
favors the voices of the Rich and
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
Powerful over those of ordinary citizens
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
this culture has eroded public trust in
 
01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
our institutions and undermined the Very
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
princip principles upon which we were
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
founded I was taught if you see
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
something you need to say something so I
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
will never stand stay silent and allow
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
this to continue while I am a member of
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
the body I try very hard to be a
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative for the people we cannot
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
sit oddly by as the voices of people are
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
drowned out and in this case cut out by
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
the Roar of corporate interests we must
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
reclaim our constitutional republic and
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
restore power to the hands of the people
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
we must banish the corrosive practices
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
where access and influence are bought
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
and sold like Commodities we must
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
Institute robust transparency measures
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the public knows who is
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
attempting to buy influence or and for
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
what purpose even if that means it will
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
only be exposed by one representative at
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
a time most importantly we must also
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
work to empower ordinary citizens and
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
amplify their voices in the political
 
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
process because we work for them we need
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
to teach them to instruct us because as
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
we all should know they are our bosses
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
the forces armed against this level of
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
Engagement are powerful and well funded
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
but throughout history whenever our
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic was threatened
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
ordinary citizens have RI risen up to
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
demand change today I stand up here with
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
the courage and the determination to say
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
not on my watch let us all come together
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
across party lines and ideological
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
divides and defeat hb1 1215 let us show
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we want to operate in a political
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
system that truly represents the will of
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
the people in this case the thousands of
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
Hampton residents let us never forget
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the power to bring about change
 
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:33.800 align:start position:0%
lies not in the hands of the few but in
 
01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
the collective will of the many please
 
01:55:38.589 --> 01:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
vote R and oppose the committee report
 
01:55:38.599 --> 01:55:40.069 align:start position:0%
vote R and oppose the committee report

muns thank you Mr Speaker and uh good
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
morning colleagues
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of the committee of
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
conferences report on hb1
 
01:56:01.390 --> 01:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
1215 the Hampton Beach Casino ballroom
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
is not a large gaming venue the name
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
Casino goes back to
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
1899 when it was established as a dance
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
hall for at least the past 50 years it
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
has been a music venue hosting popular
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
groups such as the Beach Boys Bonnie
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
rayot and when they were just starting
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
out years ago you twoo the ballroom is
 
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
the engine that drives the economy at
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach and it contributes
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
significantly to the economic well-being
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire people come to the
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
ballroom to see a show go out to eat at
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
a local restaurant which generates rooms
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
and meals tax
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
revenue but it has reached the end of
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
its useful life and the owners of the
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
ballroom know that it needs to be
 
01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
replaced in addition to owning the site
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
if we're having conversations we should
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
room in addition to owning the site upon
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
which the existing Ballroom sits which
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
is between D and F streets the owners of
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the ballroom also own a parcel of land
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the north between D and C streets
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
they want to integrate that land into
 
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
the footprint of the new development
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
proposing before the owners can submit
 
01:57:21.870 --> 01:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
their final design plans to the local
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
plan planning and zoning boards they
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
need to know if D Street will be closed
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
if the project is
 
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
approved they also need to know if the
 
01:57:32.109 --> 01:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
town is willing to enter into a
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
long-term lease for land under the
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
street current law as you heard only
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
permits leases up to 5
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
years now a few things about D Street it
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
500 500t side street that sits on public
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
land in an urban area
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
with no homes on it that runs between
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
two Parcels of land owned by the same
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
land owner our Public Safety officials
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
have indicated there would be no Public
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
Safety or traffic issues if the road is
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
closed in fact traffic flow will
 
01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
probably be improved if the proposed
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment project is completed there
 
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
is no issue of eminent domain or taking
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
of private land since available
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
historical records indic indicate that
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
the land underneath D Street is already
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
owned by the town of
 
01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
Hampton I know many of you are
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
struggling with the fact that the voters
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
of Hampton would not have a direct say
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
in whether the road should be closed I
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
struggled that I struggled with that
 
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
myself and that is why when I wrote the
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
amendment I specified that the select
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
board can only make a decision to close
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
the road after they hold public hearing
 
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
public meetings with the Hampton
 
01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
planning board the Hampton Beach Village
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
district and the Hampton Beach area
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
commission and they hold two public
 
01:59:02.069 --> 01:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
hearings that does not skirt the process
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
of Civic involvement it provides for at
 
01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
least five public hearings which is
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
significantly more opportunity for
 
01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
public input than a single deliberative
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
session for input furthermore I have
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
enough confidence in our selected board
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
or select board which was in fact which
 
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
was after all elected by the people that
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
they will respect the opinion they
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
receive particularly if they want to get
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
reelected many of you may have also seen
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
a letter written by one of our select
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
board members I know and respect that
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
member but you need to know that her
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
opinion is hers alone and does not
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
reflect the opinion of our board in
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
addition you also need to know that both
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
our town manager and another member of
 
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
that same select board testified in
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment to HB 1215 when
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
the senate committee on elections and
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal Affairs held their public
 
02:00:01.149 --> 02:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
meeting you also need to know that the
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
supports hb1
 
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
1215 I know that by now all of you have
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
seen a copy of their letter of
 
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
support finally you need to know that
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
except for one person speaking out
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
against hb1 1215 at a recent select
 
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
board meeting there has been no local
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
outcry against either hb5 uh 1215 or the
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
proposed Redevelopment and I have only
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
received one email asking me about it
 
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
most of the people in Hampton I have
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
talked to are very supportive of this
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
project and the process we are
 
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
proposing and that is another point to
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
remember what hb1 1215 does is provide
 
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
the Hampton select board with an
 
02:00:49.229 --> 02:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
alternative process they can choose to
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
use to close D Street there is nothing
 
02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill that mandates or guarantees
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
a specific outcome not with respect to
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
whether D Street should be closed or
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
that the or what the terms of a
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
long-term lease might be or certainly
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
not whether the Redevelopment project
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
should go forward the owners of the
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
project understand that they are going
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
to have to go before the Hampton
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
planning board and the Hampton zoning
 
02:01:18.189 --> 02:01:18.199 align:start position:0%
board to obtain their their approval all
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're asking for right now is some
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
clarity on whether they can include the
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
land underneath D Street in their final
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
plans we have all received emails
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
expressing concerns about the precedent
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
that we the legislature would be setting
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass hb1
 
02:01:36.069 --> 02:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
12415 according to house committee
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
Services since
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
1999 there have been at least eight
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
instances where legislation was brought
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward to approve a specific action or
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
provide specific special legislative
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
permission required for or requested by
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
municipality most recently this year we
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
provided a one-time payment of
 
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
$191,000 to the town of
 
02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
Hamstead in addition if we are setting a
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
unique precedent by passing hb1 1215 it
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
is a very narrow one we would be
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
providing a select board elected by the
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
people with an option between now and
 
02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
next march to say it will close a 500t
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
side street that sits on public land in
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
an ear urban area with no homes on it
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
that runs between two Parcels of land
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
owned by the same landowner and then
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
leasing that land to the landowner if a
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
project proposed by the land order is
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
approved in accordance with local land
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
use regulations I don't know if you can
 
02:02:38.669 --> 02:02:38.679 align:start position:0%
get any narrower than
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
that finally we the state did our our
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
part 15 or 20 years ago when we upgraded
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure along the east side
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
of Ocean Boulevard and it looks fabulous
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
since since then there has been some
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
private Redevelopment but we needed the
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
owners of the ballroom to step up and
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
redevelop that property they are now
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
willing and eager to do so and they are
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
not asking for any direct investment of
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
public money in fact they have already
 
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
indicated that if there is any
 
02:03:12.069 --> 02:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure under D Street that needs
 
02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
to be relocated they will pay for that
 
02:03:17.550 --> 02:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
this is our opportunity to reach out and
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
offer them the very small helping hand
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
they are asking for and demonstrate that
 
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
we really do believe in public private
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
Partnerships please join me in

02:03:58.350 --> 02:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
won't take up too much time you keep
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the public hearings that
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
that have to be held is there any legal
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh compels elected
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
officials to vote or act in a manner
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with the majority position
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
hearing none that I'm none that I'm

the members of this body body as well
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that compels us to vote
 
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:28.520 align:start position:0%

02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
people in our town want us to vote thank
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker will the member yield to another

Speaker will the member yield to another
question

02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
question

02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
Mr speaker thank you for taking my
 
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
question I just I heard a new data point
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
from both speakers and I'm curious so
 
02:04:54.669 --> 02:04:54.679 align:start position:0%
I'm a bank the ballroom comes to me and
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
says we'd like to borrow $175 million
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to redo our whole Cino and
 
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to really build this thing
 
02:05:04.549 --> 02:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
out nice and I say well how are you
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
going to pay me back and they say well
 
02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
over 20 years we're going to pay you
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
back so much from the profits and here
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
our profit sheets this so much we
 
02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:12.390 align:start position:0%
our profit sheets this so much we
usually

02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
usually
 
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
make and and then I say okay but what's
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
this here about every five years so in
 
02:05:22.030 --> 02:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
five years the voters could shut you
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
down and all my money would be gone is
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
case I couldn't have said that better
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
myself yes that that would be a problem
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
for a bank uh if they saw that uh that
 
02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
provision representative cutab has
 
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call and it's been
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%

order the chair recognizes
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
know the right way the proper way to
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
address any ambiguity and statute would
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
be through the bill process that we go
 
02:07:38.669 --> 02:07:38.679 align:start position:0%
through which begins in January not
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
through a non- gerain Amendment and if I
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
know the current state law says that
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
once you have local approval of a
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
development you have two
 
02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
years to initiate active construction
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
and if that is done within 2 years you
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
receive an additional threeyear
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
exemption from any changes in land use
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
law and if I know that there is
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
substantial completion after 5 years
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
developers are permanently protected
 
02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
from changes to land use regulation
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
changes and if I know that time
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
increases cost then would I reject this
 
02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
needless doubling of exemptions by
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button to reject this
 
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative

02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
ballroom is not a gaming venue but one
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's leading music venues
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
that is seeking to redevelop and upgrade
 
02:08:42.669 --> 02:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
the property at their own expense and
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
with the support of the Hampton Chamber
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
of Commerce and if I know that to
 
02:08:48.510 --> 02:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
finalize and present their design to the
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate local planning and zoning
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
boards for their approval the owners
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
would like Clarity on whether D Street
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
will be closed and the property can be
 
02:08:58.830 --> 02:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
leased for 99 years and if I know that
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
under current law towns are only able to
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
lease land they own for no longer than 5
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
years and thus need legislative action
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
to assist the town to lease the property
 
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
and if I know that holding a special
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
town meeting to decide whether to close
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
D Street would not only cost over
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
$15,000 but conflict with the state
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
primary and general elections and impose
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on the residents of
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
Hampton and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
that if we adopt this Committee of
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
conference report Hampton will continue
 
02:09:29.549 --> 02:09:29.559 align:start position:0%
to have local control of the of the
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
decision whether to close D Street and
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
whether to approve or not approve the
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
proposed Redevelopment of the ballroom
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
Grant the Hampton select board the
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
option if they choose to exercise it
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
between now and March 2025 to decide to
 
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
close D Street and Lease the land
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
underneath it for up to 99 years but
 
02:09:52.270 --> 02:09:52.280 align:start position:0%

Mr speaker thank
 
03:52:12.750 --> 03:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
you I rise today to speak about hb1
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
1241 I originally Al was going to stand
 
03:52:19.110 --> 03:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
up and speak in opposition to the
 
03:52:21.910 --> 03:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill but I've changed my
 
03:52:24.269 --> 03:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
mind as
 
03:52:27.670 --> 03:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
anybody as every legislator should
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
maintain an open mind I've had
 
03:52:33.229 --> 03:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
conversations with several people during
 
03:52:36.510 --> 03:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
lunch and I actually went and had a
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
conversation at the
 
03:52:42.189 --> 03:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
treasury so that I could understand
 
03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
totally what the words mean because
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
Words As We Know mean everything
 
03:52:51.550 --> 03:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
especially when you're dealing with
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
shs because that's
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
mandatory and what was the other word
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
they used was
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
strive so no one strives to lose so if
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
you're striving to do something
 
03:53:08.149 --> 03:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
different then you're you're using a
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory positive force so in my
 
03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:15.469 align:start position:0%
mandatory positive force so in my
conversations

03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.389 --> 03:53:19.399 align:start position:0%
that this fund and its board that
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
oversees the fund is not going to do
 
03:53:29.149 --> 03:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
much uh to have an adverse effect on the
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
AAA Bond rating that we have and that
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
depends on the deposits and everything
 
03:53:38.710 --> 03:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
we put in our Pat
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
fund the money that was being talked
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
about was what's called float
 
03:53:47.710 --> 03:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
there's money that's kept in cash
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
because you
 
03:53:51.870 --> 03:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
have monies that come in monies that go
 
03:53:54.670 --> 03:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
out and that money has to be kept
 
03:53:58.269 --> 03:53:58.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere because it's not invested to
 
03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
where you get that great return that we
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
all expect and have seen it's deposited
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
in the banks so basically after reading
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
the three sentences and stuff it's kind
 
03:54:15.270 --> 03:54:15.280 align:start position:0%

03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
non-harmful shot across the bow as one
 
03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
might say where the banks are going what
 
03:54:25.750 --> 03:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
can we do to get a little
 
03:54:30.309 --> 03:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
more they hold a seat on that Bond
 
03:54:32.670 --> 03:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
Council and it was surprising they
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
didn't go to the bond Council they chose
 
03:54:37.750 --> 03:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
to go through the legislative process
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do something that's neither
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
here nor there but since I've been
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
talking to a lot of people
 
03:54:49.590 --> 03:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
about trying to defeat this I wanted to
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
stand here and
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
say because I have new information that
 
03:54:58.830 --> 03:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
my mind has changed and I think it would
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
be okay to pass this
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%

colleagues House Bill 1265 with s SP 219
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
attached requires school districts to
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
post expense information in a very
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
prescriptive way it violates local
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
control and even prohibits reasonable
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
explanation of budgets on the posters
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
that are required providing budget
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
information without acknowledging the
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
many changes in what we require of
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
public schools is deliberately
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
misleading and
 
04:02:46.590 --> 04:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
inflammatory this bill literally
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
specifies the paper size to be used talk
 
04:02:49.760 --> 04:02:50.870 align:start position:0%
specifies the paper size to be used talk
about

04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
micromanagement all of the information
 
04:02:54.510 --> 04:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
requested by the bill is currently
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
readily available on the Department of
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
Education website so simply publicizing
 
04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
that link on School District websites
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
would be effective communication please
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
join me in pressing the red button to
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
defeat this unnecessary
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
speaker part one of the bill is just
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
housekeeping it takes private acmis out
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
of a list so they don't have to file
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork that they don't have to
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
file but part two says that before
 
04:03:35.790 --> 04:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
budget meetings school districts will
 
04:03:39.149 --> 04:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
have to present to voters three simple
 
04:03:42.990 --> 04:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
graphs the average cost per pupil the
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
average teacher
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
salary and the administrative salaries
 
04:03:49.670 --> 04:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
and how they've trended over the past 10
 
04:03:51.870 --> 04:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
years and we'll have to present one
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
table that lists the top four
 
04:03:56.910 --> 04:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
administrative salaries in the district
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
and their titles this bill contains a
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
civil remedy section similar to our
 
04:04:03.630 --> 04:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
current RSA
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
91a and it would allow taxpayers to peti
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
petition the court if this information
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
is not provided according to law finally
 
04:04:13.950 --> 04:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference just
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
tightened up the definitions of what
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
appears in the graphs so that we'll be
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
comparing Apples to
 
04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
Apples but can't people find this
 
04:04:26.030 --> 04:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
information on their own well the
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
average taxpayer doesn't know where to
 
04:04:30.750 --> 04:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
look for this information and even if
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
they do it would take a lot of digging
 
04:04:35.790 --> 04:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
on the doeo website and School District
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
websites but it's easy for a school
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
district to get this information and to
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
put it together
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
why would we want the information
 
04:04:48.030 --> 04:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
besides the fact that a picture is worth
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
a thousand words we'll learn some things
 
04:04:53.070 --> 04:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
like maybe that per pupil costs have
 
04:04:56.309 --> 04:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
risen over the past 10 years but teacher
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
salaries have had a minimal increase in
 
04:05:00.550 --> 04:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
comparison or maybe that some
 
04:05:02.309 --> 04:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
administrators are making three times
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
what the average teacher salary is the
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
transparency provided in the
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
graphs helps taxpayers make more
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
decisions so how do we get this valuable

04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
that almost all of this information
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
is already available on the Department
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
of Education website under if Finance if
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
I know that this bill requires districts
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
to report budget data on graphs on two
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
pages that are 18 by 24 with only the
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
name and logo of the district to be
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
displayed in two places of business and
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
in a local paper and if I know that if
 
04:07:40.830 --> 04:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
any explanation of this that any
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
explanation of this data is prohibited
 
04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
and subject to a civil penalty so if you
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
agree with me that posting data with no
 
04:07:52.349 --> 04:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
explanation is misleading and also
 
04:07:54.990 --> 04:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to elected school boards
 
04:07:57.630 --> 04:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
and to the public please join me in
 
04:08:00.109 --> 04:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
pushing the red button to put an end to
 
04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
this unnecessary and disrespectful
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
Bill chair recognized representative
 
04:08:09.389 --> 04:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:08:15.149 --> 04:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
that this bill removes the requirement
 
04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
that publicy file Financial reports with
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
Education if I know that this bill would
 
04:08:24.990 --> 04:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
require school districts to provide the
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers with three simple line graphs
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
showing the average cost per pupil
 
04:08:33.149 --> 04:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
average teacher salaries and
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
administrator salaries over a period of
 
04:08:40.030 --> 04:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
10 years and one table showing the top
 
04:08:43.630 --> 04:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
four administrator salaries and titles
 
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
if I know that the average taxpayer
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't know how to find this
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
information but school districts have
 
04:08:53.790 --> 04:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
all the data and can easily provide it
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
in this clear and accessible
 
04:08:59.070 --> 04:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
format if I know that our local schools
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on local taxpayer dollars
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
and they should know where their money
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
is being spent and how that investment
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
is trending over
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
time and if I know that providing this
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
transparency to the taxpayers will help
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
to promote productive local
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Association of counties
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill because it puts County

correctional facilities in a vulnerable
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
position opening the county to

correctional facilities have the ability
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%

federal and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
that this bill would require local

lack due process and are issued without

a warrant or judicial oversight and we
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
know that hundreds of US citizens have

compel local supervisors of the

current interval of 10
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
years the consequence will be that many
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire citizens will
 
04:21:29.149 --> 04:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
routinely find that when they go to the
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
polls to vote their name is not on the
 
04:21:33.000 --> 04:21:34.309 align:start position:0%

indignation and
 
04:21:42.109 --> 04:21:42.119 align:start position:0%

provisional ballot and pro and produce
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%

04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
already done
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
that many
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
citizens only vote in presidential
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%

midterm
 
04:22:18.670 --> 04:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
elections and many of those will
 
04:22:21.790 --> 04:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
occasionally skip a presidential
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
election sometimes because imagine this
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
they don't like either of the candidates
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
nominated by the major
 
04:22:31.870 --> 04:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
parties sometimes because they can't get
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
off work so they miss an
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
election under this bill those voters
 
04:22:41.109 --> 04:22:41.119 align:start position:0%

04:22:44.349 --> 04:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
One election
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
will be at risk to have their names
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
purged from the voting
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
list that experience I predict will
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
amplify those voters sense of
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
alienation from the formal institutions
 
04:23:00.920 --> 04:23:01.750 align:start position:0%

parties from voting
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
itself I think it will cause it will
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
enlarge the class of those citizens who
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
are Perman

non-voters yes to be
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
sure before your name is Struck from the
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
list you'll receive a postcard from the
 
04:23:22.870 --> 04:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the
 
04:23:26.109 --> 04:23:26.119 align:start position:0%
checklist asking you to
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
respond and defend your right to
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
vote some will respond and their name
 
04:23:36.429 --> 04:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
will stay on the checklist but
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
others will not they'll be confused
 
04:23:41.590 --> 04:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
about why they're receiving a postcard
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
why are they a Cit citizen who hasn't
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
moved whose residence hasn't changed
 
04:23:49.630 --> 04:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
whose status as a citizen hasn't changed
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
at all why do they have to defend their
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
right to vote they'll be confused about
 
04:23:58.510 --> 04:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
that and they'll wonder what's
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
up some will just not see the postcard I
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't know about your house but in in my
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
house my children seem to think that
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
everything that arrives in the mail is

04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
this bill voting lists have to be

districts and update lists accordingly
 
04:25:29.550 --> 04:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's the lowcost super accurate
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
solution to maintaining voting lists
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
this bill by contrast is not a solution
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
to anything it will make our voting list
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
less accurate not more accurate it will
 
04:25:43.189 --> 04:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
confuse our citizenry it will make
 
04:25:46.510 --> 04:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
citizens angry it will force law-abiding
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
taxpaying citizens to defend their right
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
to vote for no reason whatsoever it will
 
04:25:54.109 --> 04:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise lots of citizens and it
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
will create a permanent class of
 
04:26:00.510 --> 04:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
non-voters suspicious and alienated this
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill is not a solution to a problem it's
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
a whole new bundle of problems we should
 
04:26:05.840 --> 04:26:08.750 align:start position:0%
a whole new bundle of problems we should
oppose

04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
it vote against the committee report I
 
04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
would urge you so that we can non-c
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
concur thank
 
04:26:22.710 --> 04:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
qua thank you Mr
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill is passed by the
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
house would indeed
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
Institute an update of the checklist
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
every four years the house version had a
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
four-year look back meaning they would
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
check the previous four years to see if
 
04:26:44.469 --> 04:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
someone on the checklist had
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
voted the position as agreed between the
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house in the committee of
 
04:26:53.469 --> 04:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
conference exceeded to the Senate's
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
preference for a six-year look back
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
period I did the I did the math someone
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
can check me if I'm right but I count 14
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
elections in each jurisdiction during
 
04:27:07.389 --> 04:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
that six years that means in order to be
 
04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
removed from the checklist under this
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
bill you would need to Miss 14
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
consecutive elections including
 
04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal State primary presidential
 
04:27:23.790 --> 04:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
primary and general election for six
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
years that's what the bill has agreed to
 
04:27:30.269 --> 04:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference would
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
do now the purpose of this bill in my
 
04:27:36.510 --> 04:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
view is to
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
reduce the possibility the likelihood of
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
someone attempting to take advantage
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
systematic way let's say of a 10-year
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
accumulation of names and addresses on
 
04:27:52.269 --> 04:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
the checklist which are no longer
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
valid I see that as a
 
04:27:56.510 --> 04:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and I think it's Our
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
obligation to address that vulnerability
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
with this bill because in considering
 
04:28:03.870 --> 04:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
why we're doing this we have an election
 
04:28:06.670 --> 04:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
law system in my mind the purpose of
 
04:28:09.870 --> 04:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
this election election law system is to
 
04:28:12.189 --> 04:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
assure that our governments all of them
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
have the consent of the government and
 
04:28:16.990 --> 04:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
the way it our elections fulfill this
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
purpose is to make an accurate
 
04:28:21.109 --> 04:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
assessment of public sentiment or the
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
will of the public the will of the
 
04:28:24.040 --> 04:28:26.670 align:start position:0%
will of the public the will of the
people

04:28:26.670 --> 04:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
while ensuring also public trust and
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
confidence in that election system now
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of an accurate assessment I see
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:35.990 align:start position:0%
in terms of an accurate assessment I see
three

04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:28:36.000 --> 04:28:37.710 align:start position:0%
three
elements

04:28:37.710 --> 04:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
elements
 
04:28:40.109 --> 04:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
first we have to ensure that all
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
qualified voters have the opportunity to
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
cast a ballot while also ensuring that
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
no no one who is unqualified to vote
 
04:28:48.990 --> 04:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
gets that
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the others are obviously
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
secrecy of the ballot and an accurate
 
04:28:55.950 --> 04:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
tabulation of the votes so this bill
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
focuses on the first of those elements
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
the equal obligation we have to ensure
 
04:29:02.189 --> 04:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
all qualified voters get to cast a
 
04:29:05.710 --> 04:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
ballot and no one who's unqualified gets
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
to do so and the reason that's important
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
is because every time an unqualified
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
someone is not qualified to vote cast a
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
ballot they damage the franchise of
 
04:29:16.510 --> 04:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
everyone who is qualified to
 
04:29:18.910 --> 04:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
vote and this is I think a
 
04:29:20.670 --> 04:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward way to reduce the
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
likelihood of un people who are not
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote from getting to cast a
 
04:29:28.349 --> 04:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
ballot so in
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
summary six-year look back 14 straight
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
elections someone didn't vote and we're
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
obligated to do this to ensure the value
 
04:29:38.429 --> 04:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
of the franchise for those who are
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote so I ask you to press
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
the green button to concur with the
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh the committee of a conference
 
04:29:52.590 --> 04:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
report thank you all very much for your
 
04:29:55.109 --> 04:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
time a division has been requested
 
04:29:56.590 --> 04:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
members take your seats this will be a
 
04:29:56.600 --> 04:30:10.950 align:start position:0%
members take your seats this will be a
division

04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.429 --> 04:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to adopt the
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
committee of competence report on 1369
 
04:30:52.229 --> 04:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
this a division vote chair recognized
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.349 --> 04:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
bill will confuse and anger lots of
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
citizens who are forced to defend their
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
right to vote for no
 
04:31:11.550 --> 04:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
reason if I know that this bill will
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
create less accurate not more accurate
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
voting lists and if I know that this
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
bill is likely to disenfranchise lots of
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
Voters voters with loyalties to both
 
04:31:25.229 --> 04:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
parties and Independence as well than
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
what I vote red to oppose this committee
 
04:31:30.750 --> 04:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
report chair recognize represent quirley
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.710 --> 04:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
inquir thank you Mr
 
04:31:40.990 --> 04:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that we are obligated
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that only qualified voters get
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
to cast a ballot while ensuring that all
 
04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
qualified voters have that
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and if I know that 10 years
 
04:31:57.990 --> 04:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
between cleanups of the checklist is far
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
too long and generally results in too
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
large an accumulation of names and
 
04:32:04.429 --> 04:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
addresses on that checklist which are no
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
longer valid voter names and
 
04:32:10.109 --> 04:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
addresses and if I know that this bill
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
is adopted as a presented in the
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
report employs a six-year look back
 
04:32:20.349 --> 04:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
every four years which means 14 straight
 
04:32:22.510 --> 04:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
elections would have to be missed by
 
04:32:24.670 --> 04:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
someone on the checklist before they are
 
04:32:27.670 --> 04:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
removed but they then vote green to
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
adopt this Common Sense measure to help
 
04:32:33.070 --> 04:32:33.080 align:start position:0%

exceptions represent Steven Smith mes
the

04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:11.070 --> 04:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
adoption Representative Steven Smith
 
04:34:12.750 --> 04:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
moves the adoption option the committee
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
of conference report on House Bill
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you Mr Speaker um I rise
 
04:34:28.029 --> 04:34:28.039 align:start position:0%
today uh in opposition to the committee
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
of conference report to upend our
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
traditional New Hampshire
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
elections first I want to stress that
 
04:34:39.070 --> 04:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
this is not simply a voter ID Bill we
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
already require that a voter provide
 
04:34:45.429 --> 04:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
identification when registering to vote
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
if they do not and do not submit proof
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
up to 7 days after the election their
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
ballot is
 
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
denied this bill goes much much further
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
it requires that voters present proof of
 
04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
citizenship in order to register to
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
vote if this law were to be adopted New
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be the only state in the
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
nation to have this requirement so why
 
04:35:21.189 --> 04:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
haven't other states required it well
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
there are several
 
04:35:26.590 --> 04:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
reasons first only two documents can
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
prove that you are a citizen of the
 
04:35:31.230 --> 04:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
United States if you're born here that's
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
your birth certificate or your passport
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
if you are a naturalized citizen the
 
04:35:39.470 --> 04:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
only way that you can prove it is with
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
your passport or your National ation
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
papers many people have problems
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
obtaining these documents due to time
 
04:35:49.279 --> 04:35:50.189 align:start position:0%
obtaining these documents due to time
and

04:35:50.189 --> 04:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
cost according to a survey of
 
04:35:57.390 --> 04:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
Northeastern states only about 40% of
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
adults in the Northeast hold valid
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
unexpired passports passports cost about
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
$130 and they take up to eight weeks to
 
04:36:08.959 --> 04:36:09.869 align:start position:0%
$130 and they take up to eight weeks to
be

04:36:09.869 --> 04:36:09.879 align:start position:0%

04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
issued it takes up to six months and
 
04:36:14.039 --> 04:36:15.551 align:start position:0%

about

04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%

04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
papers many families simply do not have
 
04:36:24.750 --> 04:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
the money to spend on a birth
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%

Hampshire families have difficulty
 
04:36:36.910 --> 04:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
meeting their normal household expenses
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
so cannot afford to spend money to
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
obtain these documents
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
most New Hampshire residents were born
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
in another state so must contact their
 
04:36:50.109 --> 04:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
birth state for a birth
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
certificate it takes about three months
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
to get a birth certificate from
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
California or Illinois and about one
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
month to get one from
 
04:37:02.189 --> 04:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
Texas and then of course there are the
 
04:37:04.629 --> 04:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
associated fees with them that
 
04:37:07.390 --> 04:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
vary because of the difficulty of
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
obtaining these requisite documents to
 
04:37:12.990 --> 04:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
prove citizenship courts have
 
04:37:16.029 --> 04:37:16.039 align:start position:0%
consistently ruled laws requiring proof
 
04:37:19.390 --> 04:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
of citizenship to be
 
04:37:21.670 --> 04:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Kansas attempted to
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
require proof of citizenship in the two
 
04:37:28.029 --> 04:37:28.039 align:start position:0%
years that was on the that law was on
 
04:37:31.150 --> 04:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
the books over 30,000 people were
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised that's
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
12% of the voters who attempted to
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
register experts hired by the authors of
 
04:37:42.670 --> 04:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
the bill admitted that over
 
04:37:46.750 --> 04:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
99% of those disenfranchised voters were
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
US citizens the 10th Circuit Court
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
struck down the Kansas law and the US
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court refused to hear the case
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
which means it is now the law of the
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
land because the difficulty of obtaining
 
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
necessary documentation other states
 
04:38:06.910 --> 04:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
understand that if a voter falsely
 
04:38:10.029 --> 04:38:10.039 align:start position:0%
attests to citizenship they are guilty
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
of a felony in New Hampshire lying on a
 
04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
citizenship affidavit is a class B
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
felony that can land you in jail for up
 
04:38:22.590 --> 04:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
to seven years and result in a fee of up
 
04:38:22.600 --> 04:38:23.789 align:start position:0%
to seven years and result in a fee of up
to

04:38:23.789 --> 04:38:23.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:38:26.789 --> 04:38:26.799 align:start position:0%
$5,000 it would also lead to a lifetime
 
04:38:28.029 --> 04:38:28.039 align:start position:0%
ban on
 
04:38:30.670 --> 04:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
voting such a law could affect their
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
ability to obtain naturalization because
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
it shows a lack of good moral character
 
04:38:37.949 --> 04:38:37.959 align:start position:0%
and they could be
 
04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
deported with these potential penalties
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
Loom booming over them it is highly
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
unlikely that new that non-citizens will
 
04:38:47.279 --> 04:38:48.830 align:start position:0%
unlikely that new that non-citizens will
misrepresent

04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
misrepresent
 
04:38:52.910 --> 04:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship the risks are just too high
 
04:38:54.990 --> 04:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
a few years ago New Hampshire spent
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
about $5 million trying to defend
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
another law that limited a voter's right
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
to cast a ballot the now Infamous
 
04:39:05.789 --> 04:39:05.799 align:start position:0%
sb3 this law is destined for the same
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
fate and we will once again incur
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
millions of legal fees simply because
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
because we refuse to believe the data or
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
learn from other states now let's turn
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the big Showcase of this law it's the
 
04:39:24.750 --> 04:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
hotline which will replace
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
affidavits how is the hotline going to
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
work well that's a really good question
 
04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
and it's one that not even our secretary
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
of state could answer he was unable to
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
answer questions definitively about the
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
hotline during the uh Committee of
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
conference including how many people
 
04:39:43.868 --> 04:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
would staff the hotline or how long a
 
04:39:45.868 --> 04:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
voter would be expected to wait while
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
their information is verified So in
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
theory you go to
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
vote you don't have the right documents
 
04:39:55.230 --> 04:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
an election official is going to call
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
this H hotline that is staffed by an
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
employee of the Secretary of State's
 
04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
office the AG's office and any other
 
04:40:05.070 --> 04:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
state agencies yet to be determined this
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
group of government employees will
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to verify the voter's missing
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
information using databases of yet to be
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
identified State agencies and they're
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
not sure what is in those state agency
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
those state agency databases at least as
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee of conference when
 
04:40:26.190 --> 04:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
asked whether this hotline could be in
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
effect on Election Day the secretary of
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
state has stated that it would be
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
difficult and if not implemented
 
04:40:36.910 --> 04:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
correctly it will lead to long lines and
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
voters leaving the polling places
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
without voting
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
according to the Lebanon town clerk they
 
04:40:43.920 --> 04:40:45.070 align:start position:0%
according to the Lebanon town clerk they
had

04:40:45.070 --> 04:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
897 same day voter registrations during
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
the 2022 general election based on the
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
experience they can assume about 50% of
 
04:40:57.310 --> 04:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
these voters might not have all the
 
04:40:57.320 --> 04:41:03.310 align:start position:0%
these voters might not have all the
required

04:41:03.310 --> 04:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.190 --> 04:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
documentation this means potentially
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
449 people will need verification tying
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
up three phone lines for 20 minutes per
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
call allowing 126 people to be processed
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
in 14 hours so we will have
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
automatically disenfranchised over 300
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
people other issues raised by Town
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
clerks point out that there is no real
 
04:41:30.510 --> 04:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
way for the people on the other end of
 
04:41:33.150 --> 04:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
the hotline to verify that the caller is
 
04:41:35.550 --> 04:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
actually an election official they are
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
going to be calling from their personal
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
cell phones and what if the cell phone
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
service is lousy or
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-existent no reasons were given by
 
04:41:48.510 --> 04:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
either the primary sponsor of this bill
 
04:41:50.948 --> 04:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
or the Secretary of State and let me
 
04:41:53.670 --> 04:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
remind you that this bill has never had
 
04:41:54.830 --> 04:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
a public
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
hearing if a voter's information is not
 
04:42:00.990 --> 04:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
verified by the hotline they get two and
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
a half days to go to court and the court
 
04:42:05.470 --> 04:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
fee is
 
04:42:08.510 --> 04:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
$280 and good luck getting the result
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
from any Court in two days so now we
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
have all these new procedures to
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
implement by September 10th over this
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
summer this means that in three months
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
time the secretary of state must design
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
the hotline system publish a new
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
election manual and then educate the
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of local election officials
 
04:42:34.910 --> 04:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
across the
 
04:42:37.948 --> 04:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
state and our voters will need to
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
immediately begin obtaining all that
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
documentation that I talked about
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
earlier and even if they're diligent
 
04:42:47.230 --> 04:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
many of them will not be able to do so
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
the governor has recently stated that
 
04:42:52.910 --> 04:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
you never want to implement something
 
04:42:56.110 --> 04:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
too fast and too drastic in a short
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
period of time that could potentially
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
cause any sort of
 
04:43:04.270 --> 04:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
disruption into the system and then most
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
importantly when you have to pay to go
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
to court perhaps the most dangerous
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing about this bill is that the New
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be at risk at losing our
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
Motor Voter exemption neither the
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor of this bill nor the
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State have spoken with the
 
04:43:26.550 --> 04:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to ask them to con
 
04:43:28.990 --> 04:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
to confirm that this bill won't have us
 
04:43:31.628 --> 04:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
lose our exemption so what happens if we
 
04:43:34.110 --> 04:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
lose our exemption well we would have to
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
spend millions of dollars to immediately
 
04:43:39.868 --> 04:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
get into compliance with Motor Voter and
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
we will incur more legal fees fighting
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
to protect our exemption second it will
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
allow thirdparty groups to register
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
voters it will not be the exclusive
 
04:43:55.390 --> 04:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
province of Clerks anymore our exemption
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
requires that every voter must be able
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
to vote on Election Day this bill
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly jeopardizes our exemption
 
04:44:07.310 --> 04:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
but we are still going forward without
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
fully examining this critical issue and
 
04:44:13.590 --> 04:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
once we lose the exemption we can't get
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
it back the secretary of state has not
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
expressed support for this bill and the
 
04:44:23.230 --> 04:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire City and Town's clerks
 
04:44:27.390 --> 04:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
Association is vehemently opposed New
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections are safe and secure
 
04:44:32.910 --> 04:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have to take my ADI my word
 
04:44:36.270 --> 04:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
for it secretary scanland Governor cunu
 
04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
the special committee on voter
 
04:44:40.470 --> 04:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
confidence your local election officials
 
04:44:42.030 --> 04:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
they all agree
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
just also look at the data we are
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
risking the hard work we have done since
 
04:44:50.670 --> 04:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
2020 to instill confidence in our
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
election system with a bill that rushes
 
04:44:58.270 --> 04:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
to overhaul a tried and true system with
 
04:45:01.230 --> 04:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
an untested theoretical system that has
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
serious constitutional problems exposes
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
us to losing Motor Voter exemption and
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
will create long line for voters and
 
04:45:11.788 --> 04:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
turmo turmoil
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
for our local election officials this
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill will disrupt our upcoming elections
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
and disenchant disenfranchised voters if
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
you want to improve our system let's do
 
04:45:26.350 --> 04:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
it thoughtfully and take the time to do
 
04:45:29.550 --> 04:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
it right not like this support your
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%

Mr Mr Speaker I would like a roll call

04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%

04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker the simple fact is for our
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
election system to be valid and function
 
04:46:10.320 --> 04:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
election system to be valid and function
properly

04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
we are equally obligated to ensure that
 
04:46:19.230 --> 04:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
all qualified voters can cast a ballot
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
and also that no unqualified no one who
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
is unqualified to vote gets the
 
04:46:27.788 --> 04:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity a present system
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
where literally anyone in the world from
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the world from anywhere in
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
the country can walk into the polling
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
place in New Hampshire assert with no
 
04:46:39.070 --> 04:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
supporting evidence whatsoever that they
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
are a qualified voter
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh by means of signing an
 
04:46:46.590 --> 04:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit completely ignores the
 
04:46:49.628 --> 04:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
necessity to ensure that only qualified
 
04:46:51.868 --> 04:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
voters get to cast a
 
04:46:55.548 --> 04:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
ballot this bill as passed by the house
 
04:47:00.270 --> 04:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
did remove all exceptions to uh proving
 
04:47:00.280 --> 04:47:01.110 align:start position:0%
did remove all exceptions to uh proving
your

04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
qualification if you weren't already
 
04:47:05.350 --> 04:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
registered to
 
04:47:09.628 --> 04:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
vote the Senate's view was that we
 
04:47:11.708 --> 04:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
should add a means of of supporting
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
people who were rejected by a moderator
 
04:47:17.590 --> 04:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
and were grieved by that and wanted a
 
04:47:19.628 --> 04:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
further opportunity to appeal their case
 
04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
in real time on Election Day and
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
actually for three days afterwards as
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
well so they put into place a right to
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
judicial review essentially immediately
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
and an opportunity to get the support of
 
04:47:36.670 --> 04:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire in their
 
04:47:39.150 --> 04:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to verify that they were
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:47.310 --> 04:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
you vote green to accept the committee
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
of conference
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
report and
 
04:47:57.868 --> 04:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
therefore reinforce the validity of our
 
04:48:00.430 --> 04:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
election system and support the trust
 
04:48:02.070 --> 04:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
and confidence of our voters that they
 
04:48:06.030 --> 04:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
know their votes are not being diluted
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
devalued by people who were not entitled
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
to and we are facing if there's a
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
vulnerability which we have then I
 
04:48:16.548 --> 04:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
cannot calculate the the likelihood it
 
04:48:18.510 --> 04:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
will be exploited but I know that it can
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
be and this is one way to reduce that
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
much for what reason do a member rise to
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
make a motion of a higher priority State
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
your motion I move to table House Bill
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
1370 and I would ask for a division vote
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
it is a proper motion the motion before
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
us is the table House Bill
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
1376 the division has been asked for
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.920 --> 04:50:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
get

04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.590 --> 04:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to table House
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 1376 this a division vote chair
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
recognize representative whole for a
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
04:50:14.070 --> 04:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill started with a title relative to
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
durable and temper proof election
 
04:50:22.830 --> 04:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
containers for preserving
 
04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
ballots if I know that this bill when
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
addressed by the body behind us came out
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
it50 but magically on the floor changed
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
and became autop pass and then Mr
 
04:50:38.430 --> 04:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know the body behind us
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
adopt an amendment that did not have a
 
04:50:40.320 --> 04:50:41.830 align:start position:0%
adopt an amendment that did not have a
public

04:50:41.830 --> 04:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
hearing at all would I now vote to table
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
this such that this legislation could be
 
04:50:49.708 --> 04:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
taken up in a future session as the idea
 
04:50:52.270 --> 04:50:52.280 align:start position:0%

04:50:55.750 --> 04:50:55.760 align:start position:0%

04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker why would I stand up to oppose a
 
04:53:56.430 --> 04:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
bill at the last possible moment
 
04:54:00.030 --> 04:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:03.948 --> 04:54:03.958 align:start position:0%
batteries well Le let's let's take a
 
04:54:06.590 --> 04:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
look at the at the legislative history
 
04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
of this we have a law today that says no
 
04:54:11.470 --> 04:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
wet cell batter batter shall be disposed
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
of in a solid waste landfill facility or
 
04:54:16.430 --> 04:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
compos composting facility or
 
04:54:19.070 --> 04:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
incinerator whether in or whether in an
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
a waste energy facility or otherwise
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's the current law don't throw car
 
04:54:27.310 --> 04:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
batteries away pretty simple they leech
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
lots of sulfuric
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
acid we're changing that to no person
 
04:54:34.470 --> 04:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
shall dispose of any wet cell batteries
 
04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
today's law lithium ion batteries or
 
04:54:39.868 --> 04:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
electronic devices or solid weight in
 
04:54:43.430 --> 04:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
any waste Land Fill facility or
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
incinerator don't throw your iPad
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
away don't throw a lot of devices away
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate the intent of the
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill the problem is we're going to
 
04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
penalize people per the current
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
statute what is the current penalty we
 
04:55:00.590 --> 04:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
we asked that on Monday
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
night any person who violates any of the
 
04:55:07.510 --> 04:55:07.520 align:start position:0%

subject to a civil penalty not to exceed

$225,000 are we really sure that we want
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
our citizens charge $25,000 because they
 
04:55:38.750 --> 04:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
happen to throw their iPad in the trash
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
I've spent 20 years working on lithium
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
batteries I probably know more than
 
04:55:49.310 --> 04:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
anybody in this room relative to lithium

Manchester in 2004 I was part of a
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
Development Group that burned down a lab
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
it wasn't our fault it was a supplier
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
out of um the automotive groups who had
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
sent over a prototype battery we plugged
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
it in the charge that night it was on
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
top of a carpeted floor
 
04:56:12.910 --> 04:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold the device caught on
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
fire burning down a second floor lab on
 
04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
Commercial Street in Manchester I'm very
 
04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with lithium ion battery
 
04:56:25.590 --> 04:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
fires I asked the sponsor I said what
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
chemistries are we talking about well
 
04:56:30.150 --> 04:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
lithium ion I'm like are we talking
 
04:56:32.110 --> 04:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
about lithium iron phosphate we talking
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
about lithium iron Cobalt lithium mag
 
04:56:37.270 --> 04:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
magnesium which chemistry well we're
 
04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
talking about lithium ion I appreciate
 
04:56:41.230 --> 04:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
apprciate that we want to start
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
recycling these it's a great idea we
 
04:56:46.030 --> 04:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
should all be good stewards of our
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
devices returning to them to recycling
 
04:56:51.868 --> 04:56:51.878 align:start position:0%
facilities is in the best interest of
 
04:56:54.510 --> 04:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
our environment creating penalties and
 
04:56:56.670 --> 04:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
new statutes that penalize a kid for
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
throwing their toy toy away with civil
 
04:57:02.590 --> 04:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
fines up to $25,000 is a bad idea I
 
04:57:04.190 --> 04:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would oppose this
 
04:57:06.548 --> 04:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
such that a a bill that addresses all of
 
04:57:08.430 --> 04:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
these issues could be brought up in a in
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
a future session thank you
 
04:57:22.110 --> 04:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.910 --> 04:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.920 --> 04:57:29.548 align:start position:0%
 
Speaker

04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues this is a very important
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
merely prohibits the disposal of lithium
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
ion batteries and solid Wasteland fill
 
04:57:44.110 --> 04:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
facilities composting facilities or
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
incinerators because we know we've had
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshals and we've had um uh
 
04:57:55.190 --> 04:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
landfill facility uh supervisors and so
 
04:57:58.350 --> 04:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
on come to our committee and
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
testify that the fires that these
 
04:58:04.030 --> 04:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries can create are
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
horrific they are destructive they have
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
have damaged many uh some facil
 
04:58:13.910 --> 04:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
facilities and we're just looking to um
 
04:58:17.230 --> 04:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate that
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
problem this bill was heard in my
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
Committee in environment and agriculture
 
04:58:25.150 --> 04:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
it was passed out of our committee
 
04:58:28.548 --> 04:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
unanimously it passed through this house
 
04:58:31.390 --> 04:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
unanimously when it got to the Senate
 
04:58:34.548 --> 04:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
the Senate wanted to make some change an
 
04:58:38.110 --> 04:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill to just um change
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
some language that was
 
04:58:43.948 --> 04:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
um typographical errors and whatnot and
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
when they did when they made their
 
04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment their Amendment messed some
 
04:58:52.548 --> 04:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
things up they ended up adding a section
 
04:58:55.868 --> 04:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
which duplicated the definition of
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
computers and so what we had to do is
 
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
non-c concur with their uh Amendment and
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
so we found ourselves in a committee of
 
04:59:07.708 --> 04:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
conference where the sponsor of the bill
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
brought an amendment to fix the problem
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
that the Senate amendment
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
created there was no uh in the original
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
Bill and also the
 
04:59:22.750 --> 04:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the U the the Senate Amendment
 
04:59:24.110 --> 04:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
04:59:24.120 --> 04:59:25.708 align:start position:0%
there was no
changes

04:59:25.708 --> 04:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:59:30.750 --> 04:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
to the um the definition you
 
04:59:35.868 --> 04:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
know the whe there was no change to
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
penalties or anything else that was
 
04:59:40.548 --> 04:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
already established in statute
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
if we wish to change the penalties for
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
disposal incorrect disposal of uh any of
 
04:59:50.590 --> 04:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
these items we can do that next session
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
but I think it's of utmost importance
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we at
 
04:59:57.910 --> 04:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
least prohibit lithium ion batteries
 
05:00:00.990 --> 05:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
from being disposed into the trash and
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.910 --> 05:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous we uh the the um
 
05:00:17.150 --> 05:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
there is in uh RSA 149 dmon 27 where we
 
05:00:20.708 --> 05:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
talk about prohibited disposal um item
 
05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
number three a says No Leaf or yard
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
waste shall be disposed of in a solid
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
waste landfill or incinerator including
 
05:00:30.670 --> 05:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
any waste to energy facility any person
 
05:00:32.990 --> 05:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
who violates this paragraph shall be
 
05:00:34.948 --> 05:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
subject to the penalties and enforcement
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
149-156 and in that provision is where
 
05:00:45.548 --> 05:00:45.558 align:start position:0%
the penalties are identified we made no
 
05:00:47.868 --> 05:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
changes with this bill to any of the
 
05:00:51.150 --> 05:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
penalties we just merely said that um
 
05:00:52.990 --> 05:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries should not be
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
disposed in landfills or incinerators or
 
05:00:57.788 --> 05:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
these other
 
05:01:01.868 --> 05:01:01.878 align:start position:0%
facilities so you know basically this is
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
a really good bill I think if we want to
 
05:01:07.110 --> 05:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
come back and talk about um changing the
 
05:01:09.548 --> 05:01:09.558 align:start position:0%
penalties at some further point in time
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
then that would be an appropriate thing
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
to do but I encourage you and I urge you
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%

with not one person testifying in

opposition if I know that this bill
 
05:03:10.948 --> 05:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
Banning the disposal of lithium ion
 
05:03:14.190 --> 05:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
batteries is a top priority of the solid
 
05:03:17.708 --> 05:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
waste industry to remove toxic waste
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
from the waste stream and to decrease
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
fire risk
 
05:03:25.150 --> 05:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities the State Fire Marshall
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
and The Association of Fire Chiefs all
 
05:03:30.750 --> 05:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
due to their extreme fire
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
risk if I know that many items of
 
05:03:36.750 --> 05:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
electronic waste are already banned from
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
disposal and this updates the list and
 
05:03:40.080 --> 05:03:40.830 align:start position:0%
disposal and this updates the list and
the

05:03:40.830 --> 05:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
definition and that the existing law
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
Banning electronic waste disposal along
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
with yard waste and wet cell
 
05:03:51.470 --> 05:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
batteries uh will remain in place
 
05:03:54.990 --> 05:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether this bill passes
 
05:03:58.270 --> 05:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
and if I know this bill only adds
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries and some electric
 
05:04:04.030 --> 05:04:04.040 align:start position:0%

conference report was necessary only to

Ander thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker um
 
05:07:20.548 --> 05:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
hp400 is a bunch of different bills
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
together um one is the compromise a
 
05:07:25.548 --> 05:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
modest compromise on parking reform it
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
allows the free market to determine how
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
many parking spaces are needed for
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
multif family developments that language
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
or more stringent language pass the
 
05:07:37.628 --> 05:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
house twice so this is moving towards um
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
more freedom for developers to for
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
multif family developments additionally
 
05:07:44.670 --> 05:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
um we added a careful compromise
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
language between tenants rights
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
Advocates and housing providers that
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
allows an opportunity for a landlord um
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
to file a brief in court to evict
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
somebody who is squatting on their
 
05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
property um in 48 hours without this
 
05:08:00.910 --> 05:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
provision landlords would have to wait 9
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
to 11 weeks to evict somebody that is
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
squatting in their house so this is a a
 
05:08:07.708 --> 05:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
protection for housing providers and
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
tenants rights Advocates support this
 
05:08:13.110 --> 05:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
Vision as well we also added amended
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
language to allow municipalities to
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
create a tax cut for those that convert
 
05:08:18.548 --> 05:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
office spaces to residential
 
05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
developments this is crucial uh language
 
05:08:23.150 --> 05:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
that would help uh alleviate the housing
 
05:08:25.110 --> 05:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
crisis and this language sunsets in 10
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
years so this is a temporary solution
 
05:08:29.470 --> 05:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
that will allow municipalities to do
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
more with the office spaces that are not
 
05:08:33.548 --> 05:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
currently being used so with that I
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support the committee
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
of conference report thank
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.270 --> 05:08:46.280 align:start position:0%

Speaker
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
hb14 is an Omnibus Bill that I'll call
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
The Good the Bad and the Ugly actually
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's the neutral the Bad and the Ugly
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the neutral and that's
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
sections 2 to7 of the bill which is the
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
anti- squatter legislation I'm not going
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
to speak to this as I think there are
 
05:09:07.270 --> 05:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
positives and negatives there maybe
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
others plan to speak on that
 
05:09:12.270 --> 05:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
let's start with the bad which is the
 
05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
original Bill
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
1400 what this would do is amend current
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
par parking rsas from shall not require
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
more than two spaces residential spaces
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
down to 1.5 for some
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios interestingly a town such as
 
05:09:30.548 --> 05:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
gtown already requires two spaces in
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
their zoning and the town of Salem and
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
some reaching projects uh have done
 
05:09:39.390 --> 05:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
parking requirements from 1.3 to 1.7 the
 
05:09:42.030 --> 05:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
Point here is that the M municipalities
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
working with their zoning regulations
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
and developers of the projects have
 
05:09:47.948 --> 05:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
tailored the parking requirements to
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
meet their local needs this change to
 
05:09:52.750 --> 05:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
the rsas is not needed or desired
 
05:09:54.830 --> 05:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities configure parking
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
requirements without the top- down
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
mandates now we'll go to the
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
ugly the other body talked uh tacked on
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
S SP 538 which we call an omnus Bill
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
within this omnus bill that bill Bill we
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
killed in this body a little over a
 
05:10:11.520 --> 05:10:12.350 align:start position:0%
killed in this body a little over a
month

05:10:12.350 --> 05:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:10:16.350 --> 05:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
ago it's back with some changes as a
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
reminder six section 8 and nine of that
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
was the community uh revitalization tax
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
relief now this was originally meant in
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
the irsa for the rehabilitation of
 
05:10:29.708 --> 05:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
dilapidated buildings now the definition
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
would add office conversions Industrial
 
05:10:33.548 --> 05:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
and Commercial Property
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
conversions it would permit the
 
05:10:37.390 --> 05:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
governing body of the municipalities to
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
Grant tax relief for up to 30 years of
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
course anytime you grant property tax
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
relief on one property the ones in this
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
case that are being revitalized it would
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
be spread to all the other taxpayers in
 
05:10:51.750 --> 05:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
that municipality this is
 
05:10:54.190 --> 05:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
redistribution section 12 talks about
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
alternative adoption to zoning this
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
without question is the most honorous
 
05:11:02.350 --> 05:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
piece of this uh s SP 538 if approved it
 
05:11:04.430 --> 05:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
would allow the governing body to J
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
change the zoning in a m municipality at
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
will without the vote of the local
 
05:11:12.310 --> 05:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
legisl body if and when adopted there is
 
05:11:14.990 --> 05:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
no mechanism to retract the RSA language
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
as most other rsas similar to this do
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
allow you could you could go through and
 
05:11:23.510 --> 05:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
figure out some uh scenarios here where
 
05:11:26.548 --> 05:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh you vote this in the select board
 
05:11:28.750 --> 05:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
changes or the the makeup of the
 
05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
municipality citizens changes
 
05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
politically doesn't matter what side of
 
05:11:34.590 --> 05:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
the aisle you're on your own town your
 
05:11:36.510 --> 05:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
town would then be stuck with allowing
 
05:11:42.190 --> 05:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
the other scenario of course would be uh
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
watching zoning being frequently
 
05:11:48.548 --> 05:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
whipsawed um it's very expensive to to
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
do zoning changes and that uh you could
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
actually see zoning changes whips off
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
from one way to the other over a matter
 
05:11:58.270 --> 05:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
of months the last one is alternative
 
05:12:00.628 --> 05:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
Parking Solutions as drafted there are
 
05:12:03.230 --> 05:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
four solutions that are proposed for
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
bypassing the current uh zoning
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for parking only one would
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
actually require parking for residents
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
of a development and that would be at a
 
05:12:14.708 --> 05:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
lot off-site location of another
 
05:12:16.990 --> 05:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
property owner when the property owner
 
05:12:19.948 --> 05:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
was not using his spaces so what happens
 
05:12:21.788 --> 05:12:21.798 align:start position:0%
when the property owner is using his
 
05:12:24.510 --> 05:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
spaces where where do the cars go the
 
05:12:26.350 --> 05:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
second would require ride share to
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
provide transportation for residents but
 
05:12:32.190 --> 05:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
to where doesn't say other parking to
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
their workplace to shopping no answer to
 
05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
these questions the third solution
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
public transport within a quarter of a
 
05:12:38.798 --> 05:12:40.030 align:start position:0%
public transport within a quarter of a
mile

05:12:40.030 --> 05:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
mile
 
05:12:43.390 --> 05:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
again to wear and finally no parking
 
05:12:45.628 --> 05:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
required again as long as there is quote
 
05:12:47.708 --> 05:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
unquote walkability
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure now what's interesting in
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
the same paragraph the committee of
 
05:12:53.310 --> 05:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
conference added language that directly
 
05:12:55.948 --> 05:12:55.958 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the next three paragraphs
 
05:12:58.548 --> 05:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
in the bill I'm assuming they meant to
 
05:13:00.190 --> 05:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
remove those three paragraphs but they
 
05:13:03.230 --> 05:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
did not so now we have two
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
paragraphs in direct conflict with each
 
05:13:10.230 --> 05:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
other in that uh particular
 
05:13:12.788 --> 05:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
paragraph here's my personal
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
favorite section 10 of the original s SP
 
05:13:19.390 --> 05:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
538 adds a new definition of qualifying
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
structure and in that new paragraph it
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
references RSA 79 e4d not important yet
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
here's the important part in the
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee of confence section
 
05:13:34.548 --> 05:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
14 it repeals that same referenced
 
05:13:37.470 --> 05:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
RSA so you're putting in a new
 
05:13:39.910 --> 05:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph reference an RSA and then in
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
the end you kill the irsa makes no sense
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
but what you're seeing here is a prime
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
example of why legislators should not be
 
05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
operating on the Fly meaning rushing
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislation without adequate time to
 
05:13:55.470 --> 05:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
review and assess what is being
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
proposed so in in conclusion while there
 
05:14:01.270 --> 05:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
is a piece regarding the antiqu anti-
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
squatters which may be helpful I'm
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
unaware that we have a problem in that
 
05:14:07.150 --> 05:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
area and the other pieces of this
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill uh hp14 00 and H and SP
 
05:14:13.548 --> 05:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
538 uh in my opinion are just too
 
05:14:15.470 --> 05:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
honorous to allow the passage of this
 
05:14:18.750 --> 05:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
legislation takes away local control
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
redistributes redistributes uh property
 
05:14:24.270 --> 05:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
taxes to residential and other taxpayers
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of a few businesses
 
05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
eliminates planning board involvement
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
giving selectman 100% of a control of
 
05:14:33.548 --> 05:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
zoning at will takes away the voters
 
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
right to uh vote on approving zoning
 
05:14:38.070 --> 05:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
changes think of that as losing checks
 
05:14:40.030 --> 05:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
and balances
 
05:14:42.670 --> 05:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
and again creates direct conflicts in
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
two separate areas of the bill so I
 
05:14:46.750 --> 05:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
would ask that you vote read against the
 
05:14:49.470 --> 05:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
motion to Concur and uh Mr Speaker I
 
05:14:51.150 --> 05:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
have I think I've already requested a
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
roll call thank
 
05:14:59.788 --> 05:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:03.230 --> 05:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr Speaker this bill
 
05:15:05.830 --> 05:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
allows for expedited hearing process for
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
landlords to remove squatters from
 
05:15:10.628 --> 05:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
rental units it also includes the same
 
05:15:12.830 --> 05:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
expedited hearing process for
 
05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
non-rental uh owners if you uh find
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
somebody squatting on your property when
 
05:15:18.990 --> 05:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
I first saw this bill I had some
 
05:15:20.910 --> 05:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about the 48h hour hearing
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
process for non-rental owners in my mind
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
that meant if you come home from
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
vacation and someone's in your house you
 
05:15:29.390 --> 05:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
can't call the police and have them
 
05:15:30.910 --> 05:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
removed you have to go through this 48
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
hour process through the court system
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the case uh and to ensure
 
05:15:37.830 --> 05:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
that we put some language in the bill
 
05:15:39.750 --> 05:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
that says nothing in this section shall
 
05:15:42.510 --> 05:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
be construed to prevent the arrest and
 
05:15:44.948 --> 05:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
prosecution of persons of a person for
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 6351 or two which is
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
Criminal Tres pass a
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
burglary um so an example of where this
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
might happen if you have like a vacation
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
home you show up there somebody's in it
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
and they say they rented it from an
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
Airbnb and they have um documentation
 
05:16:02.470 --> 05:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
that they did and this has happened
 
05:16:04.590 --> 05:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
before in that case the police might be
 
05:16:06.390 --> 05:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
leery of arresting somebody you should
 
05:16:08.110 --> 05:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
be afforded that same right of the 48
 
05:16:10.110 --> 05:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
hour process rather than waiting 6 to9
 
05:16:12.030 --> 05:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
weeks which is what we told it would
 
05:16:14.510 --> 05:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
take however we wanted to make sure that
 
05:16:16.590 --> 05:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
this is not a tool for law enforcement
 
05:16:19.788 --> 05:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
to circumvent arrest for probable cause
 
05:16:22.708 --> 05:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
of burglary or Criminal Trespass nor is
 
05:16:25.230 --> 05:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
it to be used as a defense for either

parking that are not needed as they are
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
better handled at the local level if I
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
also know this bill would spread

Owners if I know the most onerous
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
provision would allow the governing body
 
05:18:32.548 --> 05:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
rather than the citizens to change
 
05:18:34.230 --> 05:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
zoning laws that
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%

05:24:58.548 --> 05:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
have been fully informed of all
 
05:25:02.270 --> 05:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
information relevant to the activity you
 
05:25:04.670 --> 05:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
understand and agree in writing to the
 
05:25:07.590 --> 05:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
carrying out of the activity you
 
05:25:08.990 --> 05:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
understand that the the granting of
 
05:25:11.310 --> 05:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
consent is voluntary and you may revoke
 
05:25:14.830 --> 05:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
it at any time this mandatory process
 
05:25:17.830 --> 05:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
creates transparency and parental rights
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
and in protection for parent involvement
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
thus it negates the need for House Bill
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
1616 any Services can also be refused
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%

the local property taxpayer please vote
 
05:25:44.230 --> 05:25:44.240 align:start position:0%

Committee of conference
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:25:58.470 --> 05:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
two years ago a bill came through the
 
05:26:00.750 --> 05:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services committee so
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
that parents would need to consent to
 
05:26:05.430 --> 05:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
medical treatment in schools that is
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
what this bill amends this is not a bill
 
05:26:10.510 --> 05:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's limited to special education in
 
05:26:12.750 --> 05:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
the schools however this has to deal
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
with everything between a scraped knee
 
05:26:18.270 --> 05:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics and even more
 
05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
invasive procedures that may be
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
happening inside
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
schools this is an important bill
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
because initially when this bill was
 
05:26:29.230 --> 05:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
passed we had parents getting a form
 
05:26:31.750 --> 05:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
that said either you consent to
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
everything we want to do medically with
 
05:26:36.430 --> 05:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
your child or we won't give them an ice
 
05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
pack we had many many parents who would
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
not fill out that form as either
 
05:26:44.350 --> 05:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
everything or nothing and they wrote in
 
05:26:47.070 --> 05:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
the details this is a simple Common
 
05:26:49.868 --> 05:26:49.878 align:start position:0%
Sense way to make sure that the parent
 
05:26:51.910 --> 05:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
will agree to perhaps have them help
 
05:26:54.750 --> 05:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
monitor their child's diabetes or help
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
them monitor some other other areas and
 
05:26:59.948 --> 05:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
also to be informed if their child is at
 
05:27:02.548 --> 05:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
a concussion in school and make sure
 
05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
that they have to understand this this
 
05:27:07.150 --> 05:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
is simple common sense and deals with
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
every student not just special education
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
so in order to keep parents a critical
 
05:27:15.110 --> 05:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
part of the health of their children I
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
ask that you press the green button and
 
05:27:19.470 --> 05:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
support this bill and Mr Speaker I ask
 
05:27:22.030 --> 05:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
for a roll
 
05:27:24.270 --> 05:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
call the questions on the adoption of
 
05:27:26.670 --> 05:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
the conference report on House Bill 1616
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon requests a roll call
 
05:27:31.628 --> 05:27:31.638 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded it is this
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take
 
05:27:33.440 --> 05:27:37.110 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take

05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:12.750 --> 05:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:14.190 --> 05:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
the questions on the adoption of the
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
conference report on House Bill
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
1616 representative Bal Bon is
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.070 --> 05:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:31.868 --> 05:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this legislation
 
05:29:34.390 --> 05:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the delivery of
 
05:29:37.390 --> 05:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
services and parents already must give
 
05:29:40.510 --> 05:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
consent for for any changes to an i AP
 
05:29:42.510 --> 05:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
as well as annual permission to build
 
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid to schools
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
program and I know that requiring
 
05:29:48.750 --> 05:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
additional written consent for Medicaid
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
billing is not required by federal
 
05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
statute and will only disrupt medic
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to schools thus increasing
 
05:30:01.150 --> 05:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
costs to local school districts and
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and finally if I know that the
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
pilot Recruitment and Retention program
 
05:30:09.150 --> 05:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
was approved earlier in HB
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
1236 so that the spill is both fiscally
 
05:30:15.788 --> 05:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
irresponsible and unnecessary would I
 
05:30:18.270 --> 05:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
now press the red button to vote against
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%

05:30:23.910 --> 05:30:23.920 align:start position:0%

05:30:32.708 --> 05:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
in thank you Mr Speaker if I believe
 
05:30:35.948 --> 05:30:35.958 align:start position:0%
parent consent and approval is necessary
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
when schools bill for new or additional
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement Services Beyond
 
05:30:44.430 --> 05:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
those previously approved by the parent
 
05:30:47.030 --> 05:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
and if I also know an additional layer
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
of protections for taxpayers and the
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
child come from this bill and if I
 
05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
lastly know the bill as amended will
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
provide needed grant funding support to
 
05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%

05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
and argued against concurring on 16 1633
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
as amended by the Senate I must admit
 
05:35:43.868 --> 05:35:43.878 align:start position:0%
1633 is proving to be a pretty stubborn
 
05:35:47.310 --> 05:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
bill that refuses to Die the perplexing
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
thing about the immortality of this bill
 
05:35:52.510 --> 05:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
is that literally nobody in this body
 
05:35:53.910 --> 05:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
likes this
 
05:35:56.510 --> 05:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill two weeks ago the prime advocate
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
for this Bill said and I quote the
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
Senate made this bill the ugliest most
 
05:36:07.750 --> 05:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
and he was right then and that statement
 
05:36:13.788 --> 05:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
today the thing is the committee of
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
conference did little to address the
 
05:36:19.070 --> 05:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
ugliness of
 
05:36:22.548 --> 05:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
1633 1633 Remains the most intrusive big
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
government marijuana program proposed
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the country one that ignores
 
05:36:29.190 --> 05:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
free market principles will stifle
 
05:36:31.390 --> 05:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
innovation in an emerging industry and
 
05:36:33.470 --> 05:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
tie future generations of granite saders
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
to an inferior model
 
05:36:38.708 --> 05:36:38.718 align:start position:0%
indefinitely the ranking House member oh
 
05:36:40.510 --> 05:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
sorry the ranking house Democrat on the
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee the respectable
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative from Bartlett a man I
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
truly a woman I truly uh agree with and
 
05:36:49.548 --> 05:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
enjoy working with said in closing
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
comments last week on the committee of
 
05:36:53.948 --> 05:36:53.958 align:start position:0%
conference I want to make it clear I am
 
05:36:56.788 --> 05:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
signing off on this with a lot of angst
 
05:36:58.628 --> 05:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
those are not the words of somebody who
 
05:37:01.070 --> 05:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
is confident in their
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
position now the member from ringe the
 
05:37:06.788 --> 05:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
chairman of my committee a man I also
 
05:37:08.750 --> 05:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
greatly respect for his deep knowledge
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
he's our our official historian for our
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
committee and his grace in handling
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
disagreements within our committee
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
maintains The View that we should pass
 
05:37:20.190 --> 05:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
this deeply flawed Bill ugly bill
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
because we can fix it later while I
 
05:37:24.750 --> 05:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
trust his intentions I really do and I
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
do respect him I disagree with his
 
05:37:30.868 --> 05:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
thinking for two reasons first upon
 
05:37:32.628 --> 05:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
signing the Liquor Commission will
 
05:37:35.350 --> 05:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
immediately receive $8 million to start
 
05:37:37.548 --> 05:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
developing rules and infrastructure to
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
regulate this new government-run
 
05:37:42.788 --> 05:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry does anyone in here
 
05:37:45.030 --> 05:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
actually believe that we will be able to
 
05:37:47.868 --> 05:37:47.878 align:start position:0%
re reel in a newly empowered government
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy after they've spent millions
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
of dollars does anyone honestly believe
 
05:37:55.910 --> 05:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
it will be easy to pull back power from
 
05:37:59.910 --> 05:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
an unelected agency once they have it
 
05:38:02.990 --> 05:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
two the logic that we can fix something
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
next year is
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive because if next year we
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
have the ab ility to pass a new bill to
 
05:38:11.830 --> 05:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
fix this terrible one than we should
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
just pass a good bill next year one that
 
05:38:16.750 --> 05:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
decriminalizes starting in 2025 instead
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
of 2026 which is the current
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
timeline I like many in this room
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
seriously want to legalize cannabis
 
05:38:27.070 --> 05:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire but the fact is
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
despite the the member the member will
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
suspend there's not many of you left in
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
the room but yet it's louder than it
 
05:38:36.468 --> 05:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
normally is if you need to have a
 
05:38:38.430 --> 05:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
conversation that's what the back room
 
05:38:42.390 --> 05:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
is for member may continue I like many
 
05:38:44.750 --> 05:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
in this room seriously want to legalize
 
05:38:47.070 --> 05:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis sales in New Hampshire but the
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
fact is despite the recent tweaks this
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
remains a terrible Bill the same
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
terrible Bill we defeated two weeks ago
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
one that massively increases the size of
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
government by allowing it to take over
 
05:38:59.270 --> 05:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
an entirely new industry and opens the
 
05:39:00.990 --> 05:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
door for the possibility of rampant
 
05:39:03.510 --> 05:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
corruption and coronis as the
 
05:39:05.230 --> 05:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
well-connected vibe for an extremely
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
limited number of licenses
 
05:39:11.150 --> 05:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
in closing government is never more
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous than when our desire to have
 
05:39:15.830 --> 05:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
it help us blinds us from its great
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
power to harm us let's not let us not be
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:35.350 --> 05:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
rise today in support of house bill
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
1633 while my ideal model looks
 
05:39:43.070 --> 05:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
different I have this conference report
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
has my full support we have the
 
05:39:47.468 --> 05:39:47.478 align:start position:0%
opportunity today to make history as a
 
05:39:49.868 --> 05:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
25th state to legalize cannabis which
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
may fit tip Federal action there's
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
already discussion about descheduling
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
and there's disc there's discussion
 
05:39:58.110 --> 05:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
federally about changing the status of
 
05:40:00.350 --> 05:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
of cannabis within the country imagine
 
05:40:03.310 --> 05:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
if your vote today led to that change in
 
05:40:05.390 --> 05:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
federal policy where it no longer was
 
05:40:08.110 --> 05:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
ferally prohibited more importantly
 
05:40:09.830 --> 05:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
though today we have the chance to get
 
05:40:12.190 --> 05:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
the ball rolling in New Hampshire most
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill won't go into effect until
 
05:40:17.788 --> 05:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
2026 which gives us more time to fight
 
05:40:19.590 --> 05:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
about some of the challenges and some of
 
05:40:22.350 --> 05:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
the concerns we have about this bill I
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
plan to be back in this room working on
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
policy next year assuming that Dairy
 
05:40:30.270 --> 05:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
voters give me a third term in the house
 
05:40:31.948 --> 05:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
by the time we meet again in this
 
05:40:34.510 --> 05:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
chamber the people making that the
 
05:40:35.910 --> 05:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission will have started the
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
rules process and will know if we need
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
to make changes in order to better guide
 
05:40:43.468 --> 05:40:43.478 align:start position:0%
that process if the Control Commission
 
05:40:46.548 --> 05:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
has is a roadblock we will know if there
 
05:40:48.788 --> 05:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
are other problems we will know and we
 
05:40:50.670 --> 05:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
will have a legislative season that we
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
can do something about it and make the
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
changes because it is easier to make
 
05:40:58.270 --> 05:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
changes than to start something new and
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
upon passage people making normaliz
 
05:41:03.510 --> 05:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
purchases out of state will face a
 
05:41:06.468 --> 05:41:06.478 align:start position:0%
violation instead of a misdemeanor yes
 
05:41:08.510 --> 05:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's right criminalization will go up
 
05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
to 1 ounce which is what the purchase
 
05:41:12.510 --> 05:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
limits are in a lot of surrounding
 
05:41:14.468 --> 05:41:14.478 align:start position:0%
states which means that perhaps there'll
 
05:41:16.510 --> 05:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
be fewer than a thousand people arrested
 
05:41:18.910 --> 05:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
for possession next year like were in
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
2023 in New Hampshire so please join me
 
05:41:23.590 --> 05:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
in taking a step forward to make New
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire EST state where we can start
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
having Frank discussions about the risks
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
of cannabis instead of just pretending
 
05:41:31.548 --> 05:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
that making it illegal makes all the
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
problems go away please vote green and
 
05:41:36.350 --> 05:41:36.360 align:start position:0%

05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr Speaker it looks
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
like we all want to go home so I'll be
 
05:48:08.590 --> 05:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
as brief as I can this bill is pretty
 
05:48:12.750 --> 05:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward it uh changes from 400%
 
05:48:17.030 --> 05:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the federal property guidelines to
 
05:48:20.030 --> 05:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
425 per of the federal property
 
05:48:25.230 --> 05:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines in the EFA program now
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
1665 has an FM on it that means it's
 
05:48:33.230 --> 05:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
cost some money so I think uh that uh
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns but in my case I I
 
05:48:42.670 --> 05:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
submit to you that although I I support
 
05:48:45.350 --> 05:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
any family who wants to go outside the
 
05:48:47.830 --> 05:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
public school environment and educate
 
05:48:50.430 --> 05:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
their children I think that's that's
 
05:48:54.270 --> 05:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
fine if they're unhappy with our system
 
05:48:57.430 --> 05:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
however I have difficulty having the
 
05:49:01.070 --> 05:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:05.310 --> 05:49:05.320 align:start position:0%

luno thank you Mr
 
05:49:47.670 --> 05:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker in three years what have we
 
05:49:49.310 --> 05:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
learned about the education Freedom
 
05:49:49.320 --> 05:49:51.670 align:start position:0%
learned about the education Freedom
account

05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:49:55.070 --> 05:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
program we've learned more than 90 95%
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
of EFA kids were already in private or
 
05:50:00.110 --> 05:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
religious schools or in home schools
 
05:50:03.150 --> 05:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
before the EF Pro EFA program ever
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
existed and we've learned fewer than 5%
 
05:50:08.190 --> 05:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
of EFA students left their public
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
schools because of this program we've
 
05:50:12.830 --> 05:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
learned the Department of Education
 
05:50:15.190 --> 05:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
isn't interested in fraud prevention and
 
05:50:17.628 --> 05:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
has even obstructed State Auditors from
 
05:50:20.350 --> 05:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
investigating fraud we've learned that
 
05:50:22.628 --> 05:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
at least one EFA vendor has been
 
05:50:25.868 --> 05:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
classified by as a hate group and we've
 
05:50:27.548 --> 05:50:27.558 align:start position:0%
learned that even some
 
05:50:30.468 --> 05:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
proponents of the tax Fair funded EFA
 
05:50:32.910 --> 05:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
program are wincing at the idea of
 
05:50:34.708 --> 05:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
expanding eligibility to families
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
earning more than1 132,000
 
05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
A Year Without at least an annual income
 
05:50:41.440 --> 05:50:43.030 align:start position:0%
A Year Without at least an annual income
recertification

05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
recertification
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm sure you'll hear about
 
05:50:47.868 --> 05:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
how other parts of this report improve
 
05:50:49.868 --> 05:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
the program but it's not enough to
 
05:50:54.070 --> 05:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
overcome all this if you like how wildly
 
05:50:56.910 --> 05:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
successful this taxpayer funded giveaway
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
is now please vote no on the conference
 
05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee report thank
 
05:51:10.030 --> 05:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker this program is
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
working uh I'd like to look at some of
 
05:51:20.030 --> 05:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
the changes which have occurred as a
 
05:51:22.670 --> 05:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
result of our putting the EFA program
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
into work here several years back we are
 
05:51:27.590 --> 05:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
now providing life-changing experiences
 
05:51:30.030 --> 05:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
for many children which had unsuccessful
 
05:51:32.110 --> 05:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
experiences in the rigor education
 
05:51:34.110 --> 05:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
system and that was occurring years
 
05:51:36.270 --> 05:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
before when we had bullying going on uh
 
05:51:37.788 --> 05:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
stud students attending schools for the
 
05:51:39.430 --> 05:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
academic achievement in certain areas
 
05:51:42.110 --> 05:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
was at the bottom of the achievement
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
scale so we have made some compromises
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill dealing with the EFA and
 
05:51:49.670 --> 05:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference had to sit
 
05:51:51.750 --> 05:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
down and we went through three separate
 
05:51:54.110 --> 05:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
we had a break break break come back on
 
05:51:56.350 --> 05:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
three different days to arrive where we
 
05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
are the amendment achieved a compromise
 
05:52:00.468 --> 05:52:00.478 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
05:52:03.110 --> 05:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
Eligibility a family of four the medium
 
05:52:06.910 --> 05:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
family income is now going from 350%
 
05:52:06.920 --> 05:52:08.510 align:start position:0%
family income is now going from 350%
to

05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:11.110 --> 05:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
425 this house had it passed earlier
 
05:52:13.948 --> 05:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
this year 500% if you look at that we've
 
05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
split the difference we're halfway
 
05:52:18.430 --> 05:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
between 350 and
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
500 I'd like to look at some of the
 
05:52:24.788 --> 05:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
folks which are going to be now eligible
 
05:52:27.110 --> 05:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that's important we have a middle
 
05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
class in this state and due to inflation
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
real income not going the way it should
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
be and debt piling up we have some
 
05:52:41.190 --> 05:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
figures I'd like to share with you here
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%

425 we are going to get more kids

60% of students in this state and that
 
05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
is critical and important
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
this adjustment opens the doors to many
 
05:53:41.830 --> 05:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
other middle-income New Hampshire
 
05:53:44.628 --> 05:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
families secondly what this bill
 
05:53:47.708 --> 05:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
does it drops the administrative costs
 
05:53:51.070 --> 05:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
of the EFA program from 10% of the
 
05:53:52.750 --> 05:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
received monies used for administration
 
05:53:56.590 --> 05:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
now to 8% the actual figure is less than
 
05:53:59.948 --> 05:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
8% but I want to make a note that in
 
05:54:02.070 --> 05:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
past when the administrative cost been
 
05:54:04.830 --> 05:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
less than that 10% that money is turned
 
05:54:06.750 --> 05:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
around to use for students who are
 
05:54:09.390 --> 05:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
applying for the EFA program it's used
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
for students not for administration I'm
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
sure the director over there the
 
05:54:15.190 --> 05:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization will do the
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
same thing moving
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
forward we also have a phaseout grants
 
05:54:24.910 --> 05:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
program which is within this bill and
 
05:54:28.110 --> 05:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
it's being extended from 2026 another
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
2029 and lastly I want to touch upon the
 
05:54:36.990 --> 05:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
issue that less than 3% of New Hampshire
 
05:54:39.948 --> 05:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
students participate in the EA program
 
05:54:43.948 --> 05:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
3% of about 164,000 kids were hammering
 
05:54:46.270 --> 05:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
away at those
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
4,875 kids taking advantage of this
 
05:54:51.868 --> 05:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
program there are many programs with
 
05:54:54.468 --> 05:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
students fit best in and this is one
 
05:54:56.270 --> 05:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's not the only program we have
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
Alternative forms of Education we have
 
05:55:00.628 --> 05:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools we have rigor Public
 
05:55:03.310 --> 05:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
Schools I for one when my student was
 
05:55:04.990 --> 05:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
not successful I spoke about earlier
 
05:55:07.468 --> 05:55:07.478 align:start position:0%
today took my student student and
 
05:55:08.990 --> 05:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
enrolled them in the Warren Village
 
05:55:11.230 --> 05:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
School where speech th Services were
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
provided properly so in conclusion the
 
05:55:17.270 --> 05:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
hope of many for a successful 2025
 
05:55:20.430 --> 05:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
school year is a decision that we will
 
05:55:23.548 --> 05:55:23.558 align:start position:0%
make today and I encourage all to press
 
05:55:32.670 --> 05:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:35.070 --> 05:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
much presentive Guthrie has requested a
 
05:55:37.548 --> 05:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
roll calls that's officially
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
05:56:35.670 --> 05:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:35.680 --> 05:56:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
clear

05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:43.468 --> 05:56:43.478 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to adopt the
 
05:56:46.110 --> 05:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
committee of conference report in 1665
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote chair
 
05:56:49.750 --> 05:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Miler for a
 
05:56:49.760 --> 05:56:56.948 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Miler for a
parliamentary

05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:59.468 --> 05:56:59.478 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:57:01.990 --> 05:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the education
 
05:57:05.590 --> 05:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program was initiated
 
05:57:09.948 --> 05:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
and AD dedicated as a poverty program to
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
assist families earning less than 350%
 
05:57:15.750 --> 05:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the poverty level and that the
 
05:57:17.628 --> 05:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
current proposed
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
changes basically change the intent of
 
05:57:24.590 --> 05:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
the program by increasing the level to
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
425 for a family earning
 
05:57:30.788 --> 05:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
$133,000 a
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
year if I know that unlike other state
 
05:57:36.948 --> 05:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
budgeted programs
 
05:57:40.948 --> 05:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
the EFA is has little accountability and
 
05:57:46.270 --> 05:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
oversight for a $0 million program with
 
05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
the majority of the house rejecting any
 
05:57:52.788 --> 05:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
attempt to provide appropriate guard
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
rails on the management of the
 
05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
program if I know that of the 160,000
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
public school students only
 
05:58:06.708 --> 05:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
5% have left the public schools and that
 
05:58:09.750 --> 05:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
the majority of the EFA funds are being
 
05:58:12.270 --> 05:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
directed to students who are currently
 
05:58:14.948 --> 05:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
in private or religious
 
05:58:18.270 --> 05:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
schools if I know that the origin of the
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
EFA program was initiated without a
 
05:58:25.030 --> 05:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
proper public hearing and that the
 
05:58:28.750 --> 05:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
public interest surveys object to having
 
05:58:31.910 --> 05:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
public tax dollars paying for Religious
 
05:58:35.350 --> 05:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
Education and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
05:58:38.030 --> 05:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the EFA Advocates
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately want this program to
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
eventually become a universal program
 
05:58:45.708 --> 05:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
available to All Families regardless of
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
their income level to access public tax
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollars and further drain needed tax
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
dollars away from the overwhelmingly
 
05:58:57.948 --> 05:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
publicly supported public education
 
05:59:01.468 --> 05:59:01.478 align:start position:0%
would I now reject House Bill
 
05:59:04.628 --> 05:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
1665 and stop the expansion of the EFA
 
05:59:08.468 --> 05:59:08.478 align:start position:0%
voucher program to the for 125% level by
 
05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button thank you Mr

05:59:23.788 --> 05:59:23.798 align:start position:0%

05:59:26.150 --> 05:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
would welcome your support for Universal

05:59:27.670 --> 05:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
05:59:29.750 --> 05:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
program and if I know this bill
 
05:59:31.070 --> 05:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
increases the household income
 
05:59:32.830 --> 05:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility cap for Education Freedom
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
accounts from 350 to 425 of the federal
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines which is close to
 
05:59:41.150 --> 05:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
medium income in the state if I believe
 
05:59:43.230 --> 05:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
the by expanding the eligibility level
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
offers a lifechanging increase for many
 
05:59:47.910 --> 05:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
middle-income New Hampshire families who
 
05:59:50.110 --> 05:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
are drowning and trapped under high
 
05:59:53.230 --> 05:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
inflationary expenses and debt if I
 
05:59:54.590 --> 05:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
further know that there are many
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
families seeking the right educational
 
05:59:59.070 --> 05:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
fit who will realize hope through this
 
06:00:02.548 --> 06:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
educational option and lastly would I
 
06:00:04.670 --> 06:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
then support middle-income children and
 
06:00:06.590 --> 06:00:06.600 align:start position:0%

onethird of those of us who are in the

06:12:09.548 --> 06:12:09.558 align:start position:0%
next term that's the usual
 
06:12:12.310 --> 06:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
turnover whether it's more or less I
 
06:12:15.948 --> 06:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
don't know some of those who will leave
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
are people who have been our colleagues
 
06:12:21.548 --> 06:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
and who we have worked with some of
 
06:12:23.628 --> 06:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
those who will leave have become our
 
06:12:27.948 --> 06:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
closest friends and we will very much
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
miss them but perhaps actually get to
 
06:12:32.750 --> 06:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
see them in another
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%

never asked for unanimous consent before
 
06:12:46.868 --> 06:12:46.878 align:start position:0%

06:12:49.920 --> 06:12:52.230 align:start position:0%

unbelievably difficult

States wet knew that there was a problem
 
06:15:53.468 --> 06:15:53.478 align:start position:0%
and he worked unbelievably hard to make
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
sure that the United States played the
 
06:16:01.670 --> 06:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
role that it should play in terms of
 
06:16:01.680 --> 06:16:03.190 align:start position:0%

06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
always held
 
06:16:14.910 --> 06:16:14.920 align:start position:0%

Sheriff's life I don't agree with Steve

anybody who I've agreed with on
 
06:16:30.590 --> 06:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
everything but Steve stands out as
 
06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
someone who recognized that there is n
 
06:16:38.310 --> 06:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
no such thing as people on one side of
 
06:16:41.070 --> 06:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
the aisle or the other that there's no
 
06:16:44.030 --> 06:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
such thing as people who deserve to be
 
06:16:46.868 --> 06:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
respected as against those who do not
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
deserve to be respected Steve provided a
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%

term after that forever in the future we
 
06:17:05.670 --> 06:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
will do very well
 
06:17:09.590 --> 06:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
in this body to preserve the core values
 
06:17:13.430 --> 06:17:13.440 align:start position:0%

reference but anyways Lou gar anyways so
 
06:25:50.990 --> 06:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
anyways I I I've lived my childhood
 
06:25:54.070 --> 06:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
dream my entire life since I was in
 
06:25:57.030 --> 06:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
fourth grade I stood up for somebody who
 
06:25:59.590 --> 06:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
was being abused by other people and I
 
06:26:02.070 --> 06:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
found that like so empowering that I
 
06:26:03.948 --> 06:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
wanted that to be the what I did the
 
06:26:07.230 --> 06:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
rest of my life and in doing so I was
 
06:26:10.548 --> 06:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
living up to my mom my mom was disabled
 
06:26:14.030 --> 06:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
but somehow she was a real life Good
 
06:26:16.350 --> 06:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
Samaritan who always put the needs of
 
06:26:18.310 --> 06:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
everybody else above her own and I
 
06:26:20.390 --> 06:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
always wanted to be like
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
her un like my mom though I'm able and
 
06:26:25.510 --> 06:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'm able to travel the world and do all
 
06:26:26.990 --> 06:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
sorts of things and I've been able to
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
meet all sorts of amazing wonderful
 
06:26:32.230 --> 06:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
people and in one of my travels when I
 
06:26:34.390 --> 06:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
was uh I met this gentleman named John
 
06:26:39.110 --> 06:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
Bell who you have not met um John um I
 
06:26:41.590 --> 06:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
met in a strange way he was sitting
 
06:26:44.230 --> 06:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
right there when I gave my book launch
 
06:26:46.590 --> 06:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
at the center for practical bioethics in
 
06:26:49.070 --> 06:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
Kansas City that's a talk for another
 
06:26:50.788 --> 06:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
day what the center does but they do
 
06:26:54.110 --> 06:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
amazing bioethical work and I've been am
 
06:26:55.670 --> 06:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
really lucky to been part of them for
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years and when I did my book
 
06:27:00.468 --> 06:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
launch that's the only place that I
 
06:27:04.270 --> 06:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it so um when I got there
 
06:27:05.788 --> 06:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
you don't need to know what my book is
 
06:27:08.548 --> 06:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
about but what I did do was look at a
 
06:27:10.670 --> 06:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
complex social problem that of how
 
06:27:13.390 --> 06:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
poorly we manage pain and I looked at
 
06:27:15.150 --> 06:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
all the different institutions in our
 
06:27:17.270 --> 06:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
culture that deal with that and using
 
06:27:19.390 --> 06:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
the Good Samaritan as my guide what do
 
06:27:21.110 --> 06:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
you say you're going to do for people in
 
06:27:23.788 --> 06:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
need what do you actually do what's the
 
06:27:26.230 --> 06:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
gap between and how do we bridge that
 
06:27:29.070 --> 06:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
through creative public policy in the
 
06:27:30.830 --> 06:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
middle of that I develop what I call the
 
06:27:33.190 --> 06:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
hypocrite scale if you do what you say
 
06:27:35.150 --> 06:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to do and you help that
 
06:27:37.270 --> 06:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
person in need you're a hero maybe even
 
06:27:40.628 --> 06:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
a saint if you don't do it then you're a
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
hypocrite and if you turn around and
 
06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
actually abuse the person in need you're
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
a coward and when I present my book talk
 
06:27:50.708 --> 06:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
I say usually I'm kind of in the
 
06:27:54.110 --> 06:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
hypocrite range on that scale and so as
 
06:27:56.030 --> 06:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm giving my talk there's this guy in
 
06:27:57.548 --> 06:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
the front row and I'm you know I don't
 
06:27:59.230 --> 06:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
know about how when you guys give talks
 
06:28:01.750 --> 06:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
but I always seem to focus on one person
 
06:28:04.310 --> 06:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
and I focused on John and I think the
 
06:28:05.948 --> 06:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
reason why was cuz he looked like he
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't listening to a word I was saying
 
06:28:11.270 --> 06:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
and and it didn't like I was like really
 
06:28:12.948 --> 06:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know getting in or anything like
 
06:28:15.270 --> 06:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
that and then finally you know the talk
 
06:28:18.150 --> 06:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
comes to an end and we do discussion and
 
06:28:20.548 --> 06:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
so the first person to stand up was John
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
and I found out that John always looks
 
06:28:25.510 --> 06:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
that way and that he heard everything I
 
06:28:27.548 --> 06:28:27.558 align:start position:0%
said he'd actually even read my book and
 
06:28:32.110 --> 06:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
he wanted to share a story so John um is
 
06:28:34.230 --> 06:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
africanamerican um he's lived with pain
 
06:28:37.270 --> 06:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
his whole life he has sickle cell anemia
 
06:28:40.270 --> 06:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
um sickle cell disease creates periods
 
06:28:42.070 --> 06:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
of what we call crisis where you can get
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
anywhere from moderate to severe
 
06:28:47.150 --> 06:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
pain when your Pain's really bad you go
 
06:28:49.468 --> 06:28:49.478 align:start position:0%
to the ER and that's what John did one
 
06:28:51.230 --> 06:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
day and when he went there he was so
 
06:28:53.948 --> 06:28:53.958 align:start position:0%
disenchanted with how the people treated
 
06:28:56.390 --> 06:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
him like he wasn't worthy like his
 
06:28:58.468 --> 06:28:58.478 align:start position:0%
self-esteem his Integrity wasn't worthy
 
06:29:00.990 --> 06:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
of the guy's effort so needless to say
 
06:29:02.990 --> 06:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
that really didn't sit very well one
 
06:29:04.868 --> 06:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
thing I didn't tell you is John works
 
06:29:06.788 --> 06:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
for the center as a citizen Advocate
 
06:29:08.708 --> 06:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
meaning he advocates for the rights of
 
06:29:11.430 --> 06:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
people who are disabled on his own time
 
06:29:14.628 --> 06:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
no pay nothing so three weeks later
 
06:29:16.868 --> 06:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
John's back at the hospital advocating
 
06:29:19.070 --> 06:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
for somebody and he gets on the elevator
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
to go up to the third floor and he
 
06:29:22.948 --> 06:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
pushes the button you know how the doors
 
06:29:25.030 --> 06:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
are shut and an arm comes right through
 
06:29:27.310 --> 06:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
like that well an arm came through and
 
06:29:29.468 --> 06:29:29.478 align:start position:0%
John said that was the doctor that
 
06:29:31.948 --> 06:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
treated me in the emergency room and the
 
06:29:34.468 --> 06:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
minute the doctor looked at him he kind
 
06:29:36.628 --> 06:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
of got like a look like of
 
06:29:39.390 --> 06:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
recognition and John looked at him and
 
06:29:41.750 --> 06:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
think about you have that opportunity
 
06:29:44.990 --> 06:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is a Gibbs NCIS elevator moment
 
06:29:48.190 --> 06:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
what would you say to him and I you know
 
06:29:50.750 --> 06:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
when John then said he goes to me this
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
was a teaching moment and I looked at
 
06:29:56.270 --> 06:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
him and I said do you know who I am and
 
06:29:59.788 --> 06:29:59.798 align:start position:0%
the doctor said yes and he goes listen
 
06:30:03.150 --> 06:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
he goes when I need you there for me I
 
06:30:04.910 --> 06:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
need you to be there but I don't need
 
06:30:07.070 --> 06:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
you right now but I when I need you I
 
06:30:09.430 --> 06:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
need you to be there so then I asked
 
06:30:11.468 --> 06:30:11.478 align:start position:0%
John why did you do that why didn't you
 
06:30:13.030 --> 06:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
just give him a piece of your mind
 
06:30:14.390 --> 06:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people would have done
 
06:30:16.510 --> 06:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
that and John
 
06:30:18.948 --> 06:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
said if I had done that I would have
 
06:30:21.628 --> 06:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
lost an opportunity to teach this doctor
 
06:30:24.070 --> 06:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
that he made a mistake and that's how he
 
06:30:25.468 --> 06:30:25.478 align:start position:0%
should treat other
 
06:30:29.110 --> 06:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
people so you know last I checked I'm
 
06:30:30.868 --> 06:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
white he's black there's certain things
 
06:30:32.830 --> 06:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
you don't say on your first meeting and
 
06:30:34.708 --> 06:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
I was not comfortable John and I got to
 
06:30:37.110 --> 06:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
be really good friends and a couple
 
06:30:38.830 --> 06:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
years later I finally asked him the
 
06:30:40.590 --> 06:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
question I really wanted to ask on the
 
06:30:42.270 --> 06:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
day one he says do you think they
 
06:30:44.708 --> 06:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
treated you that way because you're
 
06:30:48.230 --> 06:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
black and and I we know that black males
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
especially are are stigmatized in the
 
06:30:52.350 --> 06:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
Health Care system did they treat you
 
06:30:54.030 --> 06:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
that way because you were in pain
 
06:30:55.948 --> 06:30:55.958 align:start position:0%
because we know people in pain are
 
06:30:58.628 --> 06:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
stigmatized and he didn't even hesitate
 
06:31:01.708 --> 06:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
to answer he goes no the answer is fear
 
06:31:04.190 --> 06:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I said you know I this is my
 
06:31:07.708 --> 06:31:07.718 align:start position:0%
Freudian Jim Freudian instead of an I
 
06:31:10.868 --> 06:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
just said fear he goes yeah fear of the
 
06:31:14.548 --> 06:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
ramifications of doing the right thing
 
06:31:16.430 --> 06:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
and immediately when he said that I knew
 
06:31:17.990 --> 06:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
what he was talking about I don't know
 
06:31:19.510 --> 06:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
how many times I've stood up for
 
06:31:22.110 --> 06:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
somebody and had to you know get take a
 
06:31:23.910 --> 06:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
lot of grief for doing it every time I
 
06:31:25.868 --> 06:31:25.878 align:start position:0%
write an opioid prescription half the
 
06:31:27.548 --> 06:31:27.558 align:start position:0%
planet wants to tell me I'm doing the
 
06:31:29.948 --> 06:31:29.958 align:start position:0%
wrong thing and so I knew what he was
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
talking about but then that brought me
 
06:31:34.868 --> 06:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
to hear I was not doing doing well not
 
06:31:37.510 --> 06:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
long ago I was like wondering why am I
 
06:31:39.830 --> 06:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
here what am I doing I'm making
 
06:31:42.030 --> 06:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
decisions pushing buttons that I don't
 
06:31:44.628 --> 06:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
agree with and the whole time I'm
 
06:31:48.350 --> 06:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
thinking well what would John say and so
 
06:31:49.948 --> 06:31:49.958 align:start position:0%
then you
 
06:31:52.830 --> 06:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
know I talked to a whole bunch of people
 
06:31:54.750 --> 06:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
here and everybody said the three things
 
06:31:56.430 --> 06:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
that are most important when you make a
 
06:31:56.440 --> 06:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
that are most important when you make a
decision

06:31:57.750 --> 06:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
decision
 
06:31:57.760 --> 06:31:59.310 align:start position:0%
decision
are

06:31:59.310 --> 06:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:32:02.628 --> 06:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
conscience constituents and party in
 
06:32:04.868 --> 06:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
that order and and then I looked at one
 
06:32:06.750 --> 06:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
person I said if that's the case then
 
06:32:10.350 --> 06:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
why aren't I doing that and so I decided
 
06:32:12.750 --> 06:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
I needed to go back to Kansas City to
 
06:32:15.350 --> 06:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
find home and I get back there there was
 
06:32:17.150 --> 06:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
a dinner and I go to the dinner and I
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
see my friend Cindy and I go how's John
 
06:32:23.670 --> 06:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
and she said John's gone he died three
 
06:32:25.750 --> 06:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
months before and he was
 
06:32:27.910 --> 06:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
gone and I'm
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
like not sure what to say
 
06:32:34.468 --> 06:32:34.478 align:start position:0%
so in 4 minutes I went went through kuer
 
06:32:36.548 --> 06:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
Ross's five stages of grieving and came
 
06:32:39.628 --> 06:32:39.638 align:start position:0%
to equilibrium and I finally realized
 
06:32:42.350 --> 06:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
John the Gospel of John the word became
 
06:32:45.310 --> 06:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
flesh and he lived Among Us and I
 
06:32:49.468 --> 06:32:49.478 align:start position:0%
realize that we live on not in who we
 
06:32:52.510 --> 06:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
are now but in what we do in word and
 
06:32:54.990 --> 06:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
deed and that was the message that I
 
06:32:57.788 --> 06:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
took home and when I came back here all
 
06:32:59.350 --> 06:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
the sudden it was like somebody took a
 
06:33:01.310 --> 06:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
yoke off my shoulders and all of the
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
sudden I was willing to say what I felt
 
06:33:05.070 --> 06:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
I needed to say push the buttons that I
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
felt that I needed to put push and it
 
06:33:10.430 --> 06:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
was the best day in my life and so what
 
06:33:12.388 --> 06:33:12.398 align:start position:0%
I hope for you is that John can be an
 
06:33:16.350 --> 06:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
inspiration to you and also if you pray
 
06:33:18.150 --> 06:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
could you please say a prayer for him so
 
06:33:19.990 --> 06:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
that he finds his home where where I
 
06:33:23.980 --> 06:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
hope we all find our home someday thank
 
06:33:23.990 --> 06:33:31.510 align:start position:0%
hope we all find our home someday thank

that you must recognize that you are not

about our unique life challenges

other marginalized communities by
 
06:36:27.468 --> 06:36:27.478 align:start position:0%
substituting terms like gay with

disabled or transgender with immigrant
 
06:36:31.990 --> 06:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
