avard how you doing morning everybody
 
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
the floor is
 
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
yours for the record on Senator Kevin
 
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
aard I represent District
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
12 and I am the prime sponsor of this
 
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill and this bill basically is uh the
 
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
Genesis of uh of this bill basically
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
came out of of a previous study that we
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
had in uh last summer and it had to do
 
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
landfills and what we discovered with
 
00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
the information with the landfills is
 
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
that you know there's there's water
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
issues there's potential water issues
 
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
around the state whether it's past uh
 
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh Rising Tides uh number
 
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
of issues that are are affecting our
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
water system so you know I brought up in
 
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
in the committee I said hey so what do
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
we thought what do we think about having
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
a plan B maybe something to have in case
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
there is a natural disaster
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
or there's some nefarious acts that is
 
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
that are going on and that contaminates
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
our wells um I don't think I have to
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
tell you that we have issues with Waters
 
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
around around the state whether it's up
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
north there's arsenic there's pasas
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
marac and a number of different areas so
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh we just thought about maybe uh
 
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
introducing uh a
 
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
study a study just to look at the the
 
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
possibilities of a desalinization plant
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
around the Sea Coast and it it doesn't
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a desalinization
 
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
plan it could be an osmosis plan or
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
something around the state so we have an
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
alternative resource in case something
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
bad happens and so it's just a study I
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
would recommend I I noticed that uh it
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
says three Senators I would ask that we
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
just change it to one member of the
 
00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 align:start position:0%
Senate if that's okay just
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
to make it if if you can make that a
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment but um that's really
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
the yes of of this you know we uh we
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
definitely need uh to look at I think
 
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
other resources and I think California
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
is just starting to look at it so uh
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
study willing to take any questions each
 
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
might have okay all right just this the
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill says two members of the Senate oh
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know what my copy on this is as
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
amended right i' still ask you know one
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
would be great I think one I'm I'm I'm
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
cons happy with one if you'll give me
 
00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
me I would hope so yeah and and and I
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
like to when I do have a study I do like
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
to generate something that's useful um I
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
don't even necessarily have to agree but
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
at least we get the conversation going
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's that's the wonderful
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
thing about what happened here we had uh
 
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
pretty much a a controversial uh topic
 
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
with the landfills I I think you can all
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
agree with that and out of it we we
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
learned some things that uh we could all
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
come to the table with and look at each
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
other in the eye and say you know we did
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
a good job researching what what we had
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the things that I I
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
just considered kind of thinking outside
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
the box do we need one now probably not
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
will we need one in the future who knows
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
but we can we can look into that so I I
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
like to generate useful and practical
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
information uh when it comes to it
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
study thank you is there any questions
 
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
by members of the committee
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question we
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
received a letter from commissioner
 
00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
Scott at Dees and he mentioned that
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's an ongoing commission looking at
 
00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
long-term needs at the Sea Coast um do
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
you think it might be helpful to get
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
their report before we implement this
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
study committee uh not necessarily I
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
think again one of the neat things about
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
having a study is that you can uh we can
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
do our own research yes there's a lot of
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
work that's going on that was brought up
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
in testimony and they came and they
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
talked about that I don't want to
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
interrupt what they're doing uh but at
 
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
the same time um I like to hit the
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
ground running and if I can glean things
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
and if if a desalinization plant uh was
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
something that they they kind of ruled
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
out we can always look at osmosis or we
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
can look at other other forms where we
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
can uh uh have at the ready um uh for
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislation for the next session if
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to take the the rein
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
on that but um you know I I don't want
 
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
to be looking oh we should have done
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
something you know this is more again
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's a conversation that's one of the
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
things about that's beautiful about a
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
study and it brings both sides together
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
you know I like I like a little bit of
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan thing going on here so that's
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
uh that um we won't interrupt their work
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes there's something that's going on
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
that's great and there's all forms of uh
 
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh of individuals that are engaged in
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
this conversation I just want I want us
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
to be engaged with it as well oh okay
 
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
just a followup Mr follow okay so did
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
you have any conversations with people
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
at Dees prior to they came and testify
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
yes oh okay yeah okay all right thank
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
you very much absolutely representative
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
Donnelly thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh have you had
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
any inspiration from other um I'll say
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
either countries or some of the islands
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
that have done desalinization um have
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
you had any are there other outside of
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
the United States opportunities for you
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
to be looking at this to see what your
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
um inspiration is on this particular
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
study well what's kind of cool I'm just
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
sitting in the in the hall waiting to
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
come in here and I'm talking to one of
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists who happened to uh uh know
 
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
about a particular thing that's
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
happening in Saudi Arabia and theyve
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
been doing this for years and of course
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
we know that if you've been to Aruba
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
they have that and lo and behold Star
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
Island I don't know if you know where
 
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
the uh uh Star Island is here in New
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the ISA schs they have a
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
little one uh but which is kind of cool
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh and I know that uh California hasn't
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
really done it now they're starting to
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
look at it or they're starting to do it
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like to see what they have to
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
do with Saudi Arabia obviously Israel
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
they a lot of the areas South Africa
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
they've done it where water is precious
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's actually more precious than gold so
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take for granted that we
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
are we have you know the Lakes Region we
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
have all these aquifers that are around
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
but something happens um not trying to
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
be paranoid but you know we discover
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
about a leak Cobain you know uh the
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
landfills and
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to be caught
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
flat-footed you know so looking at all
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
those other other states would be
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
wonderful to to look at them and bring
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
in you know what they have to what they
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
have to offer what we can consider for
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and like I said it doesn't
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
have to necessarily be
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
desalinization but that's that's the
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
springboard what we're going to stop
 
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.069 align:start position:0%
springboard what we're going to stop
start

00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
with okay representative ghou
 
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.670 align:start position:0%
with okay representative ghou
representative

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
Simpson representative gold actually she
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh touched upon the uh the issue I had
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
but of the countries Israel and the
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
other countries doing it yeah I think
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to consider what other
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
other other have done uh again we have
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
our own departments looking into this uh
 
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
but let's you know if if we need to put
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
some legislation into uh to encourage uh
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
something in the future who knows what
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
you know what can happen in the next six
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
months or or two years whatever um we'll
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
be ready okay just remember folks you
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned all these islands no trips no
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
field trips to aru like that
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative simps I don't mind if you
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
put it into the language I will
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
definitely endorse it
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
budget representative Simpson thank you
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative um I was looking
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
at the membership the potential
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
membership of the committee and um
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if you've talked to any
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
members of the senate or the house who
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
are in the Sea Coast region especially
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
that have Coastline um because I'm
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
thinking some of the big issues would
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
likely be like placement and how to deal
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
with byproducts and all of that sort of
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
thing there brackish water was an issue
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
that Senator alsa did bring up she is on
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast uh again we you know
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
the initial part was the Sea Coast but
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
it could be anywhere around the state
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's osmosis or anywhere it it
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to be at the
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast like I said it's just a
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
springboard uh but um yes uh I she was
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
she was concerned because of the
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
Department's already doing a lot of work
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
on this and that's fine I think I think
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
it's great but I think again if
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
you get a a number of independent Minds
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
in a room talking uh about this
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
particular topic could be osmosis it
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
could be something else we can glean
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
from other areas we can bring it to the
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
Departments they can say yes this works
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't work and uh go from there I
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
know our submarines have
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
uh uh desalinization in them so it's
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.110 align:start position:0%
kind of
cool

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
cool
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Veil
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you senator
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
for coming in and presenting today I
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
just have one question about okay so
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's I'm on line 10 the possibility of
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
putting a desalination plan in New
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including an assessment of
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
cost and benefits um so I'm looking at
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
this um the scope of what is there and
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
it's not very specific and what I would
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
be looking to have considered would be
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
economic impacts and environmental
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
impacts we can tease that out in the
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
study for sure absolutely thank you for
 
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.710 align:start position:0%
study for sure absolutely thank you for
the

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
question representative rung for uh wait
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
minut excuse me representative Darby for
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
the first time then representative BR
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm also from nasua
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
um I understand you represent more than
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
nashaa but I you've talked a couple of
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
times about osmosis plants um as option
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
but the the study the the language in
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically says desalination
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
so if you're if you're thinking about
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
this as um as used in other areas of the
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
state other than the Sea Coast should
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill be broader than
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
just desalination I'm open to that okay
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
thank you you know in NASA years ago
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
when I was a kid um Liv on 14 Harbor
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
Avenue and uh which is about like half a
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
mile maybe a quarter a mile from the
 
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.110 align:start position:0%
mile maybe a quarter a mile from the
marac

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
marac
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
River and I loved fish and the Nashville
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
River emptied into the marac
 
00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
river and uh I I I used to see some
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
things coming out of the sewers going
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
right into the uh and I still like the
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
fish so whatever I saw was not pleasant
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pipes into the miramac
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
and clean water uh you I still wouldn't
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
eat a fish from there as as much
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
progress as we had made just just
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
because of what I've seen but we've come
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
a long way if you will but uh you know
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
that that's always been in the back of
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
my mind and then you hear uh whether
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
there's arsenic there's well poisoning
 
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
from from uh U landfills or there's uh
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
Industrial Waste and just got to
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
thinking you know may maybe we should
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
start thinking about something that uh
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
could be a plan B thinking kind of
 
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
outside the box so that's but um I'm
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
willing I'm open to uh you know if you
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
want to augment it to any you you know
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
other fors very happy to do
 
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.949 align:start position:0%
other fors very happy to do
so

00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
again senator for taking my question in
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
response to representative Donley's
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
question and and also representative
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
Darby you mentioned that you're open to
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment um at noon today the EPA is is
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
having a press conference in marac
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
announcing the establishment of mcl's
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
for six past molecules and I was having
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
a discussion with colleagues about the
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
impact this is going to have on local
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water Systems and the need for
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
them to uh construct gak filters
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
granulated activated carbon to remove
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
past because the the the the limits are
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
very low um so would you be open to
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
having this bill be amended to not just
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
look at desalination but also any water
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
treatment to enable Municipal Water
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
Regulation well there you go you're
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
thinking outside the box okay and that's
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
kind of the thing that we'll do in the
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
study but yes I'd be absolutely and and
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
those are some of the things that I love
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
about a study that we can we can
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
consider stuff like that I think that's
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
a great idea okay just one quick
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
followup um you mentioned osmosis and
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
desalination as a disclaimer I used to
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
have a business called filmtech in my
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
business portfolio when I worked for a
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
large corporation and they're the world
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
leader in desalination as far as I know
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's always reverse osmosis and
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
nanofiltration so um I'd be curious to
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
see if there's other ways of
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
desalinating on a commercial scale that
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
would have other technology but if you
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
ever go out to film Tech they're in a
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and it was always a great trip
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
for me cuz it was just like three blocks
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
from the Mall of
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
America so but you know
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
we can talk offline too if you want to
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
talk more about that kind of technology
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
and I think what you're seeing right now
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
just even in our conversation is is the
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
give and take of of ideas and and what
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
the study can do and uh if nothing else
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
we can we can bring to the awareness
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
around the state uh the need uh for
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
clean water and for situations where you
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
know we we we got to take a little pay a
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
little more attention to it
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
so representative wolf for a question is
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
there enough time thank you for taking
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
my question absolutely is there enough
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
time with all of these ideas to do the
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
study and complete it I'm really good at
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
studies okay you got to realize folks
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
anything yeah okay yeah and we'll have
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations and and and whatnot and
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh um I I like to pick brains and I like
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
to see what uh what things we can come
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
up with and it's useful great if we we
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
find that we can't do anything that's
 
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.230 align:start position:0%
find that we can't do anything that's
also

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
useful Harvey Bo and then representative
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
par okay real quick thank you very much
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing up this uh
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
legislation Senator avart and I was just
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if it would be accurate to say
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
that maybe um two two things if if the
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
chair will indulge me if this
 
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.070 align:start position:0%
chair will indulge me if this
legislation

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
is more like a let's see how we can
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
improve improve Municipal Water
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
Supply um since it probably doesn't
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
pertain to all the people on Wells up
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
north um because I don't assume that a
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
desalinization plant at the coast would
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
be piping up to Points North and second
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
part if you don't mind um do you know of
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
any uh reverse osmosis that's already
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
going on in Municipal Water Supply
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
plants thanks uh locally no I do not
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
know if there are any and I'd like to
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
enter main that if if that's a
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
possibility I do know that as far as
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
distribution that is definitely uh
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
something that the Departments did come
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
up and say you know that that there is
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
an issue with that so uh like I said it
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know we this is a springboard and
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
and we can we can entertain thoughts of
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know if we needed that extra
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
water supply uh how would uh we go about
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
Distributing it and
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
whatnot so you know getting back to the
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
landfill it
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
we we were just trying to figure out how
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
we can reduce the landfill now I know
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about osmosis and then you
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
know we were talking about you know how
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
it water just kept coming up over and
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again uh with the
 
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.549 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again uh with the
landfill

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
build and uh we realize that we can
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
actually reduce the tonnage by 2third if
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
we incinerate like like Massachusetts
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
does uh Western Massachusetts
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
incinerates a lot and with that
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
incineration they also uh Power they use
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
it for for energy an energy resource and
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
they power their water treatment
 
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
plant that's kind of cool uh it's
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shopping
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
now you know now you got to weigh the
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
balance well if we incinerate there's
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
air pollution if we put it in the ground
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
there's contamination of water but you
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
know we got scrubbers we got technology
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
if we desalinized we there's this
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
brackish system situations but I'm not
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
taking no for an answer as far as you
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
know can we come up with something
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
that'll work for New Hampshire you know
 
00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:07.870 align:start position:0%
that'll work for New Hampshire you know
so

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
um uh I I don't know of anything locally
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
that's doing it there might be again we
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
can tease that out in the study okay
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative harb then rep representa
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
Ryan and I want to say one thing uh
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
we've had a week or so off but more than
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
half the committee has asked a question
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
so uh you know cool it
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
down I like you
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't representative harb representative
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh my question is this why did you pick
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
a committee over a commission where I've
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
sat on some commissions and then you can
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
have other stakeholders involved not
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
that I'm against members of the house
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
and the Senate but if this is such an
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
um why didn't you move for a commission
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
and then put a number of stakeholders on
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
just a question thank thank you for that
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
question but as
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
as as a legislator I I I know
 
00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.029 align:start position:0%
as as a legislator I I I know
commissions

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
work and commissions can continue and
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
continue and continue a study we can at
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
least my experience in every study that
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
I've done and I'll I'll have a couple
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
more coming up on energy uh um this year
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
I got a small time frame I can make
 
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
suggestions and if we want to build a
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
commission from that point on that's
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
great but it's it's like I said it's a
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
spring board
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't mean to be
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
insulting at all but um the department
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
of bureaucracy can work very slowly at
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
times and I I think uh just from my
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
experience uh handling something like
 
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.870 align:start position:0%
experience uh handling something like
this

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I have a track record of being
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
being able to produce something that's
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
useful and uh for everybody and so
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know I guess some of that
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
lays on me um but I I um I guess I would
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
have to ask you to trust me to move move
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
the conversation and if if it turns out
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
that we need a commission or we can
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
augment an already existing commission
 
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
white if the state ends up in a major
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
emergency or disaster as you say which
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
is what we're we're preparing for don't
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
you think the federal government would
 
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.430 align:start position:0%
you think the federal government would
be

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
involved and probably would supersede
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
either way uh they could uh but we've
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
had a train Rick out in the Midwest and
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
that that water situation hasn't really
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh been resolved yet
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
any any other uh questions by members of
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none you very much
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you all I really appreciate your
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
deers

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.630 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
morning for the record my name is Ted
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
deers and I'm the assistant director of
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
The Water Division at the New Hampshire
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh you received a letter this morning in
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
your email but I printed out a copy for
 
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
you to have here at the hearing and
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
mostly I just want to spend a couple of
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
minutes uh maybe addressing some of the
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions that already came up to the
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
senator and just to brag a little bit on
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
stuff we're already doing um along these
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
lines just so that you have some
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
awareness of that so if you'll indulge
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
me for just a couple of minutes um the
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of desalinization really
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't been looked at in depth since the
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
N since the early 2000s there was a
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
study uh looking at uh something in
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
Seabrook sort of coordinated with the uh
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plant to see if there was
 
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
a way to make that economical at that
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
point it was not um so so this hasn't
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
been looked at I would say in depth for
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
for uh some significant period of time
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
time the work that we're primarily
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
engaged in at this point around the
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
state relative to you know sort of water
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
supply and kind of the emergency
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
situation that uh representa or that
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
Senator avard was talking about and
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
again his take on this is a little
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
different from I think the current work
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
that's going on which is really looking
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
towards the current needs um and and
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
also of course some of the issues that
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
have been raised by some of the future
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
needs regulatory you know and otherwise
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
um is that we've really been focused on
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
interconnection uh one of the big
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
studies that we did in the southern part
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
of the state identified that uh we have
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
plenty of water it just isn't where we
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
kind of need it and so the idea is
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
really to look at uh the distribution um
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
how you interact with the distribution
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
of different kinds of treatment types of
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
where the water goes and how it's needed
 
00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:27.559 align:start position:0%
and where it's going to be needed in the
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
future and so those have been the
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
primary focus and you've seen some of
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
those bills and there's bills that you
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know there are probably still on on
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
the docket yet to for you to see you
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
know things related to say the the water
 
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
pipe underneath the miramac down in
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
Lichfield or Hudson and you know some of
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
these things that you've already seen
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
come across uh your your desks so and
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
the same is true going on right now in
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
the C Coast we have a study that will be
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
done sort of later in 2024 early 2025
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
which which does do exactly the same
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
thing which looks at what's current
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
water supply capacity what are the W
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
water demands you know what is actually
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
being used um doing some design
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
Alternatives analysis of different ways
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
of doing interconnection and water
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
supply understanding the the situation
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
which is I think achieving almost Epic
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
Proportions uh among small water
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
suppliers so these small water supply
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
systems are becoming increasingly
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
non-economic to run understanding how we
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
try to connect some of those and get
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
Consolidated and really looking at
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
Regional cooperation of where there's
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
water and how that moves around in a
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
different area looking at the funding
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
what would it cost to do some of these
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
things what would a cost to supply some
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
of these and you know understanding um
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
you know with some techn having some
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
some technical memos uh so that you can
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what would be needed
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
and some of the sort of conceptual plans
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
for how it could be
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
provided that's a little different than
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
I think what Senator avard is looking at
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is sort of coming up with sort of
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
this planb approach but it is fit within
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
the information that you would need to
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
understand in terms of what is the need
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
where is the need how is it currently
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
supplied and what does it cost to do the
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that we're already doing
 
00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:23.519 align:start position:0%
or need to do that is already being
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
looked at and will be available sometime
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
after this commission uh would or the
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
committee uh would finish its work the
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
only other thing that I would want to
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
point out is that um we there somebody
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
asked the question about whether or not
 
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
there's any uh reverse osmosis going on
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
in any municipalities I would just note
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
and it was also brought up about
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
landfills is the turnkey uh landfill in
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester does actually have an RO plant
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
a reverse osmosis plant that it sends
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
its lead shap through and that was
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
really because of the recalcitrant
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
nature of nitrogen within their effluent
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
so basically they leachates weird stuff
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and it's not well treated in current
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not well treated
 
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
depending the constituency of it in
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
modern wastewater treatment plants and
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
so Rochester was a have a bit of a hard
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
time with that product so they put on
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
two reverse osmosis I think there's
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
something like half a million gallons a
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
day that they're actually treating um as
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
part of their as part of their permits
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
so as a as a for those of you who
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
followed the trials and tribulations of
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
Great Bay um it uh was a huge Boon to
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
reducing nitrogen coming out of the
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
kacho river um as as a result of the
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
that that Improvement and was a major
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
Improvement for the entire
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
Estuary I have no other thing else to
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
say except that if you have any
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
like is an a
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
veil thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
deers so I'm just looking at the
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
situation where we were talking about um
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the landfill and
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
incineration and water quality and my
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if it goes up in
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
the air it can wind up in the water is
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
that the case well certainly what goes
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
up must come down um whether it comes
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
down here or somewhere else that's
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
really for the air people to understand
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's pretty technical um because it
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
depends on lots and lots and lots of
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
factors and you know I think that this
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
is not my a of expertise but I would
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
imagine that there was be all kinds of
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
pollution reduction Technologies
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
associated with anything like that so um
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean but but certainly this and
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
then you have to do something with the
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
residuals so what what do you do with
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
the ash what do you do with the fly ash
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
what do you do with the ash that comes
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
out of the scrubbers um that they take
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
out all that pollution all of that has
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
to go somewhere and that's you know can
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
become you know more of a problem than
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
the actual problem if you don't have a
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
good plan on how to do that so there's a
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
lot to think about uh with any of those
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
Technologies representative Derby thank
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you Mr de for taking
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
my question the senator brought up the
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
trained dment in East Palestine Ohio and
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
the water pollution how would the um how
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
would New Hampshire Dees respond if
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
there was such a a um such a travesty in
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um for um Municipal Water
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
Supplies it's a great question and you
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
know I'm we certainly have all of our
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water Supplies have emergency
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
action plans and we approve those
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
emergency action plans as part of their
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
annual or sometimes three every three
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
year depending on who you are um their
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
sanitary surveys so this is something
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
that is part and parcel of what water
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
systems are required to do we're also
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
now starting to see EPA have some
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
requirements for those kinds of
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
emergency situations with wastewater
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
treatment plants as well so there is a
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
lot of preparation going on for those
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of events and we have I think one
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
of the best in the nation spill response
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
you know programs um and so we have you
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
know people who are trained we have
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
people who who exercise on a regular
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
basis we have spills all the time in
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
this state and we respond all the time
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
in this state um you know you can't
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
prepare for everything and so there's
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know if something truly catastrophic
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
would happen it would be a full court
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
press from all resources across the
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
state um and that would be handled
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.509 align:start position:0%
 
agency

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
you um Mr deers again
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking at this study and the
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
date for the reporting out of is
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
November 1st of this year um if we were
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
to augment this would we want Dees to be
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
on this study and to contribute
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
information thank thank you for asking I
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
think we're certainly willing to
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
contribute information whether we sit on
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
a committee or not um so it I would say
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
that we would be if we were to be named
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
into a commission and especially if we
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
were to to be given some sort of a
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
leadership role on it we would probably
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
have concerns about uh Staffing
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
Resources is but but in terms of
 
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.430 align:start position:0%
Resources is but but in terms of
providing

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
information you want us we we'll be
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
Dar anyone else question by anyone
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
else representa thank you very much um
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
real quick the what was the uh bill that
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
the the other study that you referenced
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
you have the bill number the or the name
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
of it or I'm sorry I'm not sure which
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
which one the one you're the one you
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
were telling us that is already underway
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
to study the water oh this is the study
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we're doing is under is under the
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
um the the SE the the seast commission
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
on long-term goals and requirements for
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
drinking water this was a commission
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
that was created in
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
2019 and it's needs it's supposed to
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
complete all of its work by
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
2029 um and there they do have annual
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
reports of that committee I'm happy to
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%

345 Senator Murphy floor is yours thank
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman it's great to be back in
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
front of so many colleagues from the
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
house good to see you all again uh my
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
name is Keith Murphy I'm the senator for
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
District 16 which is Manchester's W one
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
towns of Goffstown hooks at candy and
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
Raymond um the Genesis of this bill was
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
that I received a call from a
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
constituent last summer and she said
 
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
constituent last summer and she said
Senator

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
Murphy I have been trying to take my
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
kids to Kingston State Park and
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes I go online and I can't make a
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
reservation because it's booked and
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes I can and when I go the
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
parking lot is always full full
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly full with cars from other
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
states and I don't think it's fair that
 
00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents can't go to the
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
park because we're basically booked out
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
of it and I said well let me look into
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
that and so I not living too far from
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
Kingston myself decided to try that and
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
the first time I went online it was
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
booked and then I booked for the next
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
week and I went and sure enough the
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
parking lot was probably
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
75% out of state
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
plates well maybe it was a family
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
reunion or something it was a one-off so
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
I tried it again a few weeks later and
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
it was the same thing
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at page three of this AAL
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
page document that I handed
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
out there's a chart with labeled
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
Kingston visitation 2023 by day and the
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
paragraphs Kingston State Park saw 49%
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
of his visitation from reservations last
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
season meaning they were made
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
online of those reservations 57% were
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
from out of state 43 from inate during
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
the five peak days reservations were
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
sold out I find it surprising that it's
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
only five but during the five that uh
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
they were sold out demographic shift was
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
67% out of state 33% in
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
state so I didn't think this was fair I
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
agreed with the constituent these are
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
parks that are owned by New Hampshire
 
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
residents they're owned by our citizens
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
and they should have some degree of
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
priority or some degree of preference
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
2third of Park visitors being of State
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
while we turn away inate residents did
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
not strike me as fair and
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
Equitable so I filed the bill and what
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
the bill says basically is Park fees
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
continue to be set by legislative
 
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.309 align:start position:0%
continue to be set by legislative
fiscal

00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
but where there are Park entry fees the
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
fees can be no more than 50% for instate
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
than they are for out of state and my
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
thinking wasn't that we would lower the
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
instate Park fees it's that we would
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
raise the outof state park fees and the
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
reason for that is if you look at the
 
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
single piece of paper here's a nice
 
00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.789 align:start position:0%
single piece of paper here's a nice
little

00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
graph nice little chart that spells out
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
what other states do to
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
us and I specifically want to point out
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Park entry
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
fees $5
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
to8 for residents non-residents meaning
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
we go to visit their state parks 20 to
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
$30 other states are doing this to us
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
but we treat everybody regardless of
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
where they come from at $4 they get in
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
the park
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
$4 my understanding is that fee has not
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
changed in over a decade so the park
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
fees are due for a
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
revision I want to talk for a second
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
about the Senate
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
hearing there was no opposition at the
 
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.829 align:start position:0%
hearing there was no opposition at the
Senate

00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:51:16.839 --> 00:51:19.710 align:start position:0%
Senate
hearing

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
and DNR came in and said we're not oppos
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
the bill we're neutral on the bill but
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
then they had a lot of reasons out the
 
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
blue why they oppose the
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill maybe you've been to hearings and
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
sat in hearings like that we're not
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
oppos the bill but and I want to address
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that I
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
note second paragraph it says that the
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
department States the impact the state
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
park fund is expected to result in a
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
decrease in
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue okay well that doesn't sound
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
good but if you look at the next
 
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph bullet point
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
one visitation data from 2023 would
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
remain the same with
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
999,000 and I'm going to try to
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
summarize a bit visitors in fiscal year
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
39% from residents 61% from
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
non-residents so you know that's that 6
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
61% you go to the next page the division
 
00:52:23.789 --> 00:52:23.799 align:start position:0%
assumed the maximum decrease of 50% in
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
day use fees bringing the average fees
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
from 450 to 225 for instate now I I
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
never suggested and I don't think
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
anybody ever suggested that the fees
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
would go from 450 to 225 that number was
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
sort of just pulled out of their
 
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
heads but even if that's what we did
 
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
even if that's what legislative fiscal
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
did it would be an increase in
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
Revenue because the very next line very
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
next bullet point is conversly division
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
assumed an increase of 1.5 times for the
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
non-resident adult fee increasing it to
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
four from 450 to
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
675 this change would would result in an
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
increase in State Park revenue uh of
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
1366 million well 1366 million minus the
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
loss they talking about of 860,000 still
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
means an increase in Revenue over a half
 
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
means an increase in Revenue over a half
million

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
so even with their numbers that they
 
00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
pulled out of their head without talking
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
to anybody in legislative
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal it's more money
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
and I just want to reiterate this is a
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
this is a legislative decision this is
 
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
not a decision that should be made by
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
the department they have input there
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee for a
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
reason that's where they bring their
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
opinions to when it comes to these fees
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and I'll conclude here Mr
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
chairman just want to make sure I got
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
all the points I wanted to
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
make the department is mandated to be an
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
run as an Enterprise fund what that
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
means is that it should Maxim maximiz
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
business businesses take care of their
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
owners now I'm happy that I own a
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
restaurant when I order a burger at my
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant I don't pay for my burger I
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
pay for it and then I purchase the food
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's used to make it and I pay for it
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the way that I I pay for the employee
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
who cooks it for me but I don't pay a
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
bill at the end of it well our parks are
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
owned by the people who live here and
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
why are we pay why are we charging them
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
the same fee as we charging somebody
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
park now there was one red herring
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
argument that came up and I want to talk
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
about that just for one second and that
 
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.510 align:start position:0%
about that just for one second and that
is

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
well we're going to reprogram the
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
website we're going to have to have the
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
person at the at the front gate uh check
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
the IDS and and identify every single
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
person walking you know coming in in the
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
car that's a red herring because the
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
bill is very simple and it says that
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
state that license plates are good
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
enough if a car pulls up and it's got
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
four people in it and the car has a
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts plate it's an out ofor if
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
the car drives up and it's got New
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plates that's an instate
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
resident car the the it's not meant to
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
be more work for anybody and that's why
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
it's drafted be very Broad and how it
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
identifies inst State versus out of
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
state so that concludes my comments Mr
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
chairman I appreciate the opportunity
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
there's any questions I'm happy to take
 
00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:28.109 align:start position:0%
there's any questions I'm happy to take
them

00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:55:28.119 --> 00:55:30.670 align:start position:0%
them
representative

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
Morgan thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
question we're talking about rates here
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh your initial issue was that the
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
individual from New Hampshire was
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
trouble getting
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
bookings what have we done for the
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
individual who is not getting a booking
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the cost is where's
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
the solution to that problem thank you
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the laws of
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
Economics say that if you charge more
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
for something you'll have less demand
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
for it ideally there'd be some more
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
openings for people from New Hampshire
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
truthfully I think that if the fees were
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
set at $4 and $8 that wouldn't drive
 
00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.829 align:start position:0%
set at $4 and $8 that wouldn't drive
anybody

00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
away so perhaps the answer is more
 
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
Parkland or open up the reservation
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
system and allow more people to enter I
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
will say that on the days that I did go
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
to Kingston there was plenty of parking
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
spaces there maybe the reservation
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
numbers are set a bit
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
low but I ideally there'd be a few maybe
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
a few less out of state residents or out
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
of state visitors but more spaces for
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire visitors I don't think $8
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
is going to send anybody away no one
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
that was going to come here for $4 in my
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
opinion is going to say well we're going
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
to go to new H Massachusetts parks
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
Because by the way they're charging
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
their residents $8 anyway so if they
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
were going to come to uh Massachusetts
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
or New Hampshire they still
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
will I hope I answered your
 
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.109 align:start position:0%
will I hope I answered your
question

00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you have a
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
followup or a followup
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so again we're talking about money
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
but the problem is with the bookings is
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
there a way to give the New Hampshire
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
resident uh some sort of priority in
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
making the bookings that would give them
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
the advantage over an out estator coming
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
in and tying up a slot I understand the
 
00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:22.039 align:start position:0%
question the easiest answer in my
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
opinion would simply to say that out of
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
the let's say we're looking at Kingston
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
right which has
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
a capacity
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
of reservation capacity is 385 people
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
simplest thing to do would be to say
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
well the first 150 or 200 spots would be
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
reserved for New Hampshire residents and
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
because when you go to the website you
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
enter your plate number and your state
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
of residence for that plate right so you
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
could say the first 150 or 200 spases
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
pick a number um would not be available
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
for out of state residents that would
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
save those spaces for New Hampshire
 
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.630 align:start position:0%
save those spaces for New Hampshire
people

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
the downside to that is you know I'm
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
very cognizant of the fact that we want
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
people to visit from out of state we
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily want them to not be
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
able to come on a day that isn't
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
busy um you know New Hampshire
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
businesses do benefit from having people
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
come in from from other places so I
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
would say that if the number was going
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
to be set that way and Reserve those
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
spaces for New Hampshire residents it
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
would have to be done at a at a fairly
 
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.270 align:start position:0%
would have to be done at a at a fairly
low

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
number so it's not to deter out of state
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
visitors thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative rung thank
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you senator for
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question we often get bills in
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
this committee about changing fee
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
structure and there was actually a bill
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
in state and federal this year that
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
would give a discount to retired
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
military people and I get the sense and
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
I and I want to know if you share it
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with this peace meal
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and you've brought up a very
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
important point about residents versus
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
non-residents but do you think it might
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
be a good idea to have this our whole
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
fee structure for all our Parks really
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
looked in in a comprehensive way because
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
what if somebody comes from out of state
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
but they're retired military and maybe
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
disabled you know it seems like there's
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
so many different factors we're putting
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
into the soup that we really it's really
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
difficult to see the big picture and
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
where the state parks you mentioned it
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that we really have
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
they're operated as an
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
Enterprise that maybe we we should
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
really take a bird's eyye view of all of
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
our fees all of our parks to see the
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
best mix that provides uh Financial
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
stability for the division thank you for
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
the question uh I will tell you ma'am
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
that I I spent a significant amount of
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
time going over all the park fees for
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
all the New England states Maine this
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
big thick packet
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts this is Vermont oh look
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
this is also Vermont and this probably
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
25 Pages here so I I certainly agree
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
with you in that this is a very complex
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
issue fees are very much due for
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
updating they are have not kept pace
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
anywhere near inflation I think if you
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
apply the inflation to the fee of $4 in
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
2012 I think you'd see it would probably
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
more than double um and I would not like
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
to see Park fees doubled for New
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents because frankly they
 
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
already face enough of a budget issue at
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
home as it is yes I think it is time to
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
take a wholesale look at the fee
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
structure but until the legislature does
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
that and maybe buet does a study
 
01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
committee and and goes through that
 
01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:43.039 align:start position:0%
whole process this is a nice simple one
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph solution um that may be a
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid but it's better than leaving it
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
at four hours for yet another
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
year followup Mr chair or followup would
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
you support an amendment that would
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee so so we can
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
get going on it right
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
away with maybe a couple Senators a few
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
representatives to we just had the
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
Senate come back we just heard a bill to
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
from a senator about setting up a study
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
committee but maybe you know spending
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
the summer doing exactly what you
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
described and coming forth in the fall
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
with a bill that looks at everything in
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
totality because yes this is this is a
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
quick fix but it's going to require some
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
changes new sign signage new information
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go through that
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
process why not do it for all the the
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
the all the fee
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
structure that's the will of the
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
committee I'll certainly respect it and
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
I would serve on that committee uh I
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
will say that on my side of the wall
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we're not too fond of committees uh
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
study committees in general because we
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
get we each get put on three or four of
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
them well I think I can get Senator avar
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
to support this one we'll do a little
 
01:01:54.839 --> 01:01:58.269 align:start position:0%
to support this one we'll do a little
yeah

01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
just a just for this bill is one of the
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh is a early bill so we have to make a
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
decision on what we do by in two weeks
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
so uh it's it's not one where we can
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
spend we have a we don't have a big time
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
for for a question thank you thank you
 
01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for bringing this
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
bill forward Senator um I think this
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
chart of the comparison with the other
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
New England Park fees is very telling
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
and um I I I don't think I gathered when
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
do you think I'm I'm surprised we
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything yet if you have
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
any idea why we haven't updated our fees
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
and when was the last time we updated
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
our fees if you mentioned it I missed it
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
thanks my understanding is that it's
 
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
been over a decade I don't want to speak
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
for the Department um I believe that
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
they have said to me that they are
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the fees and would propose
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be changed through
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal committee you know in the
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
near future I I don't want to put words
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
in their mouths however so um I agree
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
that they are very much due for an
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
update I also think that when we do it
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
if we don't do it with this bill it is
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
imperative that we look very closely at
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
what other states are charging us and
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
then if they're charging us more we do
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
them representative Derby for a question
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the language of
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
the bill talks about um entrance to
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
state parks um New Hampshire state parks
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
are are widely varied and include um
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
some ski location SK Resorts like um
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
Mount sop and Canon Mountain that are
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
based on tickets as opposed to um you
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
know that's that's how you sort of gain
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
entrance and so my my question is is
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
would it include those facilities and
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
would it um uh and have you thought
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
about using the language that other um
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
passes I would certainly welcome the
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
change to day pass language but it would
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
not be included if you look at the bill
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
the second line of the new text is the
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department may elect
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
to set separate fee
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
schedules for res residents and
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
non-residents for specific uses within
 
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
non-residents for specific uses within
the

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
park so you don't pay a fee at the gate
 
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.349 align:start position:0%
park so you don't pay a fee at the gate
to

01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
enter you know Cannon you pay when you
 
01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
buy the lift ticket that is that is a
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
specific fee so you know if I go to
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
Kingston and I rent a
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
canoe I pay a fee for that that is a use
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
so this allows the commissioner the
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
discretion to set a separate fee
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
structure if he or she chooses but it
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't require them to do so because I
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that it may not make sense in
 
01:04:57.599 --> 01:05:00.309 align:start position:0%
recognize that it may not make sense in
every

01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
case any other question representative W
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
looking at these fees of thank you for
 
01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
taking the question Excuse me yes
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
um you think this will necessarily
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
decrease the usage of these Parks or
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
will we get more out of state residents
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
in there taking up the spots I
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
understand I don't believe it will
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
it certainly will not lead to more out
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
ofate residents it may lead to slightly
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
less some people some small percentage
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
may be deterred by the fee going from $4
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
to8 as I told the other representative I
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
don't think that's likely to be the case
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's likely to stay all just
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
same in a way again I would be happy to
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
see a few less out of state visitors
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
visiting the parks um because that would
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
mean more space for New Hampshire
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
residents which was of course why the
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
place for a followup but the park system
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
is a self-funded agency so if we get an
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
overall decrease in Revenue that's going
 
01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.589 align:start position:0%
overall decrease in Revenue that's going
to

01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
hurt I think there's 0% chance of that
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
happening I am extremely confident of
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
that even using the
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
numbers provided by the agency in which
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
they predicted that we would they
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
assumed incorrectly in my opinion that
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
we will lower the fee from 450 to 225
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
for instate residents but increase out
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
of sters from 450 to 675 even if we did
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
that it would generate more than a half
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars in new
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
revenue and I did not in any way shape
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
or form suppose or recommend that the
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
fee would be cut for in inate residents
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
I think it set at $4 where it has been
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
for over a decade we went to$ four and8
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
let's run those
 
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.029 align:start position:0%
let's run those
numbers

01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be significantly
 
01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.589 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be significantly
more

01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue questions by anyone
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
Haley thank you for taking my question U
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
getting back to representative of
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
organ's uh question about capacity I
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
think the easiest way to control the
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
capacity is let in-state residents
 
01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.470 align:start position:0%
capacity is let in-state residents
Reserve

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
Reserve
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
earlier and then let the out of state
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
residents two days or a week later
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's probably the best way to control
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
capacity that's how a lot of places
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
control capacity for you know concerts
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
or anything else and I think that's the
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
way you should be looking at that's a
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
solid recommendation and that's one I
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
would endorse I also want to say that in
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate we don't typically get a lot
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
of questions when we introduce bills
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's heartening for me and a good
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
flashback for me to be in front of the
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
house again where I I get actual
 
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.150 align:start position:0%
house again where I I get actual
questions

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we got time to
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
there recognizes Brian

substantial adverse impact on tourism

attract out of-state residents is is
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
some of that um not just to fund the

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
State Park systems in the country what I
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
mean by that is we're operationally
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
self-supported so um of our $40 million
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
operating budget only 1% of that for our
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau of historic sites uh comes from
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
General funding all of the rest of it is
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
produced by people who come to visit or
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
camp or pay a parking fee or an
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
overnight camping fee so the
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh of dncr already has the
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
authority under statute when that system
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
was created that way to create our fee
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
structure and be able to do that uh uh
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
and and provide so that we can maintain
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
that that structure in the way that the
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
system system is set up as
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient so we we we pride
 
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves in in operating in that in
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
that uh mindset that um everything that
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
we look at is you know from an
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
analytical standpoint um a lot of the
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
data uh that was shared by Senator
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
Murphy was data that our division
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
produced um to follow up on questions
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
that he had uh relative this to this
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
bill and uh s we've started this
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
reservation system for dayuse visits a
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
few years ago um we now have a lot more
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
information at our fingertips than we
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
ever had before relative to who is
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
coming to visit where they're coming
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
from and and that information that we
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
intend to use uh as part of our own
 
01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
process of going going forward so um
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
because the fee package is uh big and
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh complexity in it um
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
we were taking an approach of kind of
 
01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:25.550 align:start position:0%
we were taking an approach of kind of
taking

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
um smaller bites off of it if you will
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
with respect to our metered parking we
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
did first Canon mountain is its own
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
separate uh piece our camping we did a
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
piece just just for camping and really
 
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
the the the last piece was for us to to
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
take a a close look at what the day use
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
fees um what I I also want to I think is
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
very important to understand too
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
relative to New Hampshire being self
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
funded is none of those surrounding
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
states Massachusetts Main Vermont or
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
anything they are not self-supported um
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
so they are getting getting tens and
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars of general
 
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
fund support for their park system I
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
spoke with the director of Massachusetts
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
state parks relative this bill their
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
fees are so high there uh because a
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the time wanted to set
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
the fees to discourage people during
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
covid to come to Parks during
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the fees have not been
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
reset since um so they get complain
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
after complaint after complaint about
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
people who are from out of state why
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
would I have to pay $30 to come to
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
Walden Pond State Reservation
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's how they set the fee New
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is different and unique in a
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
way where we rely on hospitality and
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
tourism uh as uh one of our main
 
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
economic drivers here and the park
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
system is really set up uh to um to help
 
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
way representative R
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you representative R and
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I've
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
seen the discussion of fees on various
 
01:18:58.629 --> 01:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
departments this year uh especially in
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture where they
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
hadn't raised the fees in 15 years when
 
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
was the last time that the day fees Park
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
entry fees were raised sure the last
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
time the day use fees were raised was in
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
2012 so over a dozen years ago
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
yep and follow up for a
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
followup and you have within your
 
01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:25.550 align:start position:0%
followup and you have within your
abilities

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
abilities
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
the right to raise the fees at your
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you got representative
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
run thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Wilson so you you
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
talked about how you've been working
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
kind of peac meal at different aspects
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the fee structure to address them and
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
bring them to the fiscal committee um
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
how far are you through that process
 
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the different various
 
01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
segments of
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
fees um thank you for the question so uh
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
the the day use fees is really kind of
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
the the last uh significant piece of
 
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue um that we would be going after
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
so um about $4 million is can be
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
attributed and of our annual uh Revenue
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
can be attributed to deuse deuse fees um
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
so um that's a that's a good chunk that
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
we recognize um a few things one is that
 
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.189 align:start position:0%
we recognize um a few things one is that
uh

01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
it it's been over a decade since those
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
fees were adjusted um however we've been
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
able to operate the park system within
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
our self-funding model for that time so
 
01:20:36.189 --> 01:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to kind of thread the
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
needle if you will with respect to
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
keeping the fees as low as possible to
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
encourage folks both inst State and out
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
of state to be able to come and enjoy
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
the park system but at uh um at at at
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
the threshold where we're able to
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
generate enough Revenue to to operate um
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
now uh other costs have gone up uh you
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
know for us you know relative to
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
Staffing and everything in the world
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
really uh everything that we do is more
 
01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
expensive now so that's why we're you
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
know been taking a more concerted effort
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
and and tackle the campground fees which
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
was also the first time in 10 years that
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's been updated so that was just
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
done uh last uh December um so I hope
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
that answered your question yeah follow
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
up Mr chair um so do you also part of
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
your budget do you for any capital
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
reserve funding or Capital expenditures
 
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
for improvements does that come out of
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
your operating budget um not really I
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
would I would classify that as
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance so where um we we do a
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
certain level of of Maintenance and
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
improvements within our operating budget
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
um but we do rely on the cap the state
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
capital budget process to help uh fund
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
um projects that are larger and more
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
costly in nature in terms of whether
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's a major renovation or restoration
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
or something or Improvement or expansion
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay and and just one more Mr chair um
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 2019 your division came to
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
this committee to give like an
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
orientation early in the term and I
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
found it very helpful and I would like
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
to suggest that perhaps in the next
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
several months you know might by the end
 
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
of the year early next year you consider
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
doing that because what I struggle with
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
is we have bills like this come in and
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
there was a similar bill that went to
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
state and federal that would give a
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
discount to active or retired military
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
personnel and um it just seems kind of
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
disjointed so it would be helpful to
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
have like a presentation about all of
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
this and maybe it will come after your
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
the day fee analysis that you do but if
 
01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
you could think about keeping us in the
 
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
loop about and being proactive about
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
communicating about your division so
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
that we're better informed when these
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
kind bills come through it would be
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
helpful great thank you we would love
 
01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.110 align:start position:0%
helpful great thank you we would love
that

01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for another question
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question the
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
fees that are listed on this sheet I
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
guess that uh Senator Donovan prepared
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
is uh is this accurate that it's $29 for
 
01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.629 align:start position:0%
is uh is this accurate that it's $29 for
night

01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
camping um I don't have that in in front
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
of me so I'm not sure what
 
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:30.590 align:start position:0%
of me so I'm not sure what
you're

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
question um yes um our our camping fee
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
schedule is Al also complex so I I was
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
hoping not to be quizzed on uh the rates
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
for for for the camping uh they vary
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
from uh primitive sites to uh full
 
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
hookup sites
 
01:23:59.310 --> 01:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
um so $29 does sound like one of one of
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
those rate structures for for relative
 
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.629 align:start position:0%
those rate structures for for relative
to

01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
Camping follow through with that for a
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
followup if it's $29 why is the instate
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
rate if we have problems with
 
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
capacity um so we don't really have
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
problems with capacity relative to uh to
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
our campgrounds and um differentiating
 
01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
rate structures between residents and
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
non-residents was something that we the
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
department weighed when we went to um
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
update our camping uh fees uh last year
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
and we opted not to separate and and
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
create a differential between uh a
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.310 align:start position:0%
 
camping

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
camping
 
01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.830 align:start position:0%
camping
why

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
they say because um yeah I it's it's
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's a few things is is
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
one is um the way that we've been
 
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
operating for quite a while now has had
 
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
the rates the same across the board
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
which makes implementation of that a lot
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
easier so if you were from out of state
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
and you went online to uh make a
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
reservation to come camping and you
 
01:25:22.109 --> 01:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
would put in a bunch of information um
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
um what we what we see as folks will say
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
that they're from New Hampshire but
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
they're not really from New Hampshire
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
and they but they'll book it that way
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
and then we've got to re- reccon that at
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
the time that they arrive uh for camping
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
and there are quite a few very Savvy
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
campers out there who do this kind of
 
01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
thing for a living where they'll create
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
several accounts with different
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
addresses and things like that to try to
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
game the system if you will um so
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
implementation of um verifying residency
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
for camping was was was something that
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
time is anyone else for
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
G do you still have the senior discounts
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
for camping and uh well that's the only
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
one I think I know
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
of yes and I'm glad you asked thank you
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
so relative to uh the dayuse fees our
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
current package has several uh comps and
 
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.510 align:start position:0%
current package has several uh comps and
discounts

01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
discounts
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
including uh for state
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
employees um for um the general court
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
and um for military uh for New Hampshire
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans for New Hampshire
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
National Guard for New Hampshire seniors
 
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh it is free it is not free for 65 and
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
older if you're out of state so there's
 
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
a whole menu within our current fee
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
package that allows for the opportunity
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
for either free or deep discounted
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
access for for day use uh the the state
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
park license plate is probably the best
 
01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
example um it's a discounted season pass
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh essentially that is only able to
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for if you have a New Hampshire
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
reg registered vehicle um and then we
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
also have Library passes as well too at
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
most local libraries that anybody who
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
really wants to get to a park that can't
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
afford the fee uh can go and take that
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
library anyone
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

nonprofit cultural institutions in the

two million visitors and presently see

about a 100,000 folks through our doors
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
every season I'm here to voice my
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
concerns and and express my opposition
 
01:28:43.119 --> 01:28:44.510 align:start position:0%
concerns and and express my opposition
to

01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
345 believing it will have significant
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
adverse impacts to the SEO Science
 
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
Center in in terms of both reducing our
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
mission impact and Mission footprint in
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the the number of people we can
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh post every year and as well as uh
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps threatening our financial
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
stability as a smaller nonprofit
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
institution in our view as has been
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussed here parks would have no real
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
option under SB 345 other than to double
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
fees I've provided a brief summary
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
document all of you that kind of goes
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
through our case and thought process
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
both in terms of the implications on our
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
mission the implications to our
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
financial situation and and uh some
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
window into the logistical complications
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
that this would create as a partner
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
operating within the state
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
park based on 2023 admissions
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
data around 100,000 visitors I think we
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
had 98,000 visitors 43% of those folks
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
are from out of
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
state in 2023 we earned
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
$390,000 of admissions revenue and what
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
that would mean is that with 43% of
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
those folks coming from out of state
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
that puts
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
$160,000 of Revenue in Jeopardy should
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
out ofate visitors be disincentivized to
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
Center if in a ballpark scenario we lost
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
half of those out of state visitors
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
which I think
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
is perhaps a reasonable
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
assumption because what's happening in a
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
place like the science center the price
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
to admissions to the park and the
 
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
science center is seen by a visitor as
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
an aggregate fee when we calculate our
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
admission fees We Lay the parks fee on
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
top of that to come to some
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
understanding of the psychology of the
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
customer coming through the door and
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
what they're willing to spend for a
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
family of four to come and visit and
 
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
weigh that against what we feel the
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
value of the experience at the center is
 
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
so I think we could see upwards of half
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
declining so let's say that was
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
$80,000 if we were to lose $80,000 of
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
our admissions
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
revenue for us that's
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
1.5-2 full-time equivalents we would be
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
forced to to reconfigure Staffing we
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
would have to reschedule and
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
redistribute probably to absorb absorb
 
01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.590 align:start position:0%
redistribute probably to absorb absorb
that

01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
loss should New Hampshire parks double
 
01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.310 align:start position:0%
loss should New Hampshire parks double
the

01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
fee um and lose less than 50% of the
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
visitation as has been discussed they
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
make more money there's no question
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
about that SEO Science Center as a
 
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
partner within the park loses money for
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
every out ofate visitor that doesn't
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
come there is no model here where we can
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
claw back uh any of those
 
01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.390 align:start position:0%
claw back uh any of those
revenues

01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
disincentivized we are about customer
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
service that's how we have been
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
successful we provide a highquality
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
education product we provide a high
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
quality experience within the park
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
interpreting the park um and the way we
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
treat our visitors is of Paramount
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
important to us one of the impediments
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
that we address dayto day because we're
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
the people on the ground is a profoundly
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
complicated fee Matrix and I've I've got
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
an example of it here but it's
 
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's Science Center fees it's it's Parks
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
fees Library fees participants in
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%

University of New Hampshire and it kind
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
of goes on and on and on and what this
 
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
creates from a customer service point of
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
view yes there's clear and clean answers
 
01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
for all of that as you addressed me at
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
the at the uh at the admissions
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
counter but it's a big story to tell and
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
it's often not easy to tell when we have
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
a line of visitors trying to get into
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
into the facility so complications in
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
that area present logistical challenges
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
for for us that impede our uh ability to
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
provide exemplary customer service which
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
is something we're very proud of we now
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
use an online ticketing pre-reservation
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
Service as well it's it's strangely one
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the Silver Linings of Co brought us
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
to a place where we did that timed
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
ticketing timed entry better
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
coordination with parks and collecting
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
dayuse fees at present we collect dayuse
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
fees for New Hampshire parks for
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
visitors who would normally never pay
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
them as they would come in during the
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
offseason at parks if someone comes to
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
visit us in November when there's nobody
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
no Park staff available they'll register
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
online they'll pay their fees for the
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
science center we also charge them the
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
state park dayuse fee we collect that
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
hold it in a liability account and
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
redistribute that back to Parks I think
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
in 2023 that was about $52,000 from odor
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
that we collected on Park's behalf and
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
passed passed back
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
through I guess in summary I'm I'm
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about the impact certainly the
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
financial impact of the science center
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
with loss of that Revenue I'm I'm
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
concerned that it will erode that
 
01:34:19.159 --> 01:34:20.310 align:start position:0%
concerned that it will erode that
visitor

01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
visitor
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
experience and to give you a sense of
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
the resource that we have operating
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
within the park part of my job is to
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
toot our own horn I suppose so forgive
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
me for a second the quality of the
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
visitor experience in February USA Today
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
released a national survey they surveyed
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
170 aquarium like institutions Across
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
America and they looked at the visitor
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
response the the the the the Yelp
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
reviews the Google reviews the customer
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
service reviews from all of those
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
organizations and they assess the
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
highest quality visitor experience and
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
beauty of the
 
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.189 align:start position:0%
beauty of the
aquarium

01:35:02.189 --> 01:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
aquarium
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
Fifth Fifth in the nation out of 170
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
because the experience that our staff is
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
able to provide and is very focused on
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the spectacular location that we're
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
afforded within oror Point State Park
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
those combined for a a profound draw and
 
01:35:21.239 --> 01:35:21.990 align:start position:0%
those combined for a a profound draw and
and

01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
benefit um
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
I think that SEO Science Center and odor
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
Point State Park and New Hampshire parks
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
is really a stellar example of a public
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
private partnership within New
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I honestly think it should
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
something that should be celebrated and
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
cultivated rather than impeded by what I
 
01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.470 align:start position:0%
cultivated rather than impeded by what I
think

01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
is perhaps unintentionally from our
 
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
perspective short-sided
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um I ask that you give this
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
this perspective that I've shared uh
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
serious consideration as you work
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
through the disposition of this of this
 
01:35:59.950 --> 01:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
bill I thank you for your time and
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
attention I'm happy to answer questions
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I and I have also provided contact
 
01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
information for me on the back of that
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
sheet should somebody want to follow up
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
on any other matters related to the
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
Science Center thanks for your time any
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the committee
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative Ron thank you Mr chair
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
question and maybe Mr Wilson can help
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
out with this but of the people can go
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
go to odor State Park and not go to the
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
Science Center how many of
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
those what what are the numbers look
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
like like like what percentage of people
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
that go to odor State part do not go to
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
the Science
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
Center we are actually aggregating and
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
working through those data now it hasn't
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
been for the last two years since we
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
both went to online ticketing that we
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
could even begin to wrestle with it the
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
preliminary work is
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
that Science Center is the primary d for
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of the visitation um is it 80% no
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
is it 50 to
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
70% sometimes of the Year absolutely so
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
I won't say we are the sole most
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
significant it's a big piece of the PT
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
and we'll have those data in the coming
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
months as we finish working through them
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
because frankly we want to desperately
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
you more questions seeing none

the committee I'm Senator David Waters
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
District 4 to introduce Senate Bill
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
387 relative to State Parks uh pass
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
pilot program for Recovery centers and
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers um as
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
you see from the bill what it proposes
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
to do is as a pilot program which would
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
provide um as we do in the State Library
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
uh program a uh pass for use by
 
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
participants in a state registered
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
Recovery Center or Community Mental
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
Health Center um we have about 30 of
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
those around the state uh and these are
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
ones that uh would be able to have the
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
folks using their services have the
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
benefits to both recovery and mental
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
health by being able to be out outside
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
um we also have since it's a pilot
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
program a mechanism here for an
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
anonymized collection of data to see how
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
the program is going who's using it um
 
01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:44.679 align:start position:0%
what kind of results again anonymize
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we can be given from the recovery
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
center and the community M uh health
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
health centers as to the uh impacts of
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
the of the program
 
01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
program um I will just uh say briefly um
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
that we heard a lot of testimony in the
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
senate about the all the extensive
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
research about the benefits of outdoor
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
recreational experiences uh for people
 
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
with mental health uh issues and the
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
case all the work that I do with the
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
recovery centers uh the case I believe
 
01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
is is the same and so there is extensive
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
research on on that and uh really quite
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary uh benefits that are seen
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
from it I come also as a member of the
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
governor's uh Commission on alcohol and
 
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh other other drugs and uh we have
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
discussed this program on that
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
commission and uh Patrick tus who is the
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission uh has said that
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
I can express his intent should this
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
bill passes to use some of our grant
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
funding for the
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
$3,000 that will cover the costs so that
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
while the Parks generously said they
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
might on the pilot program be able to
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
provide this I think what we've heard
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
about the uh budgeting and the financing
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the dependence on the park through
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
admissions that I would like to be able
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
to support this with grant funding and I
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
can assure you that we'll be able to
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
find those $3,000 uh to support this
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
pilot program so it's about $105 a pass
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
um for each each Center and uh they can
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
give it out to somebody to go go use it
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
on a on for for the day and um then they
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
come back and return the pass and uh so
 
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's how it would work for
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
these these centers
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
um I think I just would like to say on a
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
personal note that some of us may have
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
recognized the importance of being able
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
to get out outside out to the parks
 
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
during Co epidemic when I think we were
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
all under a lot of mental mental health
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
stress during that period And I think
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
that that is a testimony that we have
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
certainly across the state and uh given
 
01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
the res search that this can really
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
particularly help uh people who are
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
served the 60,000 people are served by
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
our community mental health centers and
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
the untold thousands who are uh in in
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
recovery and served by our um again our
 
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
our state registered um recovery centers
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
that this would be a a good thing we'll
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
be able to get some data see how how it
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
works so I hope that they'll have your
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
support and I we'll be glad to take any
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
questions any questions of the senator
 
01:42:24.669 --> 01:42:24.679 align:start position:0%
repr represent ative Darby thank you Mr
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
chair thank you senator for taking my
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
question um just a um lack of
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
understanding on my part so the bill
 
01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
talks about recovery centers and
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers at the
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
beginning can you describe the
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
difference between the
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
two uh oh yes I mean it's it's in their
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
mission uh Community Mental Health
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
Centers uh deal with all kinds of um uh
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
folks many of whom are um on Medicaid or
 
01:42:51.629 --> 01:42:51.639 align:start position:0%
Social Security Disability or
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
supplemental security
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh in insurance and um it's really a
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
this these programs are a safety net for
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
mental healthiness or emotional
 
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
disorders so across all kinds of
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
conditions recovery centers again these
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are registered with
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
the state as eligible for State funding
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of supervision there's a
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of data there's a lot of
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
rules that are followed these are the
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
people who are help the the recovery
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
centers are helping folks who are in
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
recovery these are registered with
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services so that they Pro
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
programs are approved and the funding
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
that comes through the governor's
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
commission and from other uh sources um
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
is supervised by that so that that's why
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
it's this is very much delimited to
 
01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
places that the state has confidence in
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
our serving or clients well and if they
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
would manage a program like this
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
appropriately followup for a followup
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair um on line nine
 
01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
um you talked about the anonymized DAT
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
data collection yeah on line nine it
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
says participating Community Mental
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
Health Center shall report this but it
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about the recovery centers
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
is the intent that they would both
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
I the um Community Health Center I I
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
think there's a a possibility and
 
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
methodology for that I wouldn't say that
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
it'll become a proxy for the recovery
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
centers but this will not I was nervous
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
about putting a a a reporting burden on
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
the recovery centers I think you know
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
certainly we can ask them how it's going
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
and so and so forth but with hipper
 
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
provisions and otherwise this was one
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
that could could work um through with
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
the Hipp of restraints on providing
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
information about in individuals about
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
their health care um so I I that that's
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
why I differentiated that way and so I
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
hope that I hope that thank the question
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
because I hope that will be satisfactory
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
but I I I think that it this is kind of
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
reflects the state of what we think we
 
01:45:00.199 --> 01:45:01.470 align:start position:0%
reflects the state of what we think we
can

01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
do representative Morgan for question
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh if I heard you
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
correctly there's 30 facilities that
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
would uh require a pass and is it a pass
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
for the facility or a number of passes
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
for a number of individuals or group
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
passes how does that pass situation work
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
for each facility what would the
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
associated fee be thanks for your
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
question I think we we'll hear it is
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
kind of like the state park um Library
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
Pass Program which the libraries pay for
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
as well and uh so um it is in the
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
possession of the center if somebody
 
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
wants to use it it's an individual who
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
can then take the pass and present it at
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
a an eligible State Park so that that's
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
the that's the limitation to it it's not
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
groups um it's one individual and that
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:45:57.629 --> 01:45:57.639 align:start position:0%
the N the uh about the the 20 recovery
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
centers and the 10 Community Mental
 
01:45:59.199 --> 01:46:00.390 align:start position:0%
centers and the 10 Community Mental
Health

01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
Centers for
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
followup thank you the I just want to
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
understand is there one pass issued for
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
each facility or is there a number of
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
passes that they can give to one
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
individual at a time thanks because one
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
per facilities okay yeah thank you
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
sir representative R for question thank
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so when I see this as
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
a pilot I see it that's a test and um
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
who who will report the results or or
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
who to whom will the reports be the
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
results be reported to and what would
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
the criteria be to assess the success of
 
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
it and and how would you define the what
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
it you know um thank you for your
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
question and
 
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.629 align:start position:0%
question and
[Music]

01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:51.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe you might want to add
 
01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
something on 12 an amendment okay um
 
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
that would suggest to whom that should
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
go I uh I mean obviously it's going to
 
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
be an
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
HHS okay um but what uh I I had imagined
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
that this would go to the Commissioners
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner Department of Natural
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
culture resources and to the uh
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health Human Services I
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's who I imagined it but
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
you know it might be useful for this
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee and for Senate HHS to receive
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
that report as well so whatever you
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
think is best on that okay my my in
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
putting together I just assume the
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
reporting would be going to the uh two
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because then we could ask
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
them how to go in two years and decide
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
what we want to do at that point but if
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
you think it would be good for us
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislators to have a report too fine
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I follow up yeah and um but the
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
reporting especially since it's going
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
going to two different Commissioners or
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
that that's what an amendment would
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
reflect how is the are each Center going
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
to have their own is it going to be a
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
standardized reporting form I'm just
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
looking at those Commissioners are going
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
to get are going to receive the report
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
they'll be assessing whether the pilot
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
was successful or not but the criteria
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
that they'll make that determination
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
would be based on a report that should
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
be standardized so who should be
 
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
preparing should they be preparing the
 
01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
pilot um evaluation
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
form thanks for the question
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
um I think because the pilot I just
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
tried to keep it real simple because it
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to be the ones who decide
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's Su success or not right
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's a pilot program if we want to keep
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
it going in statute which we'd have to
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
do we'll be the ones who would would
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
decide so um that's why I thought it it
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
would it could be a fairly simple
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
written report um that would include
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
what they thought was relevant for us to
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
know but again if you think that it
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be important to have that more
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
more detailed and specified I you know
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of this committee is is
 
01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:07.719 align:start position:0%
nearly infinite Mr chairman nearly
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
nearly yes yeah how many thank you how
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
many angels can dance on the head of a
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
pin any other questions for members of
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you Mr
 
01:49:21.719 --> 01:49:27.109 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you Mr
chman

01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
next person Brian
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
resources good morning again committee
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
members I'm Brian Wilson director of
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
division of Parks and Recreation um I
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
sorry um I will spare uh reading my
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
testimony into the record here uh some
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
of it uh resembles uh some of some of
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
the language in the last just with
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
regard to explaining our self-funded
 
01:50:07.709 --> 01:50:07.719 align:start position:0%
model here um we're we we support this
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
this pilot um and appreciate the
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
Senator's uh willingness to reach out to
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
the department to discuss the
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
particulars around that so that we
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
thought that we could uh coales around
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
um a a a good program um so we
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and um we we do also
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
recognize the value of uh outdoor
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
recreation on on folks both mental and
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
physical health here and uh would would
 
01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
support uh this as as a pilot um
 
01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
relative to some of the conversation
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
regarding re reporting um we uh also at
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
the department hadn't thought uh a whole
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
lot about that but we would have um
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to be able to provide uh data
 
01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the free frequency or the
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
the number of visitations either uh
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
unique to each uh Center um or or or or
 
01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:02.199 align:start position:0%
more broadly um so I feel like that is
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
something that um between uh HHS and
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
dncr that we could work out uh the
 
01:51:10.589 --> 01:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
particulars of that um but I I would um
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh be supportive of any you know other
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
amended language as well too that
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
required any you know uh official
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
reporting out whether it's to this
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
committee or or otherwise um that is
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
also something that similarly happens
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
with other
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh Pilots or some other uh programs that
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
purview any any other questions by
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative Derby thank you
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you for taking my
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
question just um related to an earlier
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
question to the senator um what's your
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
perspective on how um this this these
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
passes would be used by the by the
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
centers yeah so uh my understanding is
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably it's the closest
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
resemblance to our library Pass Program
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
in that there would be a one physical
 
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
pass available uh uh at each Center some
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
level of uh promotion or awareness at
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
those centers that these exist uh and uh
 
01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
to um for those that want to take the
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that and that it would
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
be unique um uh so the way that it works
 
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
with the library passes uh for instance
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
is if somebody shows up at a at a state
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
State Park um where we're charging we're
 
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:27.639 align:start position:0%
charging a fee um through our point of
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
Sal system we're able to enter uh a
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
unique uh ID number U that's uh
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
connected to that pass so that we can
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
produce re reporting uh for that and and
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
track where where you know where they
 
01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
where they came from um we don't really
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
do a whole lot of analysis on the
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
library program uh for instance it's
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
been something that's been set within uh
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
the fee structure for for a long time
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
and and is a great program
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh but I would see this being being
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
well representative har question thank
 
01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
question um it struck me why can't the
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
$105

01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
$105
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
um the passes uh uh a a pass for $105 is
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
in our current fee package it's either
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh unique to an individual ual
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
purchasing a season pass um or in the
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
instance of the libraries it would be
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know unique to a physical place um
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
or or or Center so um you would not be
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
able to do that every individual at
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's um participating or a a client at
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
a Recovery Center would need to get
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
their own season pass if if it were to
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
fall under our current uh fee package
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for a followup so
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
could you administratively go in and
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
amend your administrative rules or regs
 
01:54:02.109 --> 01:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
to have a line item that says centers
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
can get the pass without having a bill
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
to tell you to do that yes we could um
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
go to uh the fiscal committee to uh make
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
a a change to our fee package to allow
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
for a program that mirrors uh this
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%

anxiety or
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
depression and of those experiencing a

mental illness 70,000 adults in our
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
state did not receive any
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
treatment um as you've heard the
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
research overwhelmingly shows that
 
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreational activities have a
 
01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
positive impact on Mental Health um this
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
does include older adults with serious

01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
experiencing symptoms of anxiety and
 
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
depression uh stud have found that
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
nature-based interventions including
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
Forest therapies with an emphasis on
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
immersion in nature had a significant

effect on the reduction of anxiety and
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
depression um as you've heard there's 10
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers um one
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
of them is here today to speak um which
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
is wonderful to be able to hear from
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
them as well um and as you've heard in
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
2022 they served over 60,000 Unique
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
Individuals in our state um they do
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
serve as a primary safety
 
01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.790 align:start position:0%
serve as a primary safety
net

01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
net
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
and in 2022 70% of the clientele that
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
they served are on Medicaid which means
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
um most of these folks as you've heard
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
are on Social Security Disability or
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
supplemental security income and they do
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
not have the funds to be able to
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
purchase um daily passes or a season
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
park pass for themselves um because they
 
01:57:20.669 --> 01:57:20.679 align:start position:0%
have very little money left over at the
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
end of the month after paying for their
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
rent their food their you know for
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
transportation um and everything else
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
that we all have to pay for um so
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
knowing that knowing how many people
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
receive Services through the Community
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers and knowing that
 
01:57:39.629 --> 01:57:39.639 align:start position:0%
it's posit would have a positive impact
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
for them and also knowing these are
 
01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
folks that can't afford to buy their own
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
passes um this would be a really great
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
pilot program um going forward and I
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um speak to
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative har question about
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
changing the rules and I think that
 
01:57:58.109 --> 01:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
because this is a pilot I think letting
 
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
it go as a pilot to see how it works and
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
see you know if folks are actually using
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
the passes would be a good way to then
 
01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:07.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
direct um the the department to change
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
rules if it is a successful program but
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
I think that having this go forward as
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
it is right now would be um really
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
important for the folks that are served
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
by the Community Mental Health Centers
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
um um so I urge you to seriously
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
consider this legislation and vote ought
 
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.950 align:start position:0%
consider this legislation and vote ought
to

01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
pass any questions for members of the
 
01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:34.830 align:start position:0%
pass any questions for members of the
committee

01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Holly for taking my question
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of thinking about that
 
01:58:44.430 --> 01:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
reporting when the Pilot's over and
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
reporting to the commissioner of DHHS
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
and um the parks and what success looks
 
01:58:53.310 --> 01:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
like but in your testimony you've said
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
that there's clear research that always
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
shows the Ben the mental health benefit
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
of having um people partake in the
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
natural environment so would you
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
recommend then that that report that
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
gets submitted at the end of the pilot
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
focus more on
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
usage things like that like since we've
 
01:59:13.069 --> 01:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
already because I was thinking the
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
report would maybe include information
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
about um the Improvement of someone's
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
mental health in participating in the
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
pilot but if if if we can already
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
establish that as as a certainty would
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
you how how would you look to have that
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
um report filed like what criteria would
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
you recommend be included in it and when
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
you asked that question before I started
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know what would
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
success look like and I think success
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
would look like are people using the
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
passes um and I think that that's the
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
most crucial part of the reporting not
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
what their diagnosis is not you know did
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
their mental health improve but you know
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
just where people actually using the
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
passes would would dictate I think
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%

the senator yeah just for for
 
02:00:20.669 --> 02:00:20.679 align:start position:0%

clarification but yes those 10 mental
 
02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:38.119 align:start position:0%

testimony um I'm here as a Riverbend

employee um and Riverbend is one of the
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
10 Community Mental Health Centers and I
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
am definitely in favor of this bill
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the state um park passes for
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
mental health centers um as PE you've
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
already heard Riverbend is one of 10
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers in
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
conquer serving over
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
60,000 um clients throughout the state
 
02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
um and Riverbend itself serves about 30
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
communities in central New Hampshire so
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
we're in the sort of conquered marrat
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
County area um our clients include both
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
adults and children and um generally
 
02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
people that have a very serious mental
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
health conditions and that affect their
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
daily functioning and very limited
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
resources um thus limiting their ability
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
to access things that cost money such as
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
the state parks
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
um during my many years at Riverbend
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
I've actually had a lot of firsthand
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
experience of how beneficial the
 
02:02:03.390 --> 02:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
outdoors is for our clients um I've had
 
02:02:06.069 --> 02:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
a couple of outdoor adventure groups and
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
we currently have um a Stress Management
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
and social skills group that regularly
 
02:02:14.830 --> 02:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
meets Outdoors during the summer months
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
and um clients often ask about going to
 
02:02:21.629 --> 02:02:21.639 align:start position:0%
the state parks um specifically because
 
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
they like to go swimming and there
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
aren't a lot of places with lifeguards
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
um you know where they have good
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
swimming spots so we've had a lot of
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
request for the state parks and usually
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
we have to say it's too expensive um
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
people don't have the the money to come
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
up with themselves and Riverbend on
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
occasion has um we've taken from our own
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
funds from Riverbend to fund a special
 
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
group to a state park so we have been
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
able to occasionally over the years
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
utilize some of the state parks for some
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
special activities but um this bill
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
would I feel be very beneficial to
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
people um whether it's you know
 
02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:03.639 align:start position:0%
individually or as a a group um I think
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
it would be there would be a lot of um
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
demand for it and certainly a lot of
 
02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:10.350 align:start position:0%
demand for it and certainly a lot of
benefit

02:03:10.350 --> 02:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think that's pretty much all I
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
have I I'm an outdoor Enthusiast myself
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
and I love being outdoors with the
 
02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
clients that we serve and I've I think
 
02:03:24.069 --> 02:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's one of the greatest Services we can
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
offer people um especially with our
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
beautiful surroundings here in New
 
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so any questions by any
 
02:03:34.589 --> 02:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
 
02:03:34.599 --> 02:03:36.030 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
L

02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
L
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
montin thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you think some
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
of your clients would have
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
transportation difficulty getting to the
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
state park and what do you think would
 
02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
be solutions for that one thing just as
 
02:03:53.069 --> 02:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
I'm listening to T Tony a little bit too
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
I think many of our clients also would
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
not be able to necessarily access the
 
02:04:02.109 --> 02:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
part by themselves a lot of the services
 
02:04:04.990 --> 02:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
we provide now where a staff person is
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with a client or in some of
 
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
the cases we've had small groups of
 
02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
clients with the staff or two um so this
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
in that case the staff provide the
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
transportation um you know and I don't
 
02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
know if this bill would include the pass
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
for the assist the sort of the staff
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
person who would be providing support
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
for the client to be able to access the
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
state park um I think in the past when
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
we have utilized a I think it's called
 
02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
the state park bus pass program which
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is only for children um it
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
was set up like that there would be a I
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
think it was a 10: one ratio um but
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
there would be a sort of like a bus pass
 
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
so the the transportation in the bus or
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
the van would include the 10 clients and
 
02:04:59.790 --> 02:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
the one or two staff um and everyone's
 
02:05:02.830 --> 02:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
entrance would be covered um so it the
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
logistics of individuals using it um
 
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
could be a little complicated in some
 
02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
could be a little complicated in some
cases

02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes any more questions being
 
02:05:21.310 --> 02:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you and
 
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:24.280 align:start position:0%

yours good
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman and honor
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
honorable me members of the energy and
 
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
natural resources committee for the
 
03:04:45.710 --> 03:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is Carrie gendro District
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
1 Senator thank you for letting me
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
propose a couple of minor changes to RSA
 
03:04:55.710 --> 03:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
227 C colon 122 which is relative to
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
prohibiting metal detecting in certain
 
03:05:00.590 --> 03:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
areas metal detecting has been on the
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
increase and and when it comes to um
 
03:05:05.910 --> 03:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
some exciting discoveries but also it
 
03:05:07.950 --> 03:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
has some challenges and I think this
 
03:05:10.229 --> 03:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
increase has been because of like Oak
 
03:05:13.469 --> 03:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
Island and other people and I think even
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
during covid people were wanting to get
 
03:05:20.269 --> 03:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
outside um but among the list of current
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
places that one can metal detect are
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
athletic fields and school grounds and
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents um from district
 
03:05:30.269 --> 03:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
one had called me and said that on the
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
athletic fields uh metal detectors are
 
03:05:34.830 --> 03:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
digging up they're finding things but
 
03:05:36.110 --> 03:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
they're digging them up but they're not
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
filling in the rivens so he had propo or
 
03:05:43.269 --> 03:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
asked me to um submit this um not to
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
exclude metal detecting but just to
 
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
prohibit it from the uh uh athletic
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
fields and also school grounds the
 
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
results um have been in needless
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
injuries so I'm proposing that we take
 
03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
athletic fields and school grounds off
 
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
the list of places one can metal detect
 
03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
I would also propose that we change the
 
03:06:07.429 --> 03:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
name dumps that's an old word we used to
 
03:06:10.309 --> 03:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
use dumps to the name uh transfer
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
station thank
 
03:06:16.150 --> 03:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
you any questions
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
but repres
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative representative Rong poor
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
question I know you've you've beaten
 
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
Dar several times already and that's
 
03:06:32.070 --> 03:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
amazing you've been practic you've been
 
03:06:34.190 --> 03:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
practicing no I I had my hand up I want
 
03:06:36.990 --> 03:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to the next bill Mr chair just
 
03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
that um go right thank you very much Mr
 
03:06:41.150 --> 03:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you senator for taking
 
03:06:44.229 --> 03:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
my question I actually have two one is
 
03:06:47.110 --> 03:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
um what if someone's um there's a soccer
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
player and let's say a treasured
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
necklace fell off well during a game and
 
03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
would it prohibit her or friends from
 
03:06:57.389 --> 03:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
going out to try to find it on the
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
soccer field that would not prohibit
 
03:07:01.790 --> 03:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
that this is these are folks that are
 
03:07:05.070 --> 03:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
deliberately going out to to dig up um
 
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
treasure that hasn't been found yet so
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
in a case like that I think what you'd
 
03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
find is there'd be a a group of people
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
just going out and looking probably a
 
03:07:15.269 --> 03:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
necklace that was lost during a soccer
 
03:07:18.030 --> 03:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
game would be more on Surface anyway
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
oh CU see these people and then is
 
03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
treasure hunting defined in in that area
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
of Statute that it's a recreational
 
03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
activity that it's not really purposeful
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
to I well I think a lot of people do it
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
for a living too I know um on the Sea
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
Coast a lot of folks will do it for fun
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
but also there's this one gentleman I
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
can't think of his name now I was being
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
told this morning who he was and he
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually goes out to some of the beaches
 
03:07:44.830 --> 03:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
and digs up and he has a website for
 
03:07:50.229 --> 03:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
lost Rings oh wow so so it is I mean
 
03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot to it and a lot of
 
03:07:54.190 --> 03:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
people do it we own some um acreage up
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
in district one and my brother is a huge
 
03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
metal detector um guy and we have some
 
03:08:03.309 --> 03:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
Old Farm sites and seller holes and
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
he'll go around and and dig but there's
 
03:08:08.830 --> 03:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
no danger to anybody like on an athletic
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
field okay and I was um just wondering
 
03:08:17.150 --> 03:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
if it would improve the bill if instead
 
03:08:19.190 --> 03:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
of Del leading athletic fields or school
 
03:08:22.389 --> 03:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
grounds if it's said or otherwise
 
03:08:24.550 --> 03:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited so that it would leave it up
 
03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
to the local control local
 
03:08:28.670 --> 03:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities to decide okay we're
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to not allow it on this school
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
ground or this park because it may even
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
be you know city parks or town Parks
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
people may be doing it and so I'm just
 
03:08:41.070 --> 03:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if if what you would think
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
about that well well if you read the
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill it says on following lands own and
 
03:08:48.469 --> 03:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
control by the state its agencies
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
departments commissions and institutions
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
unless a historic resources and such
 
03:08:56.229 --> 03:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
land has been recorded and restricted as
 
03:08:59.870 --> 03:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
posted I think the way you have it is
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
for just for just on state land correct
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
state or state or or public land
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah yeah so it's defined
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
but it's a good good question it really
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
is a good question leaving it up because
 
03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want government overreach so
 
03:09:18.229 --> 03:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
leaving it up to the m mun
 
03:09:20.670 --> 03:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
alties okay all right thank you yeah
 
03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for the
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
question any other question that
 
03:09:28.510 --> 03:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
second slow
 
03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you senator for taking my
 
03:09:36.030 --> 03:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
question this is actually exactly
 
03:09:38.309 --> 03:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
related to what the chair just mentioned
 
03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
the the um the text of existing statue
 
03:09:44.429 --> 03:09:44.439 align:start position:0%
um says uh following lands owned or
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
controlled by the state but the athletic
 
03:09:49.469 --> 03:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
fields that you're referring to what is
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
an example of an athletic field that's
 
03:09:54.750 --> 03:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
state

03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:09:59.389 --> 03:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
PSU good example
 
03:10:02.670 --> 03:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
PSU so that's an athletic field um any
 
03:10:05.469 --> 03:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
type of college campus that has an
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
athletic field or even state funded I'm
 
03:10:10.830 --> 03:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
trying to think even a in a locally
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
owned municipality where the state would
 
03:10:14.830 --> 03:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
own it I can't think of anything right
 
03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:21.319 align:start position:0%
now but yeah nhti good
 
03:10:24.910 --> 03:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
well yeah good good question I mean
 
03:10:28.990 --> 03:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
actually this as it's written uh I guess
 
03:10:30.590 --> 03:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is the actual law and you're just
 
03:10:32.429 --> 03:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
putting a couple of strike throws and
 
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
changes this is just the law that that
 
03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
says what you can do on public on state
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
land not
 
03:10:47.309 --> 03:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the individual towns I would
 
03:10:51.070 --> 03:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
assum can do it on what can just do it
 
03:10:52.790 --> 03:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:56.389 align:start position:0%
on their own
property

03:10:56.389 --> 03:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr
 
03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you senator for taking my
 
03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
question um it's a would you believe
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there's a series
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
of definitions in
 
03:11:08.550 --> 03:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
227c that defines things like historic
 
03:11:12.349 --> 03:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
property historic resources Etc and I
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
think it's applicable to
 
03:11:16.710 --> 03:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
this it probably answers that some of
 
03:11:19.110 --> 03:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
the other represent have questions thank
 
03:11:21.229 --> 03:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
you representative wolf a
 
03:11:23.349 --> 03:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um school
 
03:11:29.710 --> 03:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
grounds that's a pretty
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
broad area I mean I'm thinking of kage
 
03:11:38.950 --> 03:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
which has 60 Acres out there and people
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
would want to go out
 
03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
and treasure hunt so by I I like what
 
03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
whether it was Senator uh representative
 
03:11:51.710 --> 03:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
Derby or representative run said unless
 
03:11:54.349 --> 03:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise prohibited so the school
 
03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
district could prohibited on their
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
grounds would you be acceptable to an
 
03:12:02.349 --> 03:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
amendment like
 
03:12:05.870 --> 03:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
that okay I'm okay with that
 
03:12:10.030 --> 03:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's if you want to bring it in um it
 
03:12:12.190 --> 03:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
well let's let's go through the
 
03:12:15.070 --> 03:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and and the questioning I
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
think the biggest thing that this
 
03:12:19.389 --> 03:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
constituent was concerned about was and
 
03:12:22.590 --> 03:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
it was specific to the colbrook athletic
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
field and what he found was that the um
 
03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
the participants the those that were on
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
the athletic field whether it's soccer
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
field hockey whatever there were
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
injuries you know I would love to say
 
03:12:36.510 --> 03:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
that those are out those that are out
 
03:12:38.830 --> 03:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
metal detecting that they would do due
 
03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
diligence and cover up the where they've
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
dug but they hadn't been doing that so
 
03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
it has caused injury so that's how this
 
03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
all come about so that we want to be due
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
diligent in um in preventing
 
03:12:52.720 --> 03:12:54.910 align:start position:0%
diligent in um in preventing
injury

03:12:54.910 --> 03:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
injury
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
well representative G and representative
 
03:13:01.870 --> 03:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
I just wonder why a place can't put up a
 
03:13:04.469 --> 03:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
sign that says that they prohibit it
 
03:13:07.269 --> 03:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
like we say no hunting on our property
 
03:13:09.790 --> 03:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
why can't people just do that on their
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
own it's a good question um that would
 
03:13:15.790 --> 03:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
be good if everyone read the signs and
 
03:13:18.429 --> 03:13:18.439 align:start position:0%
Then followed them I agree with you it
 
03:13:20.229 --> 03:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
would be good I think in this case where
 
03:13:23.070 --> 03:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
at school grounds they um probably feel
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
like the public as a tax paay have the
 
03:13:28.510 --> 03:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
right to that property as well they and
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
they do they could go picnic they could
 
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
do whatever but the injuries that occur
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
because of digging up um this through
 
03:13:38.229 --> 03:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
metal detecting um has been
 
03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
problematic thank
 
03:13:42.990 --> 03:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:13:46.030 --> 03:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hoy thank you
 
03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:47.910 align:start position:0%
Hoy thank you
um

03:13:47.910 --> 03:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:50.910 --> 03:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned colbrook I was an NCA
 
03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
referee for several decades and I did a
 
03:13:56.110 --> 03:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
lot of games up in C Brook and I don't
 
03:13:57.870 --> 03:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
think it was the treasure Hunters the
 
03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
field was just freaking
 
03:14:02.950 --> 03:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
horrible simple as that unless they were
 
03:14:07.950 --> 03:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:12.070 --> 03:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
know comment any other questions members
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh well I just have
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
something to say somebody who
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
has done this for
 
03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
recreationally there is some certain
 
03:14:24.910 --> 03:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
Unwritten rules and
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes we live in a society right now
 
03:14:30.269 --> 03:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
that people don't give a rats about
 
03:14:33.910 --> 03:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
anything and about it's all about me
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
well they don't some people just are
 
03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
plain old-fashioned rout and sometimes
 
03:14:42.309 --> 03:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
you have to put something in law just to
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
try to put uh put some put some on it I
 
03:14:48.389 --> 03:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
wish there was something I don't know
 
03:14:52.670 --> 03:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
maybe there hopefully there is uh that
 
03:14:57.070 --> 03:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh in some other part of this of the uh
 
03:14:59.830 --> 03:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the of the statute that speaks about
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
some kind of punishment for that because
 
03:15:06.750 --> 03:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
for those of us who do it we we use our
 
03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
heads and we Pat it down because we know
 
03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
we're on somebody else's property right
 
03:15:16.630 --> 03:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
so right but I I think what the way this
 
03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:18.670 align:start position:0%
so right but I I think what the way this
read

03:15:18.670 --> 03:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
read
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
this is this is where where people can
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
go now and we're just scratching out
 
03:15:28.110 --> 03:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
certain things on state land they cannot
 
03:15:30.990 --> 03:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
do they can still do it on beaches they
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
can do it on perimeters of SE of
 
03:15:36.630 --> 03:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
cemeteries unpaved roads but this is
 
03:15:40.469 --> 03:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
says no you can't go there now and it's
 
03:15:42.790 --> 03:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but that's sometimes you got
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
to say okay we got to just say no you
 
03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
can't do it so yeah
 
03:15:53.469 --> 03:15:53.479 align:start position:0%
I I agree with what's in the
 
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill representative Rome so I have a
 
03:15:59.550 --> 03:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
little confusion because it does say
 
03:16:01.710 --> 03:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
Exempted so treasure hunting with metal
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
detectors and dowsing rods is Exempted
 
03:16:07.550 --> 03:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
from the restrictions of the subdivision
 
03:16:09.510 --> 03:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
on the following lands owned or
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
controlled by the state so senator in in
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
with your constituents concerned that's
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
not state-owned land is it it's local
 
03:16:19.630 --> 03:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a mun School District own
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
land School District correct so this
 
03:16:24.510 --> 03:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't help that problem because this
 
03:16:27.189 --> 03:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
only applies to state land you know like
 
03:16:28.830 --> 03:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
a school grounds or athletic fields that
 
03:16:30.870 --> 03:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
are owned by the state so we'd have to
 
03:16:34.469 --> 03:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
put in something that encompasses
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
municipality if you want it to yeah I
 
03:16:38.950 --> 03:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
this I don't know have not looked at the
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh at the rest of the the the law I mean
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it right now uh
 
03:16:52.710 --> 03:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative M uh is there anything in
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
it for other than the state or is this
 
03:16:57.990 --> 03:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
only on state property is that that
 
03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
section of that law I may you may it may
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
be too so too big to read everything
 
03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
through it is there anything on in other
 
03:17:09.429 --> 03:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
sections so as so as I read it m Mr Mr
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
chairman there's a large section of
 
03:17:14.910 --> 03:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
definitions under 227
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
C1 uh that defin commissioner council
 
03:17:19.750 --> 03:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
department historic preservation
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
historic property historic
 
03:17:25.469 --> 03:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
resource uh the historic property is
 
03:17:26.990 --> 03:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
anything that's been listed in the
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
historic register of uh register of
 
03:17:29.520 --> 03:17:31.870 align:start position:0%
historic register of uh register of
historic

03:17:31.870 --> 03:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
historic
 
03:17:34.990 --> 03:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
places uh any object or group of objects
 
03:17:38.990 --> 03:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
associated with historic properties etc
 
03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
associated with historic properties etc
etc

03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.110 --> 03:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:56.030 --> 03:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
and so for us to do anything beyond the
 
03:17:58.950 --> 03:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
scope here would require
 
03:17:58.960 --> 03:18:01.189 align:start position:0%
scope here would require
additional

03:18:01.189 --> 03:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
research I mean Tre treasure hunting
 
03:18:05.710 --> 03:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
isn't further
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
defined to representative rang's point
 
03:18:11.790 --> 03:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not my opinion is I'm not sure needs
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be defined I mean it talks about the
 
03:18:16.269 --> 03:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
the current statute talks about treasure
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
hunting with metal detectors and dowsing
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
rods I'm not sure how we'd further
 
03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
rods I'm not sure how we'd further
Define

03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
Define
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
it we
 
03:18:24.239 --> 03:18:27.790 align:start position:0%
it we
could

03:18:27.790 --> 03:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:30.150 --> 03:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
um there's another question while you're
 
03:18:32.429 --> 03:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
while you're looking for anything else
 
03:18:34.550 --> 03:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative Derby thank you Mr
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
chair this just to your point entire the
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
entire 227c talks about state land and
 
03:18:41.950 --> 03:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
state controlled resources I think that
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
you're correct that if we wanted to do
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
provide the ability presuming it's not
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
already there for municipalities to set
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
these regulations that would have to go
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
in a different part of
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
Statute so okay thank you yeah
 
03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
so so we would so so so to meet the
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
thing meet the issue around local
 
03:19:06.030 --> 03:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
schools that would have to be some other
 
03:19:11.229 --> 03:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
but if I don't know uh where where do we
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
want to go from here I mean I I just
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
assumed past this right now but but
 
03:19:26.110 --> 03:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm missing my my uh
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
ranking well let's take uh why don't we
 
03:19:36.429 --> 03:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
well let's we still got a few minutes uh
 
03:19:39.710 --> 03:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
if we can uh wait for anyone else to
 
03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
show up but I don't know if uh anyone is
 
03:19:46.189 --> 03:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
going to show up uh representative
 
03:19:46.199 --> 03:19:47.510 align:start position:0%
going to show up uh representative
representative

03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:19:48.830 --> 03:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
I just have one other comment thank you
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I do I'm slightly concerned
 
03:19:54.670 --> 03:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
about the lack of definition of treasure
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
hunting esec especially with respect to
 
03:19:59.630 --> 03:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative Run's question about
 
03:20:02.349 --> 03:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
somebody that may have lost jewelry and
 
03:20:04.790 --> 03:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
be searching for the jewelry and I think
 
03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
the treasure hunting needs to be um
 
03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
needs to be a bit more carefully defined
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
but otherwise I think that the bill
 
03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense especially because of um as
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
people pointed out to me um you know the
 
03:20:19.910 --> 03:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
state-owned athletic fields that we
 
03:20:25.349 --> 03:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:28.110 --> 03:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair I'd be happy to work on an
 
03:20:30.830 --> 03:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that defines treasure hunting
 
03:20:32.550 --> 03:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
and metal detecting because I see
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
treasure hunting is the disturbance of
 
03:20:34.479 --> 03:20:35.229 align:start position:0%
treasure hunting is the disturbance of
the

03:20:35.229 --> 03:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:37.510 --> 03:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
surface and I think that's the big
 
03:20:39.790 --> 03:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
problem here is the disturbing this
 
03:20:41.910 --> 03:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
because I could look at this treasure
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
hunting and it could be the example of a
 
03:20:47.630 --> 03:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
young athlete that lost a a NE neace cuz
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
that's a treasure you're hunting for it
 
03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
um but that's not what the senator is
 
03:20:54.910 --> 03:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
talking about she's talking about
 
03:20:57.229 --> 03:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
disturbing the surface and creating
 
03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
damage and I think that behavior needs
 
03:21:01.710 --> 03:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
to have a different definition than
 
03:21:06.269 --> 03:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
something I mean it's just a matter of
 
03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
putting in here you don't have to
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily even Define treasure hunting
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
but just say something like is if you're
 
03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
digging below the
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
surface right disturbing disturbance
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
yeah surface disturbance yeah there you
 
03:21:24.750 --> 03:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.870 --> 03:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
in but it's still I mean just so we know
 
03:21:29.950 --> 03:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
that it this is still not solving
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
Senator constituents problem because
 
03:21:36.269 --> 03:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
that's not state owned land right that
 
03:21:39.150 --> 03:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
would probably if it
 
03:21:43.309 --> 03:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
exists if probably ex exists in other
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
other statutes where somebody is
 
03:21:46.080 --> 03:21:47.229 align:start position:0%
other statutes where somebody is
basically

03:21:47.229 --> 03:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:21:49.710 --> 03:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
trespassing and doing and actually
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
damaging the the property right that's a
 
03:21:56.349 --> 03:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's a m that's a
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief if nothing else the
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
school defines the rules they prohibit
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
dogs for instance so yeah I mean there
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.070 --> 03:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
be uh more point of clarification too
 
03:22:19.229 --> 03:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
if with Senator Harvey Bully's
 
03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion which I think is excellent we
 
03:22:23.550 --> 03:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
would want that to apply to everything
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
so if they are disturbing the surface of
 
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
the beach they should repair that they
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
should fill that back in with sand or if
 
03:22:31.309 --> 03:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
they're on an unpaved Road and they're
 
03:22:33.229 --> 03:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
digging a hole that's still going to
 
03:22:36.630 --> 03:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
cause a hazard they should fill that
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
in yeah well let's that we have a nice
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
easy Bill let's not get it to the point
 
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
that somebody's got a lot of work to do
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of work to do you know
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
you just haven't heard for the last
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
three bills you you've got an idea on
 
03:22:55.110 --> 03:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
everyone guess
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
what representative har then
 
03:22:59.950 --> 03:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you senator for
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
taking this question it's a tradeoff of
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
Representative rang I think she
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned a point of order but I would
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
like to know your opinion you now know
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill as you propos only
 
03:23:12.550 --> 03:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
relates to State Property you still in
 
03:23:14.910 --> 03:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
favor of your bills very much so and I
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
think what I'm I'm probably stretching
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
it a little bit further but I think even
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
that taking the school in colbrook if
 
03:23:22.950 --> 03:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
they're receiving State funds um with
 
03:23:24.510 --> 03:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
that and it's probably a stretch but
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
would that still be considered um State
 
03:23:30.429 --> 03:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
Property no
 
03:23:33.189 --> 03:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
welcome representative wolf thank you
 
03:23:39.429 --> 03:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I think
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's so
 
03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
many unanswered questions in here as to
 
03:23:47.070 --> 03:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
you know digging up the the beach and
 
03:23:49.590 --> 03:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
things like that I think the bill almost
 
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
ought to start all over again with a
 
03:23:52.080 --> 03:23:53.309 align:start position:0%
ought to start all over again with a
complete

03:23:53.309 --> 03:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
complete
 
03:23:56.229 --> 03:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
cleanup I hate to say that to you
 
03:23:59.429 --> 03:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
Senator but we're dancing around the
 
03:24:03.150 --> 03:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
horn here and I think if you want a full
 
03:24:06.510 --> 03:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that may be the way to go simp
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
folks maybe it's me but somebody drove
 
03:24:12.910 --> 03:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
in to get a g gallon of gas and now you
 
03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
want to rebuild the
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
car I me
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
No I gave them the gallon of gas and a
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
can and sent them on their way yeah but
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
she haven't we haven't done the bill
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
yet I mean you want to
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
change you want you want to or what do
 
03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
do do you w to I I think I think the
 
03:24:42.269 --> 03:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
bill is going to be so amended that we
 
03:24:45.070 --> 03:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
ought to start with a whole new bill or
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
make one amendment that change ches
 
03:24:49.630 --> 03:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
everything down through there well
 
03:24:52.150 --> 03:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
there's no what do you need is an
 
03:24:55.229 --> 03:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
amendment other than a change in maybe
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
in what treasure hunting is well I I
 
03:25:01.150 --> 03:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
first of all there's two points here one
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
is to we we see that there's some
 
03:25:06.550 --> 03:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
shortcomings with the bill lack of
 
03:25:09.269 --> 03:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
definition of treasure hunting you know
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
damage to those other things that are
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
still allowed it still doesn't solve the
 
03:25:17.229 --> 03:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
constituent issue so there is a
 
03:25:19.830 --> 03:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
possibility we could just itl it and
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
people that have an interest in this
 
03:25:25.870 --> 03:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
area can bring a new bill back in the
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
fall I mean I don't I think schools can
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
can make their own laws about yeah
 
03:25:36.750 --> 03:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
well where are
 
03:25:39.309 --> 03:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
going I don't believe
 
03:25:43.030 --> 03:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
this I mean somebody comes in with a a
 
03:25:45.790 --> 03:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
five minute Bill and all of a sudden
 
03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:47.229 align:start position:0%
five minute Bill and all of a sudden
it's

03:25:47.229 --> 03:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
we have to do the Magna
 
03:25:51.950 --> 03:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
Carta give me a
 
03:25:55.950 --> 03:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
break am I in another room Another
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
Universe good Lord the world upside down
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
help me out here Mr chairman another
 
03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
another another
 
03:26:05.710 --> 03:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
possibility another possibility to take
 
03:26:07.630 --> 03:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
the opposite view of my friend and
 
03:26:10.710 --> 03:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative rung is we just pass the
 
03:26:13.070 --> 03:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
bill as suggested then come back next
 
03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
year with another bill uh what I would
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
like to know as a lawyer and A
 
03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
legislature is how long has this bill
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
been in effect that nobody's brought up
 
03:26:23.910 --> 03:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
the issue of what is treasure hunting if
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
we've live with this bill for 50 years
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not too concerned to not pass what
 
03:26:31.950 --> 03:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
the senator would like for a definition
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
that nobody's questioned for 50 years
 
03:26:37.469 --> 03:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
and we always have in the law the little
 
03:26:39.990 --> 03:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
subnote that most people don't read if
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's not defined in the statute go to
 
03:26:45.309 --> 03:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
Webster's Dictionary it's in there
 
03:26:47.910 --> 03:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
usually we do that in all the bylaws and
 
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
regulations locally because you can't
 
03:26:53.710 --> 03:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
Define everything so I'll bet dollars to
 
03:26:55.550 --> 03:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
Donuts I might even buy everybody a cup
 
03:26:58.229 --> 03:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
of coffee Webster's Dictionary will
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
Define treasure hunting so I think we're
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay with that I'm not opposed but now
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we're getting into discussion
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
sit you haven't spoken for the first
 
03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:13.950 align:start position:0%
sit you haven't spoken for the first
time

03:27:13.950 --> 03:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
re oh thank you Mr chair I feel like
 
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
we've gone into an executive session and
 
03:27:20.830 --> 03:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
I would like
 
03:27:25.150 --> 03:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
to not do that okay well was this only
 
03:27:27.429 --> 03:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
brought this up is because we were there
 
03:27:29.389 --> 03:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
was a possibility of being able to
 
03:27:31.189 --> 03:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
execute right now but I don't think
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen and then we're
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to go to a 101 on
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
03:27:41.150 --> 03:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay I I just want to U thank you Mr
 
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:42.560 align:start position:0%

line on that bill the last time it was
 
03:27:51.389 --> 03:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
amended was in 2003 and this was not
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
changed then the previous time was 1985
 
03:27:55.870 --> 03:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the history so it's
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
been a long time to your point I agree
 
03:28:02.189 --> 03:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%

defines treasure hunting as an act of
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%

Conway um I appear before you here today
 
03:48:11.229 --> 03:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor of Senate Bill
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
192 the intent of this bill is to remove
 
03:48:17.389 --> 03:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
one single word from the RSA
 
03:48:20.670 --> 03:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
486 the word intercepting is not clearly
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
defined and because of this confusion
 
03:48:26.070 --> 03:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
the statute is not consistently in
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
interpreted this misinterpretation is
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
causing municipalities to have
 
03:48:33.389 --> 03:48:33.399 align:start position:0%
difficulties uh
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
estimating what portion of their sewer
 
03:48:38.349 --> 03:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects are eligible for
 
03:48:39.910 --> 03:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
the state aid
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
grants deleting the word interception
 
03:48:46.349 --> 03:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
will clarify the definition and the
 
03:48:49.710 --> 03:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the statute and ensure
 
03:48:52.189 --> 03:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
that all sewers qualify for the state
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
aid grants therefore I request that you

03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
from sewers for the purposes of applying
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
for and distributing state aid grants
 
03:50:05.309 --> 03:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
03:50:07.790 --> 03:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
486 why is this
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
important I've been in I can't believe
 
03:50:13.269 --> 03:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
this 30 years I've been doing this and
 
03:50:16.110 --> 03:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
back in the day um as a young engineer
 
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
we used to try to Define all the
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
different types of sewers we would have
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
trunk sewers we'd have intercepting
 
03:50:23.189 --> 03:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
sewers we would have collector sewers
 
03:50:24.990 --> 03:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
and they all try to have a specific
 
03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
meaning the problem is is in
 
03:50:31.149 --> 03:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
application because every Community is a
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
different size so in one Community what
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
you want to call like the main trunk
 
03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
sewer may look a little bit different in
 
03:50:39.870 --> 03:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
a smaller Community like what does it
 
03:50:42.429 --> 03:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
mean in Manchester versus what does it
 
03:50:46.510 --> 03:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
mean in Woodsville right so having that
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
in people's minds swirling around like
 
03:50:49.950 --> 03:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
how what does this intercepting really
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
mean and so by removing the word
 
03:50:55.149 --> 03:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
intercepting we're just saying all
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
public sewers are eligible for state aid
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
grant and that's the intent and that's
 
03:51:04.189 --> 03:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
also how we apply in our clean water srf
 
03:51:07.070 --> 03:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
program is that all public sewers are
 
03:51:09.870 --> 03:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for srf funds whereas private
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
sewers are not so this brings
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
consistency it alleviates that
 
03:51:18.510 --> 03:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
um you know what the trying to figure
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
out what intercepting means and for
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
communities that have to plan their
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
project and they're working out their
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
funding package and what that'll look
 
03:51:31.229 --> 03:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
like and they may be State a grant may
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
be a part of that they're going to want
 
03:51:34.830 --> 03:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
to know what part of their project is
 
03:51:36.670 --> 03:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for state aid grant and what
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
isn't so removing this word will be very
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
helpful it's a simple change but a very
 
03:51:41.640 --> 03:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
helpful it's a simple change but a very
important

03:51:43.510 --> 03:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:51:47.630 --> 03:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
change the next item this bill um does
 
03:51:49.990 --> 03:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
is it raises the fee for wastewater
 
03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:52.349 align:start position:0%
is it raises the fee for wastewater
operator

03:51:52.349 --> 03:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
operator
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
certificates and the fee has been $50
 
03:51:55.680 --> 03:51:57.630 align:start position:0%
certificates and the fee has been $50
since

03:51:57.630 --> 03:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
1996 we have actually had a request from
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
the regulated Community they're willing
 
03:52:06.070 --> 03:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
to increase the fee they want to
 
03:52:08.349 --> 03:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
increase the fee New Hampshire Water
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control Association is
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be submitting a letter of
 
03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
support for this and
 
03:52:16.990 --> 03:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
what this fee is used for well in the
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
RSA where we have this training center
 
03:52:22.110 --> 03:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
in Franklin New Hampshire it's located
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
at the same location as our regional
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility the
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
wbp and this is where we do all the
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
training for the certified Wastewater
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
operators in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
so these monies that are collected are
 
03:52:39.309 --> 03:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to go into this non-lps account
 
03:52:41.269 --> 03:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to pay
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
for a lot of things the upkeep of the
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
train in Center
 
03:52:51.269 --> 03:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
um and basically giving back to the
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
operators so right now we collect
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
$155,000 a year on average we have about
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
600 certified operators in the state and
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
they pay $50 to become a new operator to
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
renew to seek
 
03:53:08.110 --> 03:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and so this would be a
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
doubling of that fee at their request
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
they're looking for this and what
 
03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
they're looking for us is to offer we're
 
03:53:18.469 --> 03:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
in the Dark Ages I have to admit it if
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
you go to the training center we still
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
have an overhead projector you know
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to install new technology
 
03:53:27.149 --> 03:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the times we're asking
 
03:53:29.309 --> 03:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
our operators to operate these
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
multi-million doll facilities and we're
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
using an overhead projector you know
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're demanding more from us and so
 
03:53:40.349 --> 03:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
this increas in fees would be we'd
 
03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
utilize that to give back to the
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
regulated Community um for instance
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes will buy a piece of equipment
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
like a flow meter that can be used at
 
03:53:52.110 --> 03:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
from community community they may just
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
need it for a short period of time and
 
03:53:55.389 --> 03:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
they may not want to invest in that
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment and so we'll purchase
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
it and then we will loan it out to the
 
03:54:02.110 --> 03:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
different communities to use so that's
 
03:54:05.229 --> 03:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
how we use those fees
 
03:54:08.189 --> 03:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
um we just had to replace the cat 6
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
cable at the training center for $10,000
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
don't ask me what it is but it's a cable
 
03:54:15.309 --> 03:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
that's required
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
um and we had to update it so we're
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
seeing increasing costs the training
 
03:54:22.590 --> 03:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
center needs to be updated and we want
 
03:54:26.110 --> 03:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
to respond to our certified operators
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
another thing I can mention is that
 
03:54:30.750 --> 03:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
every for Renewal they have to have 20
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
continuing education units and so that's
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
why we're providing this training is for
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
them to get that and they're also asking
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
that we move from paper tests to online
 
03:54:43.710 --> 03:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
testing and all of these things cost
 
03:54:46.349 --> 03:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
money and want to give it to them but we
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the third thing this bill does is
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
it's another simple change um it
 
03:54:59.950 --> 03:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
changes the the term Consulting
 
03:55:01.790 --> 03:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
Engineers or the phrase Consulting
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
Engineers to Consulting engineering
 
03:55:07.389 --> 03:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
firms so one of the things that we we do
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
per oursa 485 a A3
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
a I'd have to look it's 485a though in
 
03:55:20.429 --> 03:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
that statute we're required to um create
 
03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
a list of pre-qualified engineering
 
03:55:25.790 --> 03:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
firms for in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:55:28.149 --> 03:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
and so basically any licensed
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
engineering firm who wants to be on the
 
03:55:33.550 --> 03:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
list um submits an application they get
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
on the list right now we have 51 firms
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
on that list it's a longstanding list um
 
03:55:42.269 --> 03:55:42.279 align:start position:0%
we're about to update we're in the
 
03:55:45.550 --> 03:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
process of updating the rules e and
 
03:55:47.950 --> 03:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
vc500 um and in
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
that we actually had two categories we
 
03:55:54.670 --> 03:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
had you could be an individual applicant
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
which didn't even make sense I don't I
 
03:55:59.110 --> 03:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't know why any why that was even in
 
03:56:01.389 --> 03:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
there we're not in the business of
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
creating a list of
 
03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
individual licensed engineers in the
 
03:56:08.670 --> 03:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
state I'm a PE in the
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
state I am certified through the New
 
03:56:12.239 --> 03:56:13.229 align:start position:0%
state I am certified through the New
Hampshire

03:56:13.229 --> 03:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
oplc why would New Hampshire Dees keep a
 
03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
list of IND individual firms it just
 
03:56:20.830 --> 03:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense so anyways we're
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
moving away we're taking that out we
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone on the list that was
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
an an individual because the purpose of
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
that list is we have four categories and
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose is for municipalities to be
 
03:56:36.149 --> 03:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
able to go to that list and say oh okay
 
03:56:38.349 --> 03:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
what what engineering firms in the state
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
are qualified to do major Wastewater
 
03:56:44.590 --> 03:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure work or major water
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
distribution work and so communities can
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
use that list to hire firms that we have
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
pre-qualified so REM so basically
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
changing Consulting Engineers to
 
03:56:58.750 --> 03:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
Consulting to Consulting engineering
 
03:57:02.149 --> 03:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
firms just solidifies that we're not
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
there to create a list of Consulting
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
Engineers like I could be a Consulting
 
03:57:09.070 --> 03:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
engineer as an individual we're there to
 
03:57:12.510 --> 03:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
create a list of Consulting engineering
 
03:57:16.429 --> 03:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
firms so that concludes my testimony if
 
03:57:20.830 --> 03:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
answer representative
 
03:57:26.790 --> 03:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
heart them all
 
03:57:30.630 --> 03:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
out I want to Star for this Mr chair uh
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question as a
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
sole practitioner I'm concerned about
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
taking out Consulting Engineers because
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have a firm if I'm
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
pre-qualified and I meet your
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications for this I can see people
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
looking at your website to perhaps find
 
03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
somebody locally that can help them now
 
03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be cut off your website
 
03:57:55.950 --> 03:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a firm so why wouldn't
 
03:57:58.590 --> 03:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
you do both if you want to and and not
 
03:58:02.189 --> 03:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
throw out the individual engineer what I
 
03:58:05.229 --> 03:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
can say is you're not on our list right
 
03:58:08.030 --> 03:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
now we don't have a list of individual
 
03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
Engineers that's what oplc does so you
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
can go on to that website and you can
 
03:58:14.990 --> 03:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
look me up on that that website and you
 
03:58:16.830 --> 03:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
can find my license number and see that
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm certified to do work in New
 
03:58:20.790 --> 03:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this does not mean you can't
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
do work in New
 
03:58:25.429 --> 03:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a list of pre-qualified
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
licensed engineering firms
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
so if you're a firm Are you a
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
firm I would say if you're a sole
 
03:58:37.030 --> 03:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
practitioner or engineer you're not a
 
03:58:39.950 --> 03:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
firm right exactly so you you can do
 
03:58:41.550 --> 03:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire this does not
 
03:58:43.149 --> 03:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
preclude you from doing work in New
 
03:58:46.110 --> 03:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is specifically for
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
licensed engineering firms who and what
 
03:58:50.670 --> 03:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is provide this
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
listed communities that are doing
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar projects that are
 
03:58:58.469 --> 03:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
looking for firms that have the
 
03:59:01.349 --> 03:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
capabilities to do that work you know
 
03:59:03.790 --> 03:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
because my in my Bureau we oversee the
 
03:59:06.189 --> 03:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
Clean Water srf program so we provide
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
the funding for the Wastewater infrastru
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
I should say clean water infrastructure
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
projects in the state because we do
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and storm water so this does
 
03:59:16.910 --> 03:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
not preclude you from doing work in the
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
03:59:20.550 --> 03:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's just you're not on that
 
03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:22.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's just you're not on that
particular

03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
list follow followup you may have
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
answered this but at this time you have
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
no individual
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
Consulting thank you at at this thank
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking the followup at this time
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
you have no individual Consulting
 
03:59:40.750 --> 03:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
Engineers on your list of preapproved
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
firms or pre-approved people correct we
 
03:59:46.389 --> 03:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
do not and that's why it's made the the
 
03:59:48.469 --> 03:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
transition and the rules it's making it
 
03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
easier because we're not cutting anyone
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
off that was historically on the list
 
03:59:56.110 --> 03:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby for a question
 
04:00:01.149 --> 04:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:00:04.750 --> 04:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
my question um with respect to the
 
04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
intercepting term um do I understand
 
04:00:11.110 --> 04:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
that the the state aid grant already in
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
um includes all public sewers and so the
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
correct for a followup thank you Mr
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
chair for the followup thank you again
 
04:00:26.389 --> 04:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
um there's a part of this bill which
 
04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
eliminates the fines and late fee the
 
04:00:33.910 --> 04:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
late fees um that that you know there's
 
04:00:35.950 --> 04:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
no compensation for those late fees so
 
04:00:37.269 --> 04:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
are those something that the department
 
04:00:39.750 --> 04:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
regularly collects um is there any
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
concern about delinquent municipalities
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh um paying you know missing those late
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
fees and is there any enforcement
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
required in order to make sure that
 
04:00:51.469 --> 04:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
people the the fees are
 
04:00:55.269 --> 04:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
paid um so the late fee just going to
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
pull that
 
04:00:56.399 --> 04:00:58.710 align:start position:0%
pull that
out

04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
is this is for the the cert wastewater
 
04:01:02.080 --> 04:01:04.030 align:start position:0%
is this is for the the cert wastewater
operator

04:01:04.030 --> 04:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
operator
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
certification it it it this has been an
 
04:01:10.590 --> 04:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
awkward statement for us and it's
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
conflicting we've had several
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
conversations with the lawyers
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
is like if I'll go by my experience as
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
an engineer right every two years I have
 
04:01:23.710 --> 04:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
to renew my PE license and I have to
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
submit my cus and my fee and I have to
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
do that by a certain date if I don't do
 
04:01:32.189 --> 04:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
that by a certain date I no longer have
 
04:01:35.429 --> 04:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
my license and so that's the same thing
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
here is like if you're a certified
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
wastewater operator and you have a
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
2-year license and it expires on a
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
certain date and you don't submit your
 
04:01:48.030 --> 04:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
renewal application in your fee you're
 
04:01:50.189 --> 04:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
no longer certified so we're trying to
 
04:01:53.149 --> 04:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
be consistent with what other agency
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
across the state are doing plus we want
 
04:01:58.389 --> 04:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
everyone just to submit on time we don't
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
want to be in the business of collecting
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
late fees and so we actually have a very
 
04:02:05.550 --> 04:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
robust program of notifying people hey
 
04:02:08.070 --> 04:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
your license is going to expire hey did
 
04:02:10.269 --> 04:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
you forget your license is about to
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
expire and so we're really working on
 
04:02:18.269 --> 04:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:20.670 --> 04:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
fees any other
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
questions M of the committee being none
 
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
you honorable Mr
 
04:02:42.510 --> 04:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
chello Mr chairman I made a mistake I'm
 
04:02:46.349 --> 04:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
going to speak on oh 589 I oh I'm sorry
 
04:02:49.469 --> 04:02:49.479 align:start position:0%
I apologize you know you no um I got the
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.319 --> 04:03:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
left

04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%

first
 
04:03:24.790 --> 04:03:24.800 align:start position:0%

touched on a lot of the main points uh
 
04:04:06.670 --> 04:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
in my testimony so uh Senate Bill 492
 
04:04:09.469 --> 04:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
clarifies the following purposes uh of
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
making consistent RSA 486 uh clearly
 
04:04:15.149 --> 04:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
defined so that that it can be applied
 
04:04:17.790 --> 04:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
in a consistent manner uh first the bill
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
addresses the clarification of the term
 
04:04:21.429 --> 04:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
intercept Interceptor
 
04:04:24.269 --> 04:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
sewer uh second uh the bill addresses
 
04:04:26.590 --> 04:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater operators uh
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
certification fee and lastly SP 492
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
addresses clarification for the term uh
 
04:04:34.950 --> 04:04:34.960 align:start position:0%

chairman uh my name is Bill Hansel it's
 
04:05:09.149 --> 04:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
been quite a while since I've testified
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
before you uh I was in your seat for in
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
84 82
 
04:05:19.229 --> 04:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
87 uh I'm representing Granite State
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
Rural Water
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
Association North Conway water Precinct
 
04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
and low Bartlett water Precinct two
 
04:05:29.630 --> 04:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
precincts in Mount Washington
 
04:05:34.149 --> 04:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
Valley this bill Uh clarifies u a lot of
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
U what this program is all about uh the
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
grant state aid grant on funding Water
 
04:05:41.309 --> 04:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
and Wastewater projects this particular
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
one has to do with Wastewater
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 2 last session uh added uh
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
Cav caveat that municipalities that
 
04:05:56.110 --> 04:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
finished their project had one year of
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
warranty uh that went by
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
before uh the state would start making
 
04:06:05.229 --> 04:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
the payments uh in other words the
 
04:06:07.229 --> 04:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
budget's already there with the money
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
but it has to go to governor councel for
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
final approval and it won't go there
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
until the oneyear warranty during that
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
one-year warranty house bill to said you
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
have that year to get your application
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
in for certification for
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
payment the certification for payment
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
can't go in from a municipality until
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
final completion all this is overseen by
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
04:06:34.510 --> 04:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
so it's critically important now for you
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
to consider that um the backlog of
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
getting those applications in is
 
04:06:42.510 --> 04:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat confusing by this one word
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
interceptor so taking that out just
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
clarifies it and allows municipalities
 
04:06:49.950 --> 04:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
to not have to go through some much
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
cumbersome paperwork and also helps us
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
the dees engineering Bureau do the same
 
04:06:58.590 --> 04:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh so really will expedite that
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
application process and allow it to fall
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
in the rhythm of the one-year warranty
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
period then as soon as the warrant is up
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
the application of all darn certific it
 
04:07:10.110 --> 04:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
can go to government Council because
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
this this program pays uh 20 20 to 30%
 
04:07:17.469 --> 04:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
of annual principal interest payments on
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
the municipal bond to build these
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant uh right now there's
 
04:07:23.760 --> 04:07:25.229 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant uh right now there's
about

04:07:25.229 --> 04:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:07:29.710 --> 04:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
U uh say it's averaging 25% some some
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
some get 10 some if you have stress
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
rates you get an extra 10 which is 30
 
04:07:38.070 --> 04:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
that that is $15 million here that's
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
already in the budget so the money is
 
04:07:41.229 --> 04:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
there for the
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
program but the money it can't be
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
distributed until the certification for
 
04:07:48.309 --> 04:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
payments so the Rhythm the rhythm of it
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
has to match that and oddly enough the
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
first Bond payment from the Federal
 
04:07:56.429 --> 04:07:56.439 align:start position:0%
loans which a lot of them get rural
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
development loans and grants the the
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
First Federal Loan payment is done just
 
04:08:05.950 --> 04:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
about one year after and so the first
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
payment for the state their portion
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
would fall into line with that and it
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
would help uh Leverage that right now
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's 15 million a year leverage it's
 
04:08:19.710 --> 04:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
leveraging $600 million of already
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
completed Wastewater infrastructure so
 
04:08:25.630 --> 04:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
you can see the tremendous uh capacity
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
it has to make this affordable at the
 
04:08:30.910 --> 04:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
municipal level so it's very critical to
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
get this word out of there make it clear
 
04:08:35.550 --> 04:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
so especially from the municipal point
 
04:08:37.469 --> 04:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
of view of passing bonds to build these
 
04:08:41.229 --> 04:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
Wastewater uh projects it it makes it
 
04:08:43.229 --> 04:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
more understandable for the for the
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
people people in the municipalities that
 
04:08:47.550 --> 04:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
are going to vote on those bonds and
 
04:08:51.149 --> 04:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
makes it very uh reliable that the
 
04:08:53.790 --> 04:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
programs there to help fund monies in
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
the budget this will clarify the process
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
for application so that's a bit of a
 
04:08:59.040 --> 04:09:01.469 align:start position:0%
for application so that's a bit of a
detailed

04:09:01.469 --> 04:09:01.479 align:start position:0%
detailed
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
explanation and and from a municipal
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
point of view we're we're all for
 
04:09:08.349 --> 04:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
raising the fee for to help oversee the
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
licensing and the engineering firms are
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
glad to see the engineering firms
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
you know certified by the dees if you
 
04:09:19.469 --> 04:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
look at the statute it says the dees
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
overseas is is to help the
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and it oversees it every
 
04:09:26.429 --> 04:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
step of the way they oversee all of the
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
invoices they oversee the
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
preconstruction meetings of uh final
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
completion substantial completion final
 
04:09:37.070 --> 04:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
completion retainage so that they they
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
hand carry you through with the with the
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
engineering firm that the municipality
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
hires there was quite a team effort and
 
04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
those M those engineering firms goes
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
through request or proposal by the
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
municipality a selected by the
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
municipality approved by the DS but they
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
can also team those firms can Team
 
04:10:00.910 --> 04:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
within any individual Engineers they
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
want to make the team they present to to
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
the community to to be selected so it's
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't lock anybody builds a better
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
team uh there's quite a lot of knowledge
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
needed to build Wastewater facility more
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
controls and piping and all that goes
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
into it so it takes a takes a pretty
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
good uh combination of Engineers working
 
04:10:26.229 --> 04:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
together to to get it done so I we
 
04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities very much in support
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
that there any questions by uh members
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.119 --> 04:10:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
much

04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:10:42.239 --> 04:10:49.950 align:start position:0%
much
see

04:10:49.950 --> 04:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
I see no other P
 
04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:10:59.070 --> 04:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
no I will close the
 
04:11:05.479 --> 04:11:06.990 align:start position:0%
no I will close the
hearing

04:11:06.990 --> 04:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:11:12.349 --> 04:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
hey uh there this bill has a fee on it
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not a and I think I'm going to say
 
04:11:19.710 --> 04:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
no I would not we still have two uh we
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
have two weeks to take care of
 
04:11:25.710 --> 04:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
it so uh I'm not going to ex I I will
 
04:11:29.149 --> 04:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
not move to execut
 
04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
now I think I want to it's an election
 
04:11:32.960 --> 04:11:34.189 align:start position:0%
now I think I want to it's an election
year

04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.030 --> 04:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
fees that with but then again I'm not
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.030 --> 04:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh we will the next hearing is
 
04:11:50.040 --> 04:12:12.149 align:start position:0%
uh we will the next hearing is
at

04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:12.159 --> 04:12:42.109 align:start position:0%

uh thanks Mr chairman Senator David
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
Waters District 4 and I'm here on behalf
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
of Senator dallis sander who couldn't uh
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today to introduce
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 549 relative procedures for
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
inspection and transfer of dams and
 
04:31:22.710 --> 04:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
alternatives for funding and and so
 
04:31:27.109 --> 04:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
forth um this bill comes to you
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously through the uh Senate I'll
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
just give a little background I know we
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
have uh Corey Clark here from the dam
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau to talk a little bit more on
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
details about the current
 
04:31:38.590 --> 04:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
situation um we
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
do nhdes is responsible for
 
04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
reconstruction Rehabilitation of some
 
04:31:48.189 --> 04:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
273 state-owned dams and they operate uh
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
28 of those dams um think of the some of
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
the big lakes uh winaki winnisquam Squam
 
04:31:57.389 --> 04:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
Newfound sopy uh
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
oapi and uh currently um Dees in the
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
process of evaluating the systemwide
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
needs of New Hampshire's state-owned
 
04:32:07.149 --> 04:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
dams and categorizing those dams by
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
their um purpose and needs and they have
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
really discovered um how much there are
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
increasing Capital needs like everything
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
else the uh increase in in costs and uh
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
that operational cost these dams is
 
04:32:22.469 --> 04:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
starting to outpace the funding sources
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
and the resources that we have um for
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
them um so that's why the bill comes
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
forward particularly in the study
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
committee part of it to look at uh to
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
evaluate these Financial read needs and
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
to see if there are potentially other
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources now historically um this
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
this effort has been funded by revenue
 
04:32:47.950 --> 04:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
generated from leasing state owned
 
04:32:50.910 --> 04:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
hydropower uh dams um but these revenue
 
04:32:55.109 --> 04:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
streams have decreased um result because
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
of a lot of factors outside of
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
Dees uh controls so um what this will do
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
is give us a mechanism to evaluate the
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
current funding sources the possibility
 
04:33:07.429 --> 04:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
of other um funding sources to keep the
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
dam Bureau financially um liable and
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
then I think import importantly in this
 
04:33:14.910 --> 04:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
effort you'll see on the first uh
 
04:33:19.390 --> 04:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
section of the bill um lines 8 through
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh 11 and then a couple language you
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
know kind of little tweaks to the
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
language after that but that first part
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
um is going to be important in terms of
 
04:33:32.910 --> 04:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
um clarifying the kinds of uh uh the
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
kinds of um non- Menace dams and uh how
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
the dam Bureau can reclassify non--
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
Manis Dam to a higher classification
 
04:33:43.590 --> 04:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
based and the amount of water that Dam
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
can discharge so that's that's why you
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
see lines 8 to 11 there and that that is
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
really a kind of a basic inspection and
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
safety issue part of the part of the
 
04:33:58.510 --> 04:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
bill um Mr chairman I would be happy to
 
04:34:00.269 --> 04:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
answer questions but I think you're
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
going to get correct answers from the
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.719 --> 04:34:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
up

04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:29.400 --> 04:34:30.949 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh chairman uh steam
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
members um I was also notified that uh
 
04:34:39.629 --> 04:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Lou wouldn't be here today so I
 
04:34:43.109 --> 04:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
came in just in case um as you will see
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a uh for the record Mark
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
mcon I represent the good people of uh
 
04:34:51.150 --> 04:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
Carroll County District dat i chair
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways and on the U
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
odd years our charge is the capital
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
budget and uh funding for the dam
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
Authority or the dams comes through
 
04:35:06.349 --> 04:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget so I believe that's why
 
04:35:08.349 --> 04:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
um the Senate was anxious to bring
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
myself and representative cluder into
 
04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
this bill uh because we are typically
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
the ones that have handled this over the
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
past 20 years my only concern over the
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
whole bill is is the quick reporting
 
04:35:23.150 --> 04:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
time which is November 1st of
 
04:35:27.070 --> 04:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
2024 um and I know in commissions that
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
we've all been a part of um especially
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to do fund
 
04:35:35.949 --> 04:35:35.959 align:start position:0%
tolling or roads going forward we found
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
a need for a longer term uh but I would
 
04:35:42.750 --> 04:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
leave that to the Senator's request um I
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
myself uh am in favor of the legislation
 
04:35:54.390 --> 04:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:10.029 --> 04:36:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon chairman members of
 
04:36:14.670 --> 04:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Corey Clark chief
 
04:36:16.510 --> 04:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
engineer at the dam Bureau at the New
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
Services and um one thing I do want to
 
04:36:23.310 --> 04:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
mention is that this the language in
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
this uh s SP 549 is very similar to the
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
bill that was before you previously HB
 
04:36:33.629 --> 04:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
1277 um but basically because there was
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
a dueling Bills going on this committee
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh voted to itl that bill and so that's
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
why we're looking at sp sp 549
 
04:36:46.590 --> 04:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
now and so uh just to uh go over some of
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
the things that uh Senator Waters
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned State of New
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have 273 state-owned dams
 
04:36:57.150 --> 04:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
we operate roughly 208 of those dams and
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
given the capital needs of of all those
 
04:37:02.910 --> 04:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
structures we we looked at last about a
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
year ago what what would it take to
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
actually repair all those structures
 
04:37:08.590 --> 04:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at roughly about $414
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
million the capital needs to repair all
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
those 2 73 state-owned dams and when we
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
look at just the 63 High Hazard dams out
 
04:37:18.109 --> 04:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
of that list we're looking at roughly
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
about $300 million to re rehabilitate
 
04:37:22.750 --> 04:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
all those dams and bring them into
 
04:37:22.760 --> 04:37:23.629 align:start position:0%
all those dams and bring them into
current

04:37:23.629 --> 04:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
compliance and so as the senator
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned historically the costs for
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
operation maintenance repair of
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams were funded by solely
 
04:37:34.750 --> 04:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
by the dam maintenance fund and the dam
 
04:37:36.390 --> 04:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund does receive revenue
 
04:37:38.670 --> 04:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
from hydropower sources we currently
 
04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
lease about nine dams to hydropower
 
04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
entities throughout the state and we
 
04:37:45.910 --> 04:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
take a portion of the revenue generated
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
at those sites as lease payments back to
 
04:37:47.760 --> 04:37:48.910 align:start position:0%
at those sites as lease payments back to
the

04:37:48.910 --> 04:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
state what occurred in the early 2000s
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
is these power purchase agreements that
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
were set up in the 1980s with
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
PSNH uh the the hydropower um entities
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
were receiving roughly about uh 17 cents
 
04:38:08.789 --> 04:38:08.799 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour or thereabouts that
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
dropped in in the early 2000s when PSS H
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
renegotiated their above Market power
 
04:38:17.709 --> 04:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements in accordance to RSA
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
374f and now they're receiving roughly
 
04:38:23.310 --> 04:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
about 3. cents 6 cents per kilowatt hour
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
now there are are other factors that do
 
04:38:26.830 --> 04:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
come into play some of the renewable
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
energy credits that some of these sites
 
04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
are are seeing so um but overall the the
 
04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
revenue generated by these sites is
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
decreasing these sites are requiring a
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
lot more capital investment the same as
 
04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
what I previously mentioned for the
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
state owners dams so the the capital
 
04:38:45.670 --> 04:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
investment needs at these sites are are
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
are outpacing the um the revenue
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
generated by these sites and
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
so because of what happened in the early
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
2000s uh nhds worked with the
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2004 under SP 488 to
 
04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:06.039 align:start position:0%
review the effects of Rec the utility
 
04:39:09.269 --> 04:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
reconstruct restructuring and at that
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
time uh a legislative committee was
 
04:39:14.109 --> 04:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
formed that looked at different ways to
 
04:39:16.109 --> 04:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
generate Revenue the two big ones that
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
came out of that were the UN un
 
04:39:21.789 --> 04:39:21.799 align:start position:0%
unrefined roll toll gas tax to boter and
 
04:39:24.429 --> 04:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
a shoreline maintenance fee those two
 
04:39:28.750 --> 04:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
options were um were brought forth in
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislation however both both options
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
didn't make it through uh one didn't
 
04:39:34.230 --> 04:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
make it out of committee the other one
 
04:39:37.150 --> 04:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
was itl so since then we we've still
 
04:39:40.750 --> 04:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
been relying on increasing capital and
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
general funding needs to cover the
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
expenses of the dam Bureau as the dam
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund continues to to
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
decrease and so one thing that we'd be
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
very interested in as part of this
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
legislation is is a new committee
 
04:39:56.550 --> 04:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
however one thing we do want to realize
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
is that we we want to make sure we
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
actually get tangible results out of
 
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
this committee and we don't continue
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
just doing what we did in 2004 so
 
04:40:06.030 --> 04:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
certainly uh folks on the committee that
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee we we really want
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um they are interested
 
04:40:11.550 --> 04:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
in actually moving forward some
 
04:40:13.150 --> 04:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that can really make a
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
tangible difference to the dam Bureau
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
and cut down on the amount of capital
 
04:40:18.510 --> 04:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
and general fund money that we need to
 
04:40:20.550 --> 04:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
keep these dams in proper working
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
order the other thing that this
 
04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislation would do is um is amend RSA
 
04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
482 goon 12 that would um reclassify
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
non-- Mena
 
04:40:34.590 --> 04:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
stams allow I'm sorry allow nhcs to
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
reclassify non- Menace dams when a
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
failure of that Dam would impact um
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
folks Downstream that would actually
 
04:40:46.350 --> 04:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
require a higher Dam classification what
 
04:40:48.390 --> 04:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
essentially that is is
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
currently with non- Mena stams we can't
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
reclassify them if nothing has changed
 
04:40:55.948 --> 04:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
Downstream so even though there might be
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or house if that if that
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
house or infrastructure has been there
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
since the dam was originally classified
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh prior to 1981 we can't reclassify
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
that that Dam it's it's basically kind
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
of like a grandfathering clause the
 
04:41:13.150 --> 04:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
issue is becoming is even though nothing
 
04:41:15.270 --> 04:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
has changed Downstream those impacts of
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
a dam failure do impact other people
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
other than the dam owner a great example
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
of this is up in Newport last last July
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
actually I'm sorry at the end of June
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the big rains in July but we
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
had some big rains in June a non- menus
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
Dam failed took out a uh driveway and
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
did property damage to a downstream of
 
04:41:35.550 --> 04:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
butter that dam was inspected by the
 
04:41:37.110 --> 04:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
nhdes in
 
04:41:40.868 --> 04:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
2019 and those impacts were realized but
 
04:41:43.230 --> 04:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
because of the current statute we were
 
04:41:45.788 --> 04:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
unable to reclassify that Dam to try to
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
bring it up to proper working order so
 
04:41:49.708 --> 04:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
this this helps clarify some of that the
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
other thing that would also help clarify
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
is because of the the revenue sources
 
04:41:56.110 --> 04:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at we are looking at
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
potentially selling some of our Hydro
 
04:42:00.628 --> 04:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
dams uh we are in negotiations right now
 
04:42:03.390 --> 04:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
currently with a hydro operator to
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
purchase one of our sites so we want to
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
just make sure that any Revenue not just
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hydro lease Revenue but any sale revenue
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
or any other Revenue can be deposited
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
back into that Dam maintenance fund and
 
04:42:22.270 --> 04:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
04:42:26.350 --> 04:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question this kind of a
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
general question but say you do sell the
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
dam to a private um company what role
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
does the state still play in um
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
inspecting the dam or any other
 
04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
oversight of the
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
dam so the the vast majority with a very
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
few exceptions of hydropower dams are
 
04:42:47.788 --> 04:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Federal Energy
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission so they're
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
regulated by the fits uh so that would
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
that would certainly transfer each hydr
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
power Dam has to have a license through
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
FK and that license would be continued
 
04:43:01.110 --> 04:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
to be held by the hydropower
 
04:43:04.270 --> 04:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
generator uh and so that site from a
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory standpoint would still be
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
regulated in the same manner and fashion
 
04:43:10.590 --> 04:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
that it is currently today if it was a
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
nonh hydrop power site so if it was a uh
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
a dam in which a municipality wanted to
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
take over or a Lake
 
04:43:19.948 --> 04:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
Association the St State Dam safety
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
program would still regulate that Dam
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
the same way it's currently regulated
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
we're still subject to all um Dam safety
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
regulations with all the state owned
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
dams and so those regulations would
 
04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:43:42.788 --> 04:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you said some of
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
the money from um leasing goes to the
 
04:43:50.350 --> 04:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
dam fund what happens to the rest of it
 
04:43:52.590 --> 04:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I I I'm apparently misspoke
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
it all goes to the damn maintenance fund
 
04:44:00.030 --> 04:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
Clark for taking my question so if I me
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
to understand you correctly the um kind
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the shortfall or the the the loss of
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
funds in the in the dam fund is increase
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
in cost too as well right not just the
 
04:44:19.550 --> 04:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
the fall of Revenue but increased costs
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you have two things going on
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
simultaneously the costs are ex
 
04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
escalating the revenue is decreasing um
 
04:44:27.070 --> 04:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
has the has the bureau thought about
 
04:44:29.230 --> 04:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
transferring those high cost dams to
 
04:44:31.628 --> 04:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
local municipalities so that they don't
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
have to absorb that cost I know in the
 
04:44:36.270 --> 04:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
public works Committee in the house they
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
amended the 10-year Transportation plan
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
to transfer a road to to the town of
 
04:44:43.990 --> 04:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
marac that they wouldn't have those
 
04:44:46.110 --> 04:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
expenses has that been thought of to do
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
with the dams uh certainly any town of
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
municipality would like to seek to take
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
over a dam um that they're certainly
 
04:44:53.550 --> 04:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to come to the dam
 
04:44:55.868 --> 04:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
Bureau to do so there are some dams in
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
the state that I believe the state would
 
04:44:59.590 --> 04:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
like to retain such as Lake Port Dam at
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
the AL wnab basaki some of these big
 
04:45:03.430 --> 04:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
lakes just because of the economic
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
driver that the the state has with those
 
04:45:08.430 --> 04:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
bodies of water and the public trust and
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
other items that go into that that body
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
of water but certainly um anytime a
 
04:45:16.030 --> 04:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
municipality or any other entity would
 
04:45:18.190 --> 04:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
like to take over the dam the the dam
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau is always open to that I think
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
there's also a realization by
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and others that these are
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
very expensive structures to own operate
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
maintain and therefore as of right
 
04:45:34.150 --> 04:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
now they're probably thinking you know
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
have the state continue doing those
 
04:45:38.270 --> 04:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
doing the work and the upkeep necessary
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
at these structures follow up Mr chair
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
what if what if a municipality didn't
 
04:45:46.270 --> 04:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
want that damn could the bureau force
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
them to take it no not currently okay
 
04:45:49.560 --> 04:46:03.430 align:start position:0%
them to take it no not currently okay
thank

04:46:03.430 --> 04:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:05.390 --> 04:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
um I understand sometimes dams are
 
04:46:12.270 --> 04:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
controlled by uh um different towns
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and but there is an
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
economic uh flow of that water let's
 
04:46:19.150 --> 04:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
talk about drought years not today we're
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
in we're in excessive water years but
 
04:46:24.110 --> 04:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
when there's not a drought year and if
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
some Town owns that specific Dam and
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
they decide to restrict the water can if
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
they took the dam would they would who
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
would then manage the water downflow
 
04:46:38.190 --> 04:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
from that and other lakes that or ponds
 
04:46:41.070 --> 04:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
that receed that water further
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
Downstream if they restrict the dam who
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
manages the Restriction of how much
 
04:46:49.470 --> 04:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
water flows through the dam if they own
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
it so from from statutes that affect the
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
dam bureau there's there's very little
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
in the way of requiring Downstream flows
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh one of the other Revenue sources that
 
04:47:06.430 --> 04:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
the dam Bureau does have is we have what
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
we call water user agreements so uh so
 
04:47:12.510 --> 04:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
for example water that comes out of Lake
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
Winn Abasi hydr power producers
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
Downstream pay a fee to the dam Bureau
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the use of the water coming out of
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
the lake and so contractually the state
 
04:47:23.788 --> 04:47:23.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire needs to provide that
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
that volume of water
 
04:47:31.390 --> 04:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
um the um that is the only statutory
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
requirement from the dam buau as far as
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
discharge there other there are other
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
programs within Dees such as the
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
instream flow program that if statute
 
04:47:43.150 --> 04:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
arily they are required to discharge
 
04:47:46.590 --> 04:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
water out of a certain water body um we
 
04:47:49.030 --> 04:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
we work closely with the instream flr
 
04:47:51.150 --> 04:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
program for example on the lamp River
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
Watershed if if we hit a drought year
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
then we have to discharge water at that
 
04:47:58.430 --> 04:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
point in time but as far as additional
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
statutes um requiring water to be
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
discharged those are really the only
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
ones that I'm familiar with from an
 
04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
operational standpoint there could be
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
other ones based on Flowage based on
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
Deeds uh that sort of thing that you
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
know someone Downstream could within
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
their deed have rights to a certain
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
volume of water out of a water body
 
04:48:20.160 --> 04:48:23.830 align:start position:0%
volume of water out of a water body
thank

04:48:23.830 --> 04:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question I'm
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
just confused the beginning of these
 
04:48:33.230 --> 04:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
letters and the bill talks about the
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
$300 million to really fix the hazard
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
High Hazard 63 dams and then the bill
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
goes on to talk about about
 
04:48:44.590 --> 04:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
declassifying non- Menace dams does this
 
04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
bill have anything to do with getting
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
you more money to do the 63 menacing Dam
 
04:48:52.510 --> 04:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
the portion of the bill that would
 
04:48:54.548 --> 04:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
address that would be the committee to
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
to look at other Revenue sources for the
 
04:48:59.070 --> 04:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
dam Bureau to address those High Hazard
 
04:49:01.230 --> 04:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
dams so it's just the committee there's
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
nothing specifically in here that says
 
04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to get money from here or
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:49:13.230 --> 04:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question what's the
 
04:49:16.830 --> 04:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
impact um of reclassifying a non- menace
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
Dam to a higher classification what's
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
the the financial cost or the cost to
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
the municipalities or something like
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
that so if if you classify a a So
 
04:49:30.430 --> 04:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
currently when we have the four
 
04:49:33.190 --> 04:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
classifications we have high significant
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
low Hazard and non- Menace the idea
 
04:49:37.150 --> 04:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
behind a non- Mena dam is should that
 
04:49:38.990 --> 04:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
Dam fail it's not going to impact
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
anybody Downstream really the only
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
people who should know would be the
 
04:49:42.120 --> 04:49:43.110 align:start position:0%
people who should know would be the
property

04:49:43.110 --> 04:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
owner if you were to if there was um
 
04:49:50.548 --> 04:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
someone else's property Downstream or um
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
a road or some other infrastructure that
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be damaged by failure of that non
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
menam and we would like to reclassify
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
that Dam that Dam would then fall into
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
one of the other categories whether High
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
significant or low based on those
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
different categories would be the um
 
04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
they would become subject to an annual
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
Dam dam registration fee in which lwh
 
04:50:10.948 --> 04:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams currently do not pay they
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
would then become subject to inspection
 
04:50:15.948 --> 04:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
frequencies and depending on the hazard
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
classification they they may or may not
 
04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
be required to develop an emergency
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
action plan all high and significant
 
04:50:24.990 --> 04:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams require an emergency action
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:31.280 --> 04:50:32.948 align:start position:0%
 
not

04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
anyone any other questions by members of
 
04:50:36.320 --> 04:50:37.548 align:start position:0%
anyone any other questions by members of
the

04:50:37.548 --> 04:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee let's see just said one one
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
question if uh do you get any
 
04:50:47.470 --> 04:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
contributions from people who have land
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
of residences or property uh out on the
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
lake side of the dam uh to help to help
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
keep upkeep of the dam the only the only
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we get from residents
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
around the lake occurs at very few water
 
04:51:08.590 --> 04:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
bodies Goose pond dam and Canan because
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire actually owns
 
04:51:11.430 --> 04:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
the rim
 
04:51:13.750 --> 04:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
of that water body so if you live if you
 
04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
have property on goosepond the state of
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire actually owns a sliver of
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
that and we lease that to the property
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
owner for their
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
use and um and there's a couple others
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh Lake Francis in Pittsburgh Dees owns
 
04:51:30.190 --> 04:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
around the entire water body we lease
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
Camp Lots up there uh Horus Lake over in
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
we there's I think nine lots that we
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
lease and um a couple others uh deing
 
04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
res where there's one
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
um lake winnisquam has uh several on the
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
canal leading up to the dam but overall
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
I'm talking you know just a couple dozen
 
04:51:54.670 --> 04:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
leases that actually generate Revenue
 
04:51:56.670 --> 04:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
into uh the dam maintenance fund as well
 
04:51:58.910 --> 04:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
other than that there's no other outside
 
04:52:01.628 --> 04:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
source so for example Lake winnes the
 
04:52:05.230 --> 04:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
dam does not receive any income from
 
04:52:06.750 --> 04:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
anything that occurs around the rim of
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
that Lake as far as directly into our
 
04:52:12.750 --> 04:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
my got to ask you in a different way
 
04:52:20.150 --> 04:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're benefiting from the existence of
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
the dam all the people behind the dam
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
have places and homes and mult some
 
04:52:32.910 --> 04:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
million dollar homes there and there's
 
04:52:36.910 --> 04:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
no way that they can that uh that they
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
would contribute if the dam was needed
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
to be uh needed to be upgraded or needed
 
04:52:47.310 --> 04:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
to needed work they would not be
 
04:52:50.830 --> 04:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
required to be contributed uh
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
then what if you took the dam away what
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
04:52:58.510 --> 04:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
then uh that there is a way of getting
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
rid of dams yes and you know maybe maybe
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's just me who doesn't own anything on
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
the on the water that so it's the
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
nobody is considering asking for uh
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
contributions to by the by the people
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
around the dams in the back of the dam
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
to contribute to the front of the dam to
 
04:53:24.480 --> 04:53:25.990 align:start position:0%
to contribute to the front of the dam to
fix

04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
fix
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
it so nobody's there's no no no no ask
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
on that well there's certainly no um
 
04:53:36.948 --> 04:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
Reven there's no there's no law there's
 
04:53:38.350 --> 04:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
no yeah there's no requirement for that
 
04:53:42.110 --> 04:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
to occur obviously will you know
 
04:53:43.830 --> 04:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
donations or other grants or anything
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
like that we always seeking different
 
04:53:47.788 --> 04:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
ways of generating Revenue but yes
 
04:53:50.430 --> 04:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
currently there is no requirement for us
 
04:53:54.030 --> 04:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
to gather funds from those um people
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
living around the impoundment that is
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
generated by the dam thank you president
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
Darcy Darby that's thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
thanks again for taking my question um
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcon expressed some
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
slight concerns about the um the time
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
frame of the committee completion at the
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
end at the beginning of November um I
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
believe in your testimony you said that
 
04:54:20.510 --> 04:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know you want it was important that
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
the committee were able to take action
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
do you have similar concerns about the
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
compressed time frame of this committee
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
and able to in its ability to to have uh
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
impactful results in a few months well
 
04:54:36.548 --> 04:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to get the best
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
benefit as we can out of out of the the
 
04:54:43.868 --> 04:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
committee if it was formed and so um if
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
if uh this committee feels that it would
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to to come back at a later
 
04:54:53.548 --> 04:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
date or different time un which we could
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
have um more time to get this right then
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
the dam Bureau would be certainly
 
04:55:02.910 --> 04:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
um we would support that because we we
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it gets right and
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
if if if trying to squeeze it into too
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
tight of a time frame um impacts that
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
then yeah we would
 
04:55:17.948 --> 04:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
certainly okay representative
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%

589 for the record my name is Regina
 
05:02:54.510 --> 05:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
burzell I'm state senator for district
 
05:02:57.070 --> 05:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
19 which encompasses the towns of dairy
 
05:02:58.430 --> 05:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hamstead and
 
05:03:02.190 --> 05:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
Windham and I believe I was um a couple
 
05:03:04.230 --> 05:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
of years ago I had put in a bill very
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
similar to this um this is uh this was
 
05:03:10.830 --> 05:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
requested by the town of dairy
 
05:03:14.430 --> 05:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
and what what it does thank you what it
 
05:03:14.440 --> 05:03:16.470 align:start position:0%
and what what it does thank you what it
does

05:03:16.470 --> 05:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:03:19.708 --> 05:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
um it basically it's the objective is
 
05:03:21.788 --> 05:03:21.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is to allocate funds generated
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
from the sech charge towards Economic
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
Development initi initiatives in the
 
05:03:29.310 --> 05:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
town um on waste water we did something
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
very similar similar to this in 2021 and
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
you have a a letter that the town um
 
05:03:38.830 --> 05:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
administrator Dave Karen had written but
 
05:03:41.948 --> 05:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
what we did is is um up until that
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
period of time the water that went
 
05:03:49.150 --> 05:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
through um to Dairy was um 100% of it
 
05:03:51.868 --> 05:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be um just for the
 
05:03:55.510 --> 05:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the um the water system
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
well there were millions of there was a
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
lot of money in that um in that account
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
and it was more than enough to uh there
 
05:04:06.030 --> 05:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
was more than enough in that account to
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead and continue maintaining it so
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
what they had asked to do is um have
 
05:04:15.788 --> 05:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
about 15% of that be able to be put
 
05:04:18.510 --> 05:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
towards uh economic development in the
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
town and we did pass it and it's been
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
it's really been a boom boom to Dairy
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
and we're asking for this a similar
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
situation with the
 
05:04:33.390 --> 05:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
Wastewater um they have um a lot of the
 
05:04:36.910 --> 05:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
waste waterer uh runs through Dairy and
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
um they as uh Karen said the dairy Town
 
05:04:43.628 --> 05:04:43.638 align:start position:0%
Council supports London dairy's efforts
 
05:04:46.830 --> 05:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
to Maxim maximize the development along
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
the exit 4A Corridor it allows a 15%
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
surcharge on outof Town Wastewater
 
05:04:54.670 --> 05:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
customers it provides modest Revenue
 
05:04:56.590 --> 05:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
stream for dairies so it does very
 
05:04:59.110 --> 05:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
similar to the bill that we passed in
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
2021 and I ask for your support on uh
 
05:05:04.350 --> 05:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
05:05:08.030 --> 05:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
589 and I'll take any questions okay any
 
05:05:15.868 --> 05:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you senator
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if I understand
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
the the language in um part three of
 
05:05:27.070 --> 05:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
this um with respect to um
 
05:05:30.670 --> 05:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities governed under RSA 49
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
d3i that would only apply to towns and
 
05:05:36.990 --> 05:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
not to cities in terms of how they can
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
um spend the um the Sur charge is that
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
is that the intent that is my
 
05:05:45.230 --> 05:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
understanding but I I think
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
um there are others behind me that can
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
answer that a little bit more
 
05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately but I believe so just
 
05:05:56.670 --> 05:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing we ALS we also have
 
05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
one of the town councilors from da here
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
um Brian chello that will um be able to
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
um Talk a little bit about the benefits
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
of what's happened in Dairy
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:32.910 --> 05:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
energy good morning Mr chairman members
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh Josh Elliott I am
 
05:06:38.230 --> 05:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
the director of the division of policy
 
05:06:39.548 --> 05:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
and programs for the New Hampshire dep
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um if you're
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
confused as to why I'm here rather yes
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
um so under the statutes the department
 
05:06:49.708 --> 05:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
of energy also oversees regulation of
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
water and sewer systems that are reg
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
that are considered regulated utilities
 
05:06:56.350 --> 05:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
um so the statute actually here that's
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
being amended is part of the statutes of
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
overseas the um the bill in question U
 
05:07:06.628 --> 05:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
makes that change um that Senator Burell
 
05:07:08.788 --> 05:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
spoke to uh about allowing uh
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
essentially municipality to go beyond
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
their own town boundaries um and not be
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
considered a public utility provided
 
05:07:17.868 --> 05:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
that they only charge uh less than 15%
 
05:07:21.070 --> 05:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
above what the in town rate is uh for
 
05:07:22.750 --> 05:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and I can't say to why
 
05:07:25.470 --> 05:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
this is true this allowance was made for
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
Water Systems so if you're transporting
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
drinking water across town lines you're
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
able to do this for whatever reason the
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
statute never allowed for waste water to
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
for the same ability so for example if
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
you had a town municipally runed uh
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
sewer system they wanted to extend to
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
the next town over uh if they charged
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
anything more than what they charged
 
05:07:47.590 --> 05:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
their own in town customers they would
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
then be considered a regulated utility
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
and then their rates would be um uh set
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
by the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:07:56.390 --> 05:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
rather than by the voters or or or
 
05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
commission within the
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
community so we think this allowance is
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable and matches with
 
05:08:05.788 --> 05:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
existing statute provides for the uh
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Systems the department
 
05:08:10.230 --> 05:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
did request um and we'd like to thank
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Burell for for doing this uh
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill um as amended by
 
05:08:18.510 --> 05:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate um adds two very important
 
05:08:21.390 --> 05:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
words um later in the statute um that
 
05:08:23.310 --> 05:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see the bolded language on lines
 
05:08:26.788 --> 05:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
12 and 13 that just add or SE um as you
 
05:08:28.350 --> 05:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
may be aware the department of energy is
 
05:08:30.430 --> 05:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
a recent Creation in the last two and a
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
half years uh that was created through
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
the budget process we're in the process
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
of taking all what had been Public
 
05:08:37.868 --> 05:08:37.878 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission rules and bringing
 
05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
them over to the Department of energy
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
as part of that we've been looking at
 
05:08:45.430 --> 05:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
the water and the sewer rules and the uh
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
current uh rule structure um makes it
 
05:08:50.590 --> 05:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
clear that Community sewer systems so
 
05:08:52.990 --> 05:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
for example if you have a condo
 
05:08:54.910 --> 05:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
association or homeowners association
 
05:08:56.910 --> 05:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
where there's essentially communal um
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
sewer system that's not connected as
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
part of a town or something like that
 
05:09:01.030 --> 05:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of within within the
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
development um we do not consider them a
 
05:09:06.270 --> 05:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
public utility uh as going through the
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
gel car process um for establishing
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
rules the Jael car staff disagreed with
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
our interpretation um that this statute
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
would also for allow um the um for the
 
05:09:23.830 --> 05:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
consideration of those Community Systems
 
05:09:26.190 --> 05:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
to not be considered public
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
utilities they disagreed with that
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
initial interpretation they had
 
05:09:31.030 --> 05:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
requested that we seek this change from
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature to make it very clear in
 
05:09:36.430 --> 05:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
that statute that both water and sewer
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
systems of the for these Community
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
associations are not considered public
 
05:09:43.830 --> 05:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
utilities um I think uh I can speak for
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
both the department and the Public
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that we have no
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
interest in regulating these little
 
05:09:50.670 --> 05:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
Community sewer systems um this would
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
just be purely on a financial basis we
 
05:09:54.030 --> 05:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
have no interest in doing that there's
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
no reason to do that there's no purpose
 
05:09:57.030 --> 05:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
of doing
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
that I will just add that this does not
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
change any of the regulations that our
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues at the department
 
05:10:05.310 --> 05:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
environmental services does so all the
 
05:10:06.990 --> 05:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations that currently
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
apply to these systems continue to apply
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
to these systems it's just we are not
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
going to regulate them making it clear
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
in the statute that we are not going to
 
05:10:18.030 --> 05:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
regulate them on a financial
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
basis any questions by members of the
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%

um of the E extra funds for selling
 
05:10:42.628 --> 05:10:42.638 align:start position:0%

D yes good afternoon Mr chairman
 
05:11:15.628 --> 05:11:15.638 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Brian
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
chirichello I'm a Dar Town counselor I
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
can give you a little bit of perspective
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
as to um some of the backstory of the of
 
05:11:26.548 --> 05:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
why we're here for this bill um as
 
05:11:29.628 --> 05:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
Senator birdell mentioned um back a
 
05:11:32.430 --> 05:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago we were approached
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
by um the Senate Senator Morse by the
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
way um looking to wield water through
 
05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
Derry um Windam Salem plastow eventually
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
getting to plastow because plastow
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
needed some water um and so um we worked
 
05:11:55.150 --> 05:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
together with the then Senate President
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
um the state paid for the the
 
05:12:00.430 --> 05:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to wield this water uh
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
and we were able to um you know charge
 
05:12:06.750 --> 05:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the the water going through to
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
our uh our our neighbors to the South um
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
what's important to know is more and
 
05:12:15.708 --> 05:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
more the the communities in our area are
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
really kind of looking to regionalize
 
05:12:19.868 --> 05:12:19.878 align:start position:0%
some things we want to share resources
 
05:12:23.948 --> 05:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
if we can um and if you look at if you
 
05:12:25.868 --> 05:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
if you knew where dairy was and where
 
05:12:28.350 --> 05:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
their their sewer system is
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
located um and you've probably all heard
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
about Exit 4
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
a the new exit off of um
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
93 you'd know that it's it's like right
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
over the line is it's very close this
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
the sewer system of dairies uh and the
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
development of London dairies so um it
 
05:12:50.910 --> 05:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense um to help our neighboring
 
05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
towns where we can uh the only thing is
 
05:12:56.270 --> 05:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
is obviously we' we'd have to you know
 
05:12:58.110 --> 05:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
we we need to benefit as well so that's
 
05:13:00.390 --> 05:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
where the extra charge would
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
be um So currently der's wielding water
 
05:13:06.910 --> 05:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
to the you know the five communities
 
05:13:08.788 --> 05:13:08.798 align:start position:0%
south of us all the way to plastal and
 
05:13:10.868 --> 05:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
now one der is asking us for sewer
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
capacity which we have in Derry and
 
05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
we're willing to share because again
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
sharing resources is really what it's
 
05:13:20.110 --> 05:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
all about so I'm happy to answer any
 
05:13:22.750 --> 05:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone has about how that
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:32.910 --> 05:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
established anybody uh have a question
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:43.230 --> 05:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
oh okay he can put his own
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so I understand
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill is uh really helping out
 
05:13:55.628 --> 05:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
Dairy and lary would could this possibly
 
05:13:57.548 --> 05:13:57.558 align:start position:0%
expand into other towns and other towns
 
05:14:00.548 --> 05:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
could actually expand if they wanted to
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
with this you know Elevate you know
 
05:14:05.948 --> 05:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
passing this bill opens the opportunity
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
for other towns too correct yes
 
05:14:09.548 --> 05:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
representative that's
 
05:14:11.070 --> 05:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's exactly right it doesn't
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
specify Dairy lond andair other
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
communities can use it and I hope that
 
05:14:16.590 --> 05:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
they do because again we're sharing
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
resources you know we're saving we're
 
05:14:21.788 --> 05:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
saving Londoner some money Londoner can
 
05:14:23.548 --> 05:14:23.558 align:start position:0%
actually build their infrastructure and
 
05:14:26.110 --> 05:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
send it up to Manchester but it's very
 
05:14:29.830 --> 05:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
very costly so again where location is
 
05:14:32.350 --> 05:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
and we you know sharing resources it's
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
great because um as you probably well
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
know with Tusk and kitchen that
 
05:14:39.070 --> 05:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
development there this this one here
 
05:14:40.510 --> 05:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
Woodmont Orchards is actually a little
 
05:14:43.270 --> 05:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
bit bigger in size um the process may
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
take a little bit longer but you know
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be an economic bone
 
05:14:49.548 --> 05:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
for that area along with the exit the
 
05:14:51.310 --> 05:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
new exit off of
 
05:14:54.030 --> 05:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
93 so I think I think other communities
 
05:14:55.230 --> 05:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
could use
 
05:14:57.868 --> 05:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
05:15:00.310 --> 05:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
Darby thank thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:15:01.510 --> 05:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
question um the so Wastewater systems as
 
05:15:08.030 --> 05:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
I think we heard earlier um in other
 
05:15:10.230 --> 05:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
bills are EXP ensive to maintain but it
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're trying to take the
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
goal is to take some of these funds and
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
put them to other um to other
 
05:15:18.030 --> 05:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
development purposes and that's I I
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
understood you that's that's the benefit
 
05:15:22.590 --> 05:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
that der's going to receive from this
 
05:15:22.600 --> 05:15:24.030 align:start position:0%
that der's going to receive from this
yeah

05:15:24.030 --> 05:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:15:26.750 --> 05:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
so if you if you look at a town budget
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
typically water and waste water what we
 
05:15:30.788 --> 05:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
call Enterprise funds they're typically
 
05:15:32.670 --> 05:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
for the for the people that use them
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
they're not a general fund uh money so
 
05:15:40.628 --> 05:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
um with the water example if we're
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
wielding water to the south of us and
 
05:15:45.150 --> 05:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's we're charging x amount per water
 
05:15:47.350 --> 05:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
flow you can see that we're going to
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
actually in perpetuity we're going to
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
we'll have a lot of money so technically
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
without the bill that Senator bdel put
 
05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
in to actually be able to use some of
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
that that Enterprise money it had to
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
stay in that particular
 
05:16:04.910 --> 05:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
fund so um we had asked uh uh Senator
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
birdell to to put in a bill which would
 
05:16:09.390 --> 05:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
allow us to use some some of that money
 
05:16:10.868 --> 05:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
for economic development so it's really
 
05:16:13.548 --> 05:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
a win-win for the town of Derry we're
 
05:16:16.270 --> 05:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
helping our our sister towns but then we
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
were using some of that money to um use
 
05:16:22.750 --> 05:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
for economic development in the
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
town you Mr thank you Mr chair um on a
 
05:16:30.590 --> 05:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
followup is there um if there were
 
05:16:32.190 --> 05:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
problems with the Wastewater system for
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
example the capacity was exceeded over
 
05:16:36.548 --> 05:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
time you know is there is there
 
05:16:38.110 --> 05:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
potential that because these funds were
 
05:16:41.230 --> 05:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
not a available that you'd have to dip
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
into get uh State funding or something
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
like that in order to support um you
 
05:16:48.868 --> 05:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
know revitalizing the waste an over
 
05:16:50.548 --> 05:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
taxed Wastewater
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
system uh I so I'm going to you know the
 
05:16:54.990 --> 05:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
wording says the inter Municipal
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
agreement so it really depends on the
 
05:16:59.230 --> 05:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
legality of the wording there I mean I
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
know that the the state put in for the
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
water now going back to the water they
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
put the the state put the infrastructure
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
in um but eventually 50 years down the
 
05:17:10.868 --> 05:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
road Maybe the town would have to fix
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
fix the those those um infrastructure
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
pieces so it would be wise for my my
 
05:17:18.548 --> 05:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
water department basically would set
 
05:17:21.070 --> 05:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
aside some monies knowing full well that
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
eventually down the road we'd have to
 
05:17:24.628 --> 05:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
make some of those repairs I think I
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
answered the
 
05:17:25.760 --> 05:17:27.788 align:start position:0%
answered the
question

05:17:27.788 --> 05:17:27.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:30.190 --> 05:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
wolf thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:17:37.270 --> 05:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is there any
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
possibility that it's some some point
 
05:17:41.788 --> 05:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
down the road you would run out of
 
05:17:45.910 --> 05:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
capacity or Supply if it's the water
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
capacity on the
 
05:17:50.270 --> 05:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
swer so if we're talking about the water
 
05:17:53.470 --> 05:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
side of things I think the state has a
 
05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
plan that they've actually utilized um
 
05:17:58.548 --> 05:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
for water right now D gets its water
 
05:18:00.510 --> 05:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
from Lake Massabesic which is
 
05:18:03.628 --> 05:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
Manchester's water um water source and a
 
05:18:06.150 --> 05:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
few other towns but I believe the state
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
has invested in in some water projects
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
off of the ma River to actually keep the
 
05:18:14.350 --> 05:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
the the flow at a you know we're not
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to run out of water anytime soon
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
um as far as the the the sewer portion
 
05:18:22.990 --> 05:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
of that we we understand our capacity of
 
05:18:25.548 --> 05:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
what we have uh and we have planners
 
05:18:27.030 --> 05:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
that that are looking at where our
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
buildout is der's you know der's a third
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
uh fourth largest community in the state
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
we have 35,000 people we we kind of know
 
05:18:36.750 --> 05:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
where the plans are for future so
 
05:18:39.030 --> 05:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
whatnot so before we make made that
 
05:18:40.868 --> 05:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
decision we we understand where we're at
 
05:18:43.150 --> 05:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
and we're comfortable uh with the
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:50.190 --> 05:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
have anyone
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:54.958 --> 05:18:56.548 align:start position:0%
 
much

05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
much

planned unit development it straddles
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
i93 um and uh we're talking specifically
 
05:19:42.430 --> 05:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
here about the east side of 93 um that's
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 200 Acres which according
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the master plan for this plan unit
 
05:19:51.230 --> 05:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
development um entails uses of vital
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
importance both to London Derry but also
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
to the regional and state economy um and
 
05:19:59.430 --> 05:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
that includes 350 residential units
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
420,000 and 300 uh beds of institutional
 
05:20:06.990 --> 05:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
use uh no limit limit on Civic uses a
 
05:20:10.548 --> 05:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
200 bed hotel and 700,000 uh Square ft
 
05:20:14.548 --> 05:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
of commercial uh use all of these come
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
um with a significant sewer demand and
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh hence why we are here today um the uh
 
05:20:24.910 --> 05:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
really um what what I would suggest to
 
05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
the committee is in order to realize the
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
promise of that mixed use plan uh that
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
really is inherent in the Woodmont
 
05:20:33.510 --> 05:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
commment uh development um we we need to
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
secure additional sewer capacity and as
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chello said we could invest in that
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
by building
 
05:20:42.430 --> 05:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh a long pipe to Manchester at a a
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
significant uh significantly greater
 
05:20:47.230 --> 05:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
expense um but we've been fortunate
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
enough to uh have good relations with
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
our neighbors in Derry um and uh and and
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
and that has uh has brought us here
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
today um I would just point out a couple
 
05:21:00.830 --> 05:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
of things one is that it's not automatic
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
um so this this legislation would not
 
05:21:05.310 --> 05:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
automatically increase rates uh to
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
anyone that needs to occur pursuant to
 
05:21:09.548 --> 05:21:09.558 align:start position:0%
an intermunicipal agreement agement uh
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
and as been as has been pointed out we
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
do have a intermunicipal agreement with
 
05:21:15.910 --> 05:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
the uh town of Derry it has Provisions
 
05:21:17.868 --> 05:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
for what happens if we run out of
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
capacity what happens if there are uh
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
required infrastructure upgrades uh
 
05:21:24.430 --> 05:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
London Derry participates in those
 
05:21:26.670 --> 05:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
upgrades um that may be required in the
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
future um according to the proportion uh
 
05:21:31.868 --> 05:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
that it is rece it is sending uh sewer
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
sewer flows to Dairy um M Mr chair
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I suggest that
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
this uh presents communities with uh
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to cooperate um
 
05:21:43.510 --> 05:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for additional uh choice
 
05:21:46.230 --> 05:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
and flexibility um and really londondary
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
supports this because it is a relatively
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
modest payment that will yield millions
 
05:21:52.990 --> 05:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
of dollars of tax revenue um and those
 
05:21:54.990 --> 05:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
badly needed uses uh that I mentioned
 
05:21:56.948 --> 05:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
earlier so again in closing I want to
 
05:21:58.590 --> 05:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank uh the dairy Town Administrator
 
05:22:00.670 --> 05:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
the dairy Town Council um and the
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
Senators that I mentioned uh for
 
05:22:03.788 --> 05:22:03.798 align:start position:0%
supporting this legislation and I'm
 
05:22:06.670 --> 05:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take any of the committee's
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
