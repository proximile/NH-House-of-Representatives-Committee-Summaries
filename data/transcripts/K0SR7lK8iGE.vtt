1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We have the O2 here to talk about why it's in the...

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Can you do me a favor?

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:57.500
With your eyes, I don't know any difference there is between the two version and the new version because i think we can all agree the version that's 1224 needs to be changed so we don't need to even look at the one which is 1224 correct correct i guess i'll make it official is that've got the Committee of Conference on House Bill 224.

12
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't do a whole lot of these things.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That's not certainly my favorite thing to do.

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:32.000
While we're going over the amendment that was just supplied by Senator Waters on a possible change to the civil liability for damage or obstruction to highways, why don't we start with something a little easier and look at the sharing of motor vehicle records by employer access to motor vehicle records.

15
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That did go.

16
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That's on 134.

17
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
It was a committee conference this morning.

18
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.500
I just checked in the couple of the members that sat in on it.

19
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
It wasn't even discussed.

20
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.000
It passed the House floor and that's on 134.

21
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
There was a committee of conference this morning.

22
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I just checked with a couple of the members that sat in on it.

23
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It wasn't even discussed.

24
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:19.500
It passed the House floor, and it's been signed off on, even though the report's not available, and it's moving to the consent calendar for next week.

25
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000
Yeah, I think they've seen it to the House.

26
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Yeah.

27
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.500
So is there any need for that to stay on 224?

28
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500
Anybody's opinion?

29
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.500
No.

30
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500
Okay.

31
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Do you guys see any reason for it to be on 224.

32
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.500
Anybody's opinion?

33
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500
No.

34
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.500
Can you guys see any reason for it to be on 224?

35
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.000
Looks like this and what's on the civil opinion.

36
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Well, let's look at that then.

37
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I didn't see any differences either.

38
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You said the version in HB 2 of the civil liabilities portion or amendment is different than what you just handed me?

39
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That's what DOT says.

40
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Kathy can explain it.

41
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.500
Kathy, do you want to try and explain it?

42
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Sure.

43
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.000
Thank you for hearing this.

44
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.500
That's all the difference between what you're talking about.

45
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.500
Thank you for hearing this text.

46
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.000
Welcome to the house and let's see.

47
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The difference between what you have in the hand and what's in HD2 is provision 3.

48
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The heart rate uses estimated cost on the right to the right.

49
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.500
Damages for the high level of highway.

50
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500
.

51
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:13.500
HB's office raising us to use estimated costs, but only going forward with future So we have $5 million in pending claims that we want authority to use estimated losses.

52
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.000
So this version doesn't say anything about part three.

53
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.500
Now, what's in the back page, right?

54
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.000
This is only part two.

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.500
So is there another section to this that we did that?

56
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:57.000
well this is that's the that's the new section three well this is still one and two no it's three and three down below so the proposal is to put three into ours so it so it's different than what hb2 says correct it allows them It says this section applies to all pending claims.

57
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:08.500
So any 500 close to $500,000 worth of claims that are pending right now, they will be able to use the actual act.

58
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.500
The replacement.

59
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500
The estimated cost.

60
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.500
Which Can I ask a question?

61
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:25.000
When this was heard in the House Judiciary, was there any issue with the retroactive ability of the consent?

62
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Yes.

63
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Representative, more than the retroactive this is what we've done all the long time.

64
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.500
So when you're talking about where we're here saying pending claims, so it's not retroactive, they're still active claims.

65
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.500
Correct.

66
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.000
They're just waiting to be paid out.

67
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
They haven't been indicated.

68
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So it's not like they're going back to an accident that had already been settled and added additional.

69
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
No.

70
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
It's just, it's pending.

71
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Right.

72
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It was part three in the original version that was introduced in the judiciary.

73
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Yes.

74
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I don't believe in that policy this year, but I know it was in an agent to originally as a governor's office.

75
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
That's interesting.

76
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
House Judiciary taken out?

77
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:40.000
House Judiciary had killed the bill because it wasn't that part of the bill because it was an agent to.

78
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000
They had also objected to the work strictly as a strictly viable and the agreement to take that work strictly.

79
00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:54.500
but senate house judiciary never amended it because they they had the amendment i think available but they determined that because it was in hb2 they didn't need to even deal with it right they didn't need to do any amending and the version of hb2 moved section three which which they had issues in post-judiciary to begin right yes this is great and this is all over a bill that was not even heard in transportation and i don't understand why i think that yeah things happen sometimes yeah okay um any other questions from anybody else i think we've all followed the path from where we are without even even, I don't have to ask, of course, this is what you want this amendment to look like.

80
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.000
This takes care of the procedural problems.

81
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.500
I do agree with the philosophy that the taxpayers shouldn't be paying for things twice.

82
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.000
So if somebody else damages them, they should get paid for.

83
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I don't disagree with that philosophy.

84
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.500
I'm seeing that we're strictly gone, but I agree.

85
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.000
Let's chat for a moment.

86
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.500
Yeah, we'll be right back.

87
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.000
I'm seeing the word strictly gone, but I agree.

88
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.500
Let's chat for a moment.

89
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.500
Yeah, we'll do a break back.

90
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.500
Yep.

91
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.000
Just want to put something on paper.

92
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Yep.

93
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.500
So I don't do this, I don't do this.

94
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500
Thank you.

95
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500
Thank you.

96
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.500
Thank you.

97
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.500
Thank you.

98
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.500
Thank you.

99
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500
Thank you.

100
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.500
Thank you.

101
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
Thank you.

102
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.500
Thank you.

103
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.500
Thank you.

104
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.500
Yeah, I know.

105
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.000
You shouldn't have let me out of the room.

106
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Any need for any more discussion from anywhere?

107
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Are we good?

108
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Let's see.

109
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Recognize Vice Chair for a motion.

110
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Thank you, Mr.

111
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Chairman.

112
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The House accedes to the Senate position upon further amendment.

113
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
That amendment is amendment referring employer access of driving records is approved.

114
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Language referring to civil liability to highways will be amended using language provided this committee, which matches language HP 2 for sections 1 and 2, as well as adding section 3, which applies to pending claims.

115
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
As far as an effective date.

116
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
On this draft.

117
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
On HB2.

118
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.500
The HB2 version is an effective date.

119
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.500
May it the same?

120
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:18.500
The way this motion, right, well, the way the motion is read, the way I understand it, I wrote it.

121
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:26.500
we're going to be using this amendment that was provided to the committee by Senator Lauders.

122
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:33.000
Mirrors the language of HB 2 in terms of sections 1 and 2.

123
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.500
It also adds section 3.

124
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:41.000
So do we need to change the effective date on 2-24?

125
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.500
What is the effective date?

126
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.500
Effective date shall take effect 60 days after its passage.

127
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500
And later upon passage.

128
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.000
Yeah, and the revanche has to take effect upon its passage.

129
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
It's fine?

130
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So it's fine with 60 days.

131
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We're pulling out section five, right?

132
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And that's amended by the Senate?

133
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Yeah, that's the...

134
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Right, yeah.

135
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.500
So if we remove section five, then we just have sections, the actual effects 60 days after the past.

136
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:27.500
So I just want to make sure I'll go over to over to us.

137
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:33.000
Okay, and you're going to keep the 60 day effective day.

138
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Right.

139
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.500
Is there any issue with the judicial branch on on these changes for civil liability?

140
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:48.500
Again, this is judicial, so I don't usually talk about these things.

141
00:11:48.500 --> 00:12:24.000
I know it's sorry, as far as fine schedules, I know they want it to until the following january i just hope it's not a problem in 60 days let it know no we don't need to we're going to leave the effective date today okay so and yeah uh if you you want me to go down and do this, or you want me to go down and do this?

142
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Either way.

143
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
We can go together.

144
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Doesn't matter.

145
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Either way.

146
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And you're the chair of the...

147
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Right.

148
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000
You're, when you kept referring to Section 5, I didn't bring 134 with me.

149
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Is that what you're looking at?

150
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Thank you.

151
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
134 with me.

152
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Is that what you're looking at?

153
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So I'm working off of just to be...

154
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Okay.

155
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
All right.

156
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.500
HP 224 is amended by the Senate.

157
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.000
That's what we're working on.

158
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Right?

159
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yep.

160
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So...

161
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So here, Thank you.

162
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Thank you.

163
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Thank you.

164
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Thank you.

165
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Okay.

166
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Take the levitation.

167
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
This is back.

168
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Yep.

169
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
That's fine.

170
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So that's.

171
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So that's.

172
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So that's done.

173
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And then we are replacing replace for this.

174
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Fair enough.

175
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And then, right here, we're striking some of the office.

176
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Why don't I just give this to you?

177
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Okay?

178
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.500
This is what we want to do.

179
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.000
Yeah it's just section five.

180
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Yep.

181
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.500
Okay, so I'm going to give this to you.

182
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.500
No, I know.

183
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.500
That's the thing.

184
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.500
That will work.

185
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500
Thank you.

186
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
Thank you.

187
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.000
We're going to make this a little bit more.

188
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
No, I do not.

189
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Maria will let you know when that's right.

190
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Okay, so we need to vote on this to make it official, I guess.

191
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I'll ask the House members, do I agree?

192
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Yes.

193
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Okay, do we have an agreement?

194
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Do the senators agree?

195
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Just make it official.

196
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
gonna make it The Senate agrees.

197
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Thank you.

198
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Thank you.

Thank you.

218
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Thank you.

219
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Thank you.

220
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Thank you.

221
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Thank you.

222
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Thank you.

223
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000

224
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Thank you.

227
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Thank you.

228
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Thank you.

229
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Thank you.

230
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.500
I know you're always busy.

231
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.500
Well, next week.

232
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.500
Okay.

233
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.500
And I think we're going to be meeting with Craig.

234
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:21.500
And, you know, good meeting with Craig and I got to, I'll share with Craig we've got some edits from getting up here on the RFP.

235
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:27.500
So I will just, you know, maybe start to fall in place.

236
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.500
I'll probably get to be there for next.

237
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.500
Okay.

238
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.500
Shares all yours.

239
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.500
All right.

240
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.500
All right.

241
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.500
This is a conference on House Bill 235.

242
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.500
It's amended.

243
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.000
First, I think we might want to introduce ourselves.

244
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I'll start with myself, Andy Rizzullo.

245
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.500
I represent the town of Hudson and the town of Litchfield.

246
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:05.500
Mike Gunski representing the town of Boston Suzanne Smith representing Clemence Hebron and Holderman.

247
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:11.000
Senator Waters, district four, one of the two shirt sleeve senators.

248
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Yes, I am.

249
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
We called each other.

250
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.500
Senator Kevin Neibar, district 12.

251
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:23.500
And Senator Gray is actually in another conference at this particular time.

252
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.500
That's right.

253
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.500
He sends his regards.

254
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.500
Okay.

255
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.500
All right.

256
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.500
House Bill 235, which is the...

257
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.500
we non-concurred and requested a committee of conference.

258
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:49.000
235 started out as just a small volume, small groundwater withdrawal bill, and it had the PFAS fund attached to it.

259
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
We're in motion.

260
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.500
Well, we've worked it out.

261
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.000
The Senate concedes to the House position.

262
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
That's okay with you.

263
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Yeah, I think so.

264
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.500
Is there a proper motion for that?

265
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:27.500
basically we move to accept the house positions accept the house position so we see so that whole amendment that was added on is gone and so the house bill 235 goes on it's a good show I guess you should take a vote on it.

266
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500
Yes, I vote yes.

267
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.500
Yes.

268
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500
Yes.

269
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.500
Yes.

270
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.500
Yes.

271
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.500
That's it.

272
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.500
So I'm on House Bill 235.

273
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.500
Yes.

274
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500
Yes.

275
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.500
Yes.

276
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.500
Yes.

277
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.500
That's it.

278
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.500
So I'm on House Bill 1035.

279
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.500
Send seats to the House position.

280
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500
Motion to adjourn.

281
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.500
To adjourn.

282
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.000
And we have 28 minutes to go.

283
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
28 minutes to go.

284
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
We have to do it again.

285
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And I apologize because...

286
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Thank you.

287
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Thank you.

288
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Thank you.

289
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Thank you.

290
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Thank you.

291
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Thank you.

292
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Thank you.

293
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Thank you.

294
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Thank you.

295
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Thank you.

296
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Thank you.

297
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Thank you.

298
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Thank you.

299
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Thank you.

300
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Thank you.

301
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Thank you.

302
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Thank you.

303
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Thank you.

304
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Thank you.

305
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Thank you.

306
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Thank you.

307
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Thank you.

308
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Thank you.

309
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Thank you.

310
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Thank you.

311
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Thank you.

312
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Thank you.

313
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
All right.

314
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.500
that Gorder, the Committee of Conference on the House Bill 271.

315
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.500
We've already made the head introductions in the previous bill.

316
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.500
Senator, do you have an amendment?

317
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:30.500
We do have an amendment, and I was wondering if we could have Mike, one sec.

318
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.500
I'll talk about it.

319
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:41.000
There are a couple of minor changes with the amendment that you've got to mind that .

320
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
You said the law and that's good for some changes.

321
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.500
But Mike, do you need a mic?

322
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.500
Mike, over there?

323
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.000
Yeah, why don't you come over here?

324
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Just a simple fix.

325
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.500
It's a small amendment, not much to talk about.

326
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:08.000
The way this room is laid out, it's like, it's bad to everybody.

327
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Not feng shui.

328
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Well well this is what we're doing at committee thank you uh for the record my name is mike winced i service director of the waste management division for new hampshire dds uh we said two looking at the amendment that's being offered for HB 271 for this committee conference.

329
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Just the agency had two comments and minor changes that needed to be addressed that we could help improve it.

330
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
The first one is on page three line 31 of the amendment.

331
00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:02.000
It's under the heading of RSA 485 H8 duties of the department, and that is being amended by the bill in part.

332
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And we thought that on line 31, it reads as follows, establishing and administering the PFAS remediation loan program to assist municipalities.

333
00:22:13.000 --> 00:23:15.500
Because this amendment also creates and it provides authority for the department to administer grants as well as loans we thought that given the just for clarity and completeness this should now read it should have the word after the words PFAS remediation loan the words and grant should be added and then the word program which is already there should have an s added to it to make it plural so that as we're suggesting it be changed it would read as follows establishing and administering administrating the PFAS remediation loan and grant programs to assist municipalities and then second change is on the final page of the bill for the amendment which is page 5 on line 17 under the effective date section.

334
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.000
And this is a, I'm seeing why this happened.

335
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:40.000
This was a drafting error from something that we provided earlier, but because of the way the bill's 235 stands on its own now, what this entire bill 271 has proposed to be amended should take effect upon its passage.

336
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.500
There should be no delay for any portion of the bill.

337
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:59.500
So what we would propose is that Roman one, that line that says section four, this act shall take effect 60 days after his passage should be deleted.

338
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:07.000
And the new Roman one should read this act shall take effect upon his passage.

339
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.500
And that would be it.

340
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:16.000
Is there a great overview of the amendment that you want to discuss?

341
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I'd be happy to do that.

342
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:48.500
I think, you know, as I think the members of the Community Conference know this bill amends RSA 45H which already is passed and is a matter of law that it provides authority for the department to administer a PFAS remediation loan fund to address public drinking water systems and community water systems that have PFAS contamination above standards.

343
00:24:48.500 --> 00:25:05.500
And what this, the primary thing that this amendment would do is to provide also this grant authority to not just loans, but grants, and also to significantly to include municipalities in the categories.

344
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:13.500
So one of the problems we have is the way that the statute is currently constructed.

345
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:28.000
really only make loans to existing water systems, which could be run by a municipality or could be, you know, otherwise they a privately run or community water system.

346
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:43.000
But we know that there are a number of communities where PFAS contamination exists, where there is no public water system, where the municipality does not run public water system.

347
00:25:43.000 --> 00:26:01.500
And so we wanted to make sure that municipalities could seek loan or grant funds to stand up a new water system or maybe build a new infrastructure that would add on to an existing water system.

348
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:17.500
And so this makes it clear that municipalities, even if they don't currently own or operate a water system, are still eligible to apply for and receive these loan and grant funds.

349
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:40.500
And then also another significant thing in working with members of the House RR&D committee, it was very important to committee members and I think a lot of members of the legislature to be able to assist private well owners whose wells are impacted by PFAS.

350
00:26:40.500 --> 00:27:05.500
And so there's language in this amendment, and I guess I would direct your attention to page one of the amendment, starting on line 18, which is entitled Implementation of Drinking Water Protection Program, where we have language there that makes it clear that loans and grants can be made.

351
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:12.500
but it includes a description of municipalities for municipal use that I just described.

352
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:33.000
But then it also has the second line on D, which is on line 22, that municipalities can seek these funds in order to develop their own municipal programs to assist private well owners whose wells are impacted by PFAS contamination.

353
00:27:33.000 --> 00:28:03.500
And a good example of that is we have one community with a number of wells, private wells above standards, that wants to stand up a rebate program so that their homeowners who whose wells are impacted by PFAS could install, say, a point of use treatment filter under the sink that might cost them to have a contract to do.

354
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.500
It might be a thousand dollars.

355
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:20.000
This community wants to be able to run a rebate program to help those homeowners defray the cost of installation of that kind of a treatment system.

356
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:38.500
So this this bill would make it possible for us to administer a grant program, making grants to municipalities so that they could, in turn, stand up local programs to help their citizens whose wells are impacted.

357
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.500
Thank you very much.

358
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:47.500
So we're presenting this to you folks, and we hope that you like it.

359
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500
Yes.

360
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.000
Do you have an amendment number, the revised amendment?

361
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
No, what?

362
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
What do you do?

363
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000

Oh, the new one revised will be there when you go to sign off.

365
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Okay.

366
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.500
Yeah, just for no keeping, that's all so far.

367
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:21.500
So we got a little less, but I think we probably want to build up revisions.

368
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.500
Yeah.

369
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:43.000
