term in the
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
house uh Gary Gilmore do would three
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
this is my sixth term but it is my there
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
been a 22-year absence in between so
 
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080 align:start position:0%

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
this is my probably my fourth term on
 
00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:14.670 align:start position:0%
this is my probably my fourth term on
Election

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
Election
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
law welcome back okay um so we'll do
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
some quick housekeeping measures here um
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
so we have in our possession 70 bills we
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
might get to 80 um so that's more than
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
double the next Comm
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
um so for everyone who decided we
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have a table calendar you when
 
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
we're sitting through the 120th hour of
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
hearings you'll maybe think about that
 
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
but uh so because we're going to have 75
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
or 80 bills all said and done um we're
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
going everything we do is going to have
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
to be quick um
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
so I will do my best when scheduling to
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
figure out which bills have more public
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
interest than not um but I am not a
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
psychic um so things that I do is I look
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
at like online signups and that sort
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
sort of deal to kind of gather it but
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
because I have to do it a week out and a
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
lot of bills don't get pushed online for
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
Testimony it's a little bit of a
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
guessing game so I'll be relying on
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
experience um with topics we've handled
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
before and um obviously any sort of data
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
point that I can get but there will more
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
likely than not if there's significant
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
public testimony be time limits for
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
Testimony because otherwise we will be
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
here um we we actually just won't won't
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
make early Bill deadlines we just won't
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
do it so uh you can go ahead and block
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
off Tuesdays will be the days we
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
primarily meet um those days will be
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
mostly full days today is the exception
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
um because my wife has an ultrasound for
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
our new child so uh you guys got you
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
guys get to get off early because I get
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
to go and be a dad um but um other than
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of going to be the
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
Cadence uh I have told uh the ranking
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
member representative Lane I won't be
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
calling um any bills that's not noticed
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
without her consent it's not the rule
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
but we're going to do that um I think
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
it's a good practice of precedent so um
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
we will doing that um bills will be
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
noticed so you'll see in every time
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing the default will be
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
executive session may be called uh I do
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to open the bill up
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
for discussion so if we have some
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
downtime which I don't think we'll have
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
much of uh I'm going to put that in
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
there so we can talk to each other and
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
sort things out in public um but you
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about the vote
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
actually taking place uh unless it is
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
specifically noticed like it is this
 
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.509 align:start position:0%
specifically noticed like it is this
afternoon

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's um that's my big
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
speed trying to think if there's
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
anything else that I'm missing oh I need
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
to introduce our um committee assistant
 
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
Robin are you here or did she leave she
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
left all right so uh we have our uh
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee assistant Robin and our um oh
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not connected to the internet that's
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
worthless um I believe our researcher is
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
named David I'll send it around um but
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
um both our committee assistant and our
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee researcher are new um so if
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
you have anything um that you need
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
researched um obviously that goes
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
through the chair um but please you know
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
send it to me and um I I will say our
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
committee assistant's been wonderful so
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
far I haven't had a chance really to
 
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
interact with our committee researcher
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
too much but um if you need anything
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
she's wonderful I'm H here to help um
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
trying to think what else uh you'll you
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
should have they're they're working on
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
PR all of the bills but obviously we
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't have them all yet so they can't
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
print things they don't have um but when
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
that comes you can expect a uh a stack
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
thick um I think that's it does anybody
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
have any questions comments concerns
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
before we have the secretary of state do
 
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.069 align:start position:0%
before we have the secretary of state do
some

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079 align:start position:0%

manual uh which we distribute to all
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
local election officials who have
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in conducting an
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
election uh that's considered the Bible
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
of running
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
elections and you should have a copy of
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
that as well if you don't uh just come
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
and see us
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
um our office door by the way this is
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
Aon Hennessy who you'll probably be
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
seeing more than me uh during the
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
session Aon is my deputy secretary of
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
state and uh you know we have a great
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
working relationship and so so I'm sure
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of both of us uh over
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
the course of the
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
session the Secretary of State's office
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a fairly large state agency and the
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
among the divisions that we have are
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
corporations where we register all
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
business entities that operate in New
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we have the Bureau of
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
Securities which regulates um broker
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
dealers that deal with financial
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
instruments we have the division of
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
Vital Records which keeps track of
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
births deaths marriages uh divorces
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
things like that and we have the
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
division of archives and Records
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
management which uh keeps the state's
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
most historic uh
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
documents um everything that goes back
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
to pre-colonial times I think the oldest
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
document we have in the in the archives
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
is the mid 1600s and then a lot of
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
Records uh through the colonial times
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
some great civil war records uh uh
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
Governor records everything in between
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh and then we manage uh agency records
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
that are uh between active status and
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
destruction status there's a retention
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
period that we keep track of if agencies
 
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
need to retrieve records that are in the
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
archives uh we can uh do that for them
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh we've got over 100,000 boxes of
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
agency records in the state archives and
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
we uh you know there's constant uh new
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
records being brought to the archives
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
and a destruction process that goes
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
along with that but one of the most
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
important functions that we do uh in the
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is elections
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're here in front of
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
you this
 
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.389 align:start position:0%
you this
morning

00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
um we have been very busy the last
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
years um and the things that we've
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
accomplished are a brand new
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
registration database which replaced the
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
Legacy system that we had uh that's
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
going to be really beneficial to the
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
local election officials that really are
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintaining the data
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
that gets entered uh into the
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
system uh along with that we have in
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
place some really strong cyber security
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
measures to make sure that our
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
electronic systems are safe and secure
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
um and at some point in the future we
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
can talk about uh you know those those
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
processes and
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
procedures um the B ballot law
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
commission has approved two new ballot
 
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.949 align:start position:0%
commission has approved two new ballot
counting

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
counting
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
devices um that are replacing the Legacy
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
um acote system which has been used now
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
for 30 plus years in cities and towns in
 
00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:19.590 align:start position:0%
for 30 plus years in cities and towns in
New

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the newer devices use digital
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
scan technology which means that an
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
image of every single ballot can be
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
recorded and and the advantage to that
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
is it really opens up the doors to the
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
types of postelection audits that we can
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
conduct uh you know comparing the
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
electronic record to the actual physical
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
record of the actual paper ballot that
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
was cast in the
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
election um of the two devices that have
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
been approved one has um received EAC
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
election assistance um approvals the EAC
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
is a federal agency that sets standards
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
for those
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
devices um and so there are uh several
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
dozen Towns now that are you actually
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
using the voting Works device which
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
utilizes open source software and we can
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
talk about what that means in a future
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
election uh again significant
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
improvements the other device is the
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
Dominion uh image cast device which is
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
sold and maintained by LHS uh Associates
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
the same company that Services the ACU
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
vote machines that are out there um
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
their device is not being deployed yet
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
there're still waiting for some final
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
approvals uh in addition uh there is a
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
large number there are a large number of
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
towns now that are using electronic Pole
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
books as the check-in uh vehicle they
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
have to be maintained in parallel with a
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
paper checklist but the advantage that
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns are seeing uh are
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh uh efficiency when voters are
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
checking in because they can get into
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
any line to check in and not one that is
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
assigned by letters of the alphabet and
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
then at the end of the night when they
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
close out the electronic poll books the
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
number of Voters that actually checked
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
in for that election is instant and it
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
saves the supervisors of the checklist
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
the time of having to go through every
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
page on paper counting those uh those
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
numbers and then because the information
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
that is collected is in electronic form
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
that information can be uploaded to the
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
voter registration data base uh and
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully there will be a lot fewer
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
errors as a result of that process
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
because um the supervisors of the
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
checklist don't have to manually enter
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
that data that they're reading off of uh
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
a a checklist
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
form in addition to all of those items
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh and we've mentioned this to the
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
committee before but we have more funds
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
in The Help America vote act uh election
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
fund account that we need to actually
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
run that program and so we have been
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
cost sharing with cities and towns for
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
the purchase of new ballot counting
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
devices and electronic Pole books their
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
choice um and there are many towns that
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
have taken us up on that offer and we
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
are spending down some of the Sur plus
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
of the funds that we have in that
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
regard uh there's just uh two or three
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%

population in New Hampshire on a quick
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
relevant personal note for 10 years my

wife was a rehabilitation teacher at the

Perkins School for the Blind in
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
Watertown Massachusetts and the concern
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
that this proposed legislation addresses
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
is on accessible voting systems is near
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
and dear to my heart um to be up front
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is really the uh initiation of my
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
colleague uh representative Pig and uh
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
he's just allowed me the honor to speak
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
before this committee to set the context
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 67 allow me to briefly
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
review the Bill's predecessor from last
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
year House Bill
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
1264 in 2024 that bill was signed into
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
law by former governor sonunu on July
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
3rd prior to this law accessible voting
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
systems were in place only for State
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
elections with the federal office on the
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
ballot these systems were not made
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
available at polling locations for local
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
elections as a result except for a
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
couple of the communities that have
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
their own accessible voting systems
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities were not
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
universally afforded equal opportunities
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
to vote to vote privately and
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
independently in local elections this
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
lack of provision is in fact a violation
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the American with Disabilities Act
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
and its implementing
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
regulations last year election law heard
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony from the public as
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
to some of the hor speci ific
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
discriminatory voting experiences
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
endured by those voters who did not have
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
these systems available in fact some New
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities have been sued for
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
their failure to suitably provide
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
accessible voting systems during
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
election so the current law that was
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
enacted in July of 2024 now requires
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
that each polling place have at least
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
one accessible voting system for use in
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
local elections through a pilot program
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office the
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
secretary's office must share the
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
machines it has has with cities and
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
towns for the s first 6 months of 2025
 
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
during town meeting sessions this will
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to use the state's
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
machines during a year when there are no
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
other Statewide
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
elections this pilot program was a
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
result of several Cooperative
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Secretary of
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
State's office as well as with input
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
from both the disability rights Center
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association now that that
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
context has been laid out we come to the
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill before you
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
hb67 my honorable colleague from exitor
 
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
represented Mark page and I are
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
privileged to introduce this bipartisan
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill this bill simply seeks to remove
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
the pilot program or to move the pilot
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
program into a permanent agreement
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
beginning in July of 2025 and it makes
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
the necessary funding Provisions for the
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
purchase of additional systems uh uh
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
that might be necessary to enable an
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing program on behalf of the May
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scanland Secretary
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
of State uh here to provide some
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
information on this bill um as rib of
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
wary mentioned uh the legislature
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
required us to enter into a pilot
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
program uh to make accessible voting
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
equipment available to uh cities and
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
towns for the upcoming March and
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent uh uh Town meetings and we
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
have done that on our end we're making
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the hardware that's necessarily
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
available to the uh cities to the towns
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's any City
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
elections except for maybe one
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
um and and we have a vendor that is able
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
to program the devices for each
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
individual local
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
election um so from the state standpoint
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
we are ready what I can tell you though
 
00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:28.519 align:start position:0%
that this this uh process has been on
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
The Fast trck and we have quite a few
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
towns uh that are expressing
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
reservations um uh about uh the speed of
 
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
this and the cost because there is a
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
cost involved with the programming of
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
these elections and depending on the
 
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
type of election the programming could
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
be significantly higher than others for
 
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
example Senate Bill 2 towns have to put
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh all of their warrant articles on the
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
official ballot and so all of that
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
language has to be programmed into the
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
used that's a concern and I know there's
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
some representatives from the towns here
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
so you know you may hear more about that
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
uh in a
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
moment moving forward however
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
um there are we are aware that there are
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
a number of physical accessible voting
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
equipment devices
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh that are available out there that may
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
also work well with State elections so
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
that we could have one device uh in
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
every polling place the device would
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
remain in the town and they would be
 
00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
used for every election and we have been
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
going through the process of vetting
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
those systems we've included the
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities Community as a part of that
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
process um at some point we'll be
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
putting out a request for proposals on
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
that um all of that does take some time
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
um and whatever the device is we want to
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
have complete buyin with the
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities Community uh but we also
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
want to have Buy in with the cities and
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
towns when that happens so that the
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
point that I'm coming to is that I think
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
the track that we're on is a little too
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
ambitious and I would like to slow uh
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
the process down just a little bit so
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
that we make good decisions in this
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
process and not
 
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.310 align:start position:0%
process and not
uh

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
um you know make a choice that we regret
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
later because we're trying to do this
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
too fast I don't think we're talking
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
about a lot of time uh months rather
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
than years but but I think that we need
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
to um you know really make sure that we
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
take measured steps in this process to
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that what we do is right uh
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
for everybody that's involved in this
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
process and Aon do you want to add
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
anything to that
 
00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:56.919 align:start position:0%
um thank you Aon Hennessy deputy
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
so I think um the bill has a um
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
implementation date of or enacted date
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
of this summer and if we were to move to
 
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2026 I think we could
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
better meet the requirements of the
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'll save all of my
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um comments for um the
 
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.590 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um comments for um the
finance

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions question I was writing down
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
those notes uh representative Lane um
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
um Miss Hennessy sorry I have a cold and
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm having a hard time talking um if
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
we move out the
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
date the pilot program ends this summer
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
so there will be a six-month
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
Gap what would you propose for that
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question for those uh
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
cities that do not have their own
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
devices currently I believe our office
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
could work with them depending on what
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
device I mean there is a chance that we
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
would have new devices by that time um
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
but for those that don't have them and
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
if we don't have them by that time we
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
could work with them if they would like
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
to use our devices so similar to what's
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
going on right
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
now follow
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
the reason I ask is because cities will
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
be voting in November and they may want
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
to implement it in November which comes
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
in that Gap period so okay Mr chair if I
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
could just qu um just give a little
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
extra information on that so our devices
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
right now are kind of complicated and
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
almost 10 years old so the reason why
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill would not work
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
for um our current devices is because of
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're a bit outdated and local
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
election officials would have a very
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
difficult time um resetting them up and
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
doing the um programming piece of things
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
um other than programming for a specific
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
election but the the piece that our it
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
department has to go through to set it
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
up for a new election each
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
time other questions from the committee
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
yeah one more there it
 
00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:31.669 align:start position:0%
yeah one more there it
is

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for taking my question I
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
was just wondering you you mentioned the
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
the the cost what what what is the cost
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
the range some towns from the low end to
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
the high end just to put in perspective
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
question so if you have one election and
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
you have a small ballot size it's $600
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
to program it um if you have multiple
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
elections for example I heard from a
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
small town this morning they have a town
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
ballot and then two separate School
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
ballots um I believe their Town ballot
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
is small so perhaps um it's still be
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
$600 but for them to have three
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
$1,800 further questions from the
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you thank you
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
members of the general public reminder
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%

report of the accessible voting
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
2017 um I worked a full
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
career had two wonderful
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
children had
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and my life was on track
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
and I was coasting to
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
retirement uh until the unexpected
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
happened and I became legally blind
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
when I had to give up my driving
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
abilities turning my my license and um
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
learn a new way of coping with
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
day-to-day life and during that process
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
I met some amazing people who are
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
already in the blind
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
Community um who helped me to see that
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
life didn't end when you became blind
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
technology was our friend
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
um and the accessible voting systems is
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
a result of today's
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
technology and I've living in exiter
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
I've had the opportunity to use the
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
accessible voting systems for um local
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
elections and federal elections and it
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
has helped me immensely to um navigate a
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
a ballot just like the cited people do
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
so it's it's been a huge benefit for me
 
00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:34.230 align:start position:0%
so it's it's been a huge benefit for me
and

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%

that technology is our friend um I know
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
that this is going to get even better
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
the further it goes down the
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
road so um thank you for your time and

you describe quickly what your
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
experience is and do you need any help
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
at all uh during the voting process yes

thank you for the question
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
um voting
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
um person come comes in and and enters
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
the code to start the process but once
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's entered I can navigate the the
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
system and navigate the ballots just as
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
a sighted person would stepping through
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
each race or office um just like a
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
regular a regular ballot um and choose
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
the per the candidates that are running
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
office just by hitting the carriage
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
return on the keyboard um and then and
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
progressing all the way through to the
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ballot where at that point
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
I can review my selections to make sure
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
they're what I
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
chose and if they are I can choose to
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
print the ballot which is printed right
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
next to me and I then I would take it to
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
the counting machine and deposit it just
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
like any other voter
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%

and we've been working quite some time
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office and
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
with our local election workers as far
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
as accessible voting not only for state
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
and federal elections but now for Town
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
elections um I'm so very thankful for
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
the passing last year of HB
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
1264 it's uh very exciting to know that
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
there is going to be accessible voting
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
in Municipal elections for everyone
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's great that
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
we're joining the vast majority of
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
states that that already have that in
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
place um hoping so very much that this
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill is able to pass as well so that
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
things continue to progress in a
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
positive motion um we're very excited to
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
have it be that you know in in March
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
that many of us are going to be able to
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
do so in town elections but it's also um
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
going to take a little time for the
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
general public you know whether they're
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
blind or vision impaired or fully cited
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
to learn that this is even an option at
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
the polling places so um I think in time
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
numbers will will progress and so
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully it won't be a a reflection if
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of us aren't voting on you
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
know at the beginning of March because
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of people learning that
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
the system exists and how it works
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
there's training videos out there and
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
and different things but the the more
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
the word can spread and maybe you can
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
all share with your constituents a
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
little bit um as well so um it's really
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
so important for us to be able to vote
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
privately and independently before so I
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
needed to either have somebody read the
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
ballot to me and Mark my ballot for me
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more with the system
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
itself that um Fred was sharing with you
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
you can either listen to it through
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
headphones and then make your selections
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
on the keyboard and for people that have
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
some Vision they can even vote with
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
using the tablet by enlarging the size
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the font on the tablet and just
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
tapping um so it's a great tool for
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
someone with a vision impairment but
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
also somebody that might have a hard
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
time filling in those over whether it be
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
arthritis or or problems with
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
dexterity um I did include a written
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that might say a little bit
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
more than than what I'm nervously saying
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
now um but I am again so very glad for
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
the passing of 1264 it's so important
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
for all of us in New Hampshire to have
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
the right to or the ability to vote
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
privately and independently um and I
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
look forward to you know hopefully
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
extending the pilot program so there
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
there won't need to be a time where
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
people some people get to try it but not
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
everybody gets to try it and is it
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
available or isn't it available you know
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
so hopefully things will run smoothly
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions or
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
anything I can anything more I can share
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
please let me know excellent um any
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank you so much thank
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's to your
 
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.270 align:start position:0%
it's to your
left

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
yeah uh okay excellent um my name is
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
Andrew Harmon I'm a resident of new
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampton New Hampshire um I want to start
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
by thanking the committee for all their
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
hard work with passing toll 64 last year
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
um as someone who works as an
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
accessibility tester I understand the
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
amount of work that must have gone into
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
this and the concerns that may be about
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
expanding the program but I would also
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
the um that that is what the pilot
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
program is for and that extending it out
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
will give us the chance to address any
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
small quirks that might come up um
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
because as the system currently exists
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
it it works really really easily as
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard from other people um for
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
being able to complete a ballot um I
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
also wanted to um say that for the
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
warrant article side having lived in a
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
town that does tend to have one that is
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
both small and tends to have a lot of
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
Warrant articles being able to use the
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
one for-all system really excites me
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
because it will greatly reduce the
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
amount of time that I have to spend
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
moving through the warrant article
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
um uh especially privately since we are
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
such a small town and have such a small
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
voting place um so I I have other
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that I have with me and will
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
be happy to pass along when I'm done um
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
that may address that other side of it a
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
little bit better uh than I am also
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
nervously saying um and I am happy to
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
take any questions or comments uh thank
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
you um and thank you for bringing up
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
written testimony um huge pet peeve of
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
mine um and I I appreciate the um the me
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh the member of the public if you have
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony please do not
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
distribute it while you're speaking it's
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
a huge pet peeve of mind when members
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
are trying to like handle paperwork they
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
should be focused on you um so thank you
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
for holding on to that we will
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
definitely take that um but just for
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
everybody else he did the right thing um
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
and that's what I would like is uh we
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
want we want to focus on you so don't
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%

and thank you for not doing that even
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
though you didn't know you did the right
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
thing um all right so we will take that
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
and um do you have any questions from

accessibility I am told blind voting
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%

of mine for several
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
could fill out the ballot using the one
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
for all but the ballot had to be placed
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
in a separate box and counted separately
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
in 2018 I was able to fill out my ballot
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
for the first time using one for all
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
placing it in the Box along with
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
everyone else's it was a feeling of
 
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.950 align:start position:0%
everyone else's it was a feeling of
great

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
accomplishment along with working on
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
having state and federal elections
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
accessible regarding voting the
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
Coalition also wanted
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
towns and cities to have the same right
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
up until the passing of hb1
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
1264 conquered and exiter were the only
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
two places with accessible ballots for
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
City and town elections in conquered a
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
complaint was registered with the
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and the City of
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
conquer has to provide accessibility for
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
their elections many of the vision
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
impaired community in exor have worked
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
on advocating for accessible voting for
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
several years and in March of 2023
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
exor's Town ballots were accessible it
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
is fantastic that other blind and low
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
vision voters Statewide can take
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of this opportunity for this
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
year on a more personal note the general
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
non-disabled public can walk into a
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
booth without thought and vote if there
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
is no accessible voting system available
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
I cannot vote with a secret ballot
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
before 2023 during Town elections I had
 
00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
to ask someone to read and fill out the
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
ballot and it was usually Our Town Clerk
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
and those we had three ballots in exer
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
for our town meetings so it was a lot of
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
reading for her someone knew how I was
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
Voting I don't have any Vision I don't
 
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
have the option of using a magnifier if
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
the ballot is not accessible using the
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
tablet enables me to have my
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to a private secret
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
ballot it's a great
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
feeling words cannot
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
express the empowerment I feel when I
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
can vote and
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
place my ballot into the box just like
 
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
other non-disabled voters so there's
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
more work to be done we need to make
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
voting with an accessible ballot a
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
permanent right
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
a permanent thing I ask you to pass this
 
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.870 align:start position:0%
a permanent thing I ask you to pass this
bill

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
hb67 I want everyone including blind
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
voters in the state to have this
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
right Thank you very much thank you will
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
we be taking questions from the
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
committee yes I can are there questions
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you so much
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you next up is Randy Pierce from
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
sorry there's a chair here for
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
tapping there we
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
go and there's a button I'm G to find or
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
you've already done that for me haven't
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
you the button is on uh the microphone
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
is situated is pointed to your to your
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
left so you'll need to reach to your
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
left and grab it and turn it there you
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
go okay you know simple accessibility
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
that button right and imagine if you
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have the accessibility of that
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
button you wouldn't be able to hear
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
people giving testimony it's pretty
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
dramatic and similarly you don't get to
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
hear the voice of many disabled voters
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
well beyond just the Blind and Visually
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
Impaired print disabilities of all types
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
are also included and just in the blind
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
Community there are 28,000 people here
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who could utilize that
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
system now part of the reason I want to
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
speak to that is with full appreciation
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
for how much tremendous progress we've
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
made thanks to your choice last year to
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
make House Bill 1264 law
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about are we going to
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
extend it and one of the biggest
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
challenges at future in sight we serve
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
all of the population of New Hampshire
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest challenges we hear is
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
they don't know what to expect when they
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
go to vote sometimes the machine's there
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not and when you don't
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
know if it's going to be there you're
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
intimidated to use it and we don't want
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
to make intimidation around voting it's
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
too important a right now I appreciate
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
and respect the reasons why there's some
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
discussion from the secretary and deput
 
00:52:28.789 --> 00:52:28.799 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary to delay and those
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
reasons may be sufficient but let's talk
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
about what that means we say we're going
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
to have a similar plan to the pilot to
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
get there I love that striving and
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
they've demonstrated they are willing to
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
and trying to but what has happened is
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
that it's been federal law that this
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
should be accessible and it hasn't
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
happened so if we delay this two things
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
are going to happen one would probably
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of Municipal
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
elections without that system in place
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
and here's the second more powerful
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
after getting everybody's hopes up in
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
the community from now on every time
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to be there what we're going
 
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
to do is pull the rug right out from
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
under them and it won't be there for
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
some people and the intent may be there
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
but if it's not there then people are
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
going to say nothing's changed and
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're still not going to develop the
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
consistency and you're not going to get
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
their votes and I can tell you that the
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
blind population we serve and the
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
majority of them vast majority 80% are
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
new to their visual impairment because
 
00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
it's happening later in life and the
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
reality is for them they're already
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
uncertain they're already lacking the
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
confidence and you're going to take away
 
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
the confidence from them because you're
 
00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
not going to give them an access to it
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
unless you choose to say we're going to
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
find a way to pass it now is it fast
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
yeah will it require extra work yes but
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
the delay means just like if I don't
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
push the button for this microphone
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
you're not going to hear the voters in
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
your town in the way that you deserve
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
and more importantly the way they
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
deserve I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm passionate as a consumer
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%

a nonpartisan nonprofit representing
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
3600 voters across the state of New
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm submitting testimony today
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
to support
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
hb67 New Hampshire places extraordinary
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
value on community and voting and we
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
have to strive to make sure that town
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
meetings are inclusive of all
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
populations as well as we have heard
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
earlier today from the Secretary of
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
State their office has already issued a
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
request for proposal to replace the
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
existing accessible voting systems and
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
now is the time to ensure that they are
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
available for local elections conquer
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
has already been sued for not having an
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
accessible voting voting system during
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
their local elections and continuing not
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
to provide these essential devices
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
leaves the entire State wide open to a
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
similarly embarrassing lawsuit
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
implementing one forall voting systems
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
into local and town elections would also
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
be a wise preemptive move the language
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
demographics of several cities like NASA
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
and Manchester are quickly approaching
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
the voting rates act threshold of 10,000
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
citizens with limited English
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
proficiency which will mandate
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to provide ballots in that
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
language incorporating language access
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
to accessible voting systems would
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
greatly ease this transition please vote
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
a to pass on hb67 and support Equitable
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
voting access for all New Hampshire
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%

Dar thank you Mr chair and the committee
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
on Joan dargy uh town clerk in Milford
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
also the president of the New Hampshire
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
City and town clerks
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
Association and a member of the
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
legislative committee um we what New
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City and town clerks are in
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
support of this bill um but we would I
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
would also like to Echo what the um
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State mentioned and that it
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
is on a very um quick time frame to turn
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
it around and I I believe in extension
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
would be would be helpful I've received
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
calls from um clerks from the smaller
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
town sounds that uh $6 to $1,800 per
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
election potentially is more than their
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
entire election
 
00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
cost um with that said there we had a
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
demonstration at the Secretary of
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
State's um office on three different
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
machines and that was the Democracy live
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
image cast and voting works if the
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
language of this bill could somehow be
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
changed to give the city and towns um
 
00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.789 align:start position:0%
changed to give the city and towns um
more

00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
um to allow them to make the decision
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
give them more of a decision in this um
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
because we saw where if one town has the
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
image cast machine they could
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
potentially use the accessible voting
 
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
image cast machine or the voting works
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
and um in using the same machine that
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
they're already using for the elections
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
the programming is less expensive but we
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
haven't had much time to really
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
investigate that whether it's good for
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
every everybody to have the same one
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the high cost of programming or
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
potentially use the the machines and get
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
their own accessible um voting equipment
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
I mean as far as um for for this spring
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the city and towns will be
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
doing um the pilot with the Secretary of
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
State's office so bulk of cities and
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
towns are going to be able to use this
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
um the Secretary of State mentioned that
 
00:58:59.029 --> 00:58:59.039 align:start position:0%
for or November they would work with the
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
cities who have November elections or
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
anybody that has an election after March
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
to potentially continue the pilot so I I
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
believe that the Secretary of State
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
having that little more time to make a
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
better decision on this and figure out
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
how it's best going to work would would
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
be the best
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
thing okay will you be taking questions
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes I thought I saw
 
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.829 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes I thought I saw
was

00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you Mr chair and thank thank
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
you for being here miss Dary um my
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
question is when these smaller towns or
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
other cities or whatever um are they
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
aware that this is federal law and that
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
the reason that exiter and Conquer have
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
the had this was they were threatened
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
with a lawsuit yes and and they are
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
aware they the most comment that I got
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
was that they don't have anybody that
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
uses the current accessible voting
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
system so
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
so to get them in a position to spend
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
$1,800 where someone may not access it I
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
guess that that's where you're putting
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
it on the city and town potentially make
 
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
it their
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
decision I mean most mostly everybody is
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
in FA I mean everybody is in support of
 
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
it it's just looking at those smaller
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
towns and and I think having the
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
extended time to look at it may help
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
figure out a less expensive way for them
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
F questions from the Committee hearing

which it understands to be the supply
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of the accessible voting
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%

funds to the municipalities for local
 
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
elections by the Secretary of State's
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
office which will ensure that every

polling site has at least one system and
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the municipalities will bear
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of programing accessible voting
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
system for local elections which
 
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:12.039 align:start position:0%
although is a cost is substantially less
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
than if the system had to be purchased
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
by the municipalities
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
individually the municipalities will
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
secure the system in a manner Guided by
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office while it
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
is in their possession following the
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
local election the system will return to
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office for
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance and storage in the time
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
periods between
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
elections moving this successful pilot
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
program to a permanent program through
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation will benefit the state
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
and ensure that it is in compliance with
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
the federal Ada we urge you to recommend
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to pass I'm open to
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
questions are questions from the
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um are
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%

01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
bill saying none we're going to uh do
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
two uh nine people signed up uh on the
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
blue sheet in support of the bill that
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
did not speak fin the reminder the blue
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
sheet is for if you wish to if you are
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
here and you wish to have your opinion
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
you're speaking don't sign the blue
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
sheet we get that with the pink card so
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I had to do some math there
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
um and then on online um it was you know
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
it was uh pretty one-sided uh three
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
opposed one neutral and 111 in support
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
so with that we will close the public
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 67 and open the
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%

um so thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
is Robert warry I have the privilege of
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro District 13 the
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
great town of
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
Hudson um as you all are aware of uh
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
audits are an important uh practice to
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
do um in financial matters and inventor
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
throughout Supply chains and for
 
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.950 align:start position:0%
throughout Supply chains and for
election

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
Integrity uh the the legislature with
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
the approval from the governor has
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
established audits for this state uh in
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
our attempt to strive to ensure election
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity um and in the uh mid November
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
time frame uh I participated in some
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
recounts that were uh performed and uh
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
we did the
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
audits uh prior to the recounts and then
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
did the recounts and logistically this
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
has some problems um typically during
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
recounts you have teams of lawyers and
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
observers as well as the candidates and
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
um and they're kept uh hanging around
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
and um uh anybody who has to be paid for
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
that time when essentially they're not
 
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
doing anything so what this bill
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
addresses is it simply moves the audits
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
to after the recount portion and then um
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
that way that allows the logistics of of
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
getting the recounts done immediately
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
and uh moving that large team of people
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
participating in each recount to a time
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
um uh earlier uh and then the audits can
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
be precisely done uh after the recounts
 
01:05:41.319 --> 01:05:43.870 align:start position:0%
be precisely done uh after the recounts
are

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
completed so uh and the wording is
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
relatively simple it just says after and
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
after the completion of a recount so the
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
audits would be done after the recount
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions from
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you only
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
one other person signed up to speak for
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
this is deputy secretary of state Aon
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I'm representative gavy can you
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
again good morning again Aaron Hennessy
 
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state I just want to
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
let you know that our office is in favor
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in the November recounts
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't have as many as we um could
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
have had we had I believe nine um one
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
ended up getting called off so just
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
eight in total but for up to T 10 state
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative races we have to do top
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the ticket recount uh Audits and
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
currently the law requires us to do them
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
before the recounts uh if we were to
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
have as many recounts as we had in say
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
2022 uh we may not have been able to
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
have finish the recounts in time to um
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
call uh you folks to take your seats for
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
the first Wednesday in December to be
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
sworn in so we are in support of this
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows us to move the
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
audits until after the recounts happy
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
behind the long bill was thinking um
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%

introduce and support HP 340 FN which
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
expands our current electioneering law
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is important so that public
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
employees who we pay with our tax
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
dollars remain new neutral during state
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
and local elections and serve all
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
citizens regardless of political
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
affiliation this past election employees
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
of our Town's Public Library put
 
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
together a politically biased and
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
leading questionnaire to candidates they
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
claimed that most of the questions were
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
provided by the community after filing a
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
right to no request that was found to
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
not be the case they had gathered two
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the community and the
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
rest from other publicly funded
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
employees who work for our town a
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
library staff member even emailed the
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
library director asking if any feedback
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
was received about suggested candidate
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
questions the library director responded
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
saying and this is quote none of the
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions are stellar and some of them
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
will need to be Rewritten if we want to
 
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
use them end quote she also said the
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
library staff would select all final
 
01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.149 align:start position:0%
library staff would select all final
questions

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in the current law stops these
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
public employees from putting out a
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
questionnaire that includes a question
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
like why is representative so and so a
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
bad candidate for office this sets a bad
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
precedent that seems to allow for
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
electioneering that could lead to
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
unequal access to resources or
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
information favoring incumbents or
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
specific candidates which goes against
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
principles of fairness and equal
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity these public employees also
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
help in our town organize political
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
events public employees should not be
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
using government property equipment or
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
their time that we pay for for these
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.350 align:start position:0%
kinds of
activities

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
why we have other
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer-led organizations that could
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
do the same thing voters can educate
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
themselves about their candidates
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
without this kind of
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
involvement electioneering by public
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
employ employees can undermine public
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
trust in government institutions as it
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
may appear that taxpayer resources are
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
being used to influence elections
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
unfairly I ask you to vote for this good
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
bill that expands the law to prevent
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
public employees from electioneering
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you will you be taking questions
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Maser I'll try Okay are
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
there questions from the
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
committee representative Mirad thank you
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that this
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
bill um simply adds the following
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
sections to the existing law sections
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
three a b c are being added to the law
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
everything else is the same and
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
section 6 AB c d so it's the subheadings
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
ABC 3 ABC and and six ABCD by the way
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
six should be four it's a it's a typo in
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
the bill but I'm going to call it six
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
because it's labeled six in the bill
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
correct right
 
01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
now so it's just those subheadings ABC
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
and ABCD they're being added is that
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
correct yes yeah spe thank you for the
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
question specifically uh referencing uh
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
surveys and organizing political
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
activities I mean there's a little bit
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
more to that but that was the main gist
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
expansion can I have followup question
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
sure um yeah an organiz thank you for
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
the taking another question um so so
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
Section 3 ABC introduces examples of
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
electioneering that were not in the the
 
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.189 align:start position:0%
electioneering that were not in the the
current

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
law um these examples are not
 
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
um exhaustive there could be many other
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
examples of electioneering that these
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
examples don't contain so they're just
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
sort of a kind of adding a for example
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
ABC to the law where right now the law
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that for example ABC
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
um and and section c includes organizing
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
surveys that are political that just
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
leads to a specific question which
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
is if um University of New Hampshire
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
professors are considered public
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
employees and if a University of New
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire professor participates in in
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
polling like doing a UNH poll of New
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Opinion maybe about an
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
issue or a c or a race would that kind
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
of pulling undertaken by UNH employees
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
be forbidden by this by this example in
 
01:13:00.679 --> 01:13:01.590 align:start position:0%
be forbidden by this by this example in
the

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
law well I I thank you I believe
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
currently you know public
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
employees correct me if I'm wrong can
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
facilitate these kinds of activities but
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
the in it's the problem is is the
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
influencing of the political activities
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
which in our town is happening a
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
lot one more representative and least
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
keep the question a little short shorter
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind because we do we are
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
executing this bill today that's my
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
point so I understand I think I'm
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
raising profound and and severe problems
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
with the bill that need to be aired but
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
I I'll pass on this follow-up question I
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't think I've I don't think I've
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
wasted the committee's time so far thank
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard thank you Mr

chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
question so I understand in your
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that you brought up a
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
situation that occurred this past fall
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh with the gtown library and I
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
understand that there was a lawsuit uh
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
that had occurred with that situation
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
what was the outcome of that
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um he it was basically that it
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't in his well in the lawsuit it it
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't part of their purview so that it
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
should go
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
to you know the AG or whatever so yeah
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
it it wasn't in whose perview sorry part
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the court
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
system because it was in the court
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative Newsome thank you Mr
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
question um do you find it confusing if
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
two different statutes use the term
 
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
definitions I I mean I don't I'm not
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure what you're referencing the uh you
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
have a follow you requesting a follow
 
01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
some followup to add clarification to
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
the question yes um the bill in front of
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
us affects electioneering for public
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
employees in 659 col 44A
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
65944 prohibits electioneering by
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
election officials which uses the same
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
definition today that's not being
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
changed so is there a reason why you
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
seek to change one definition of
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
election heing while leaving the
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
previous one the same because this is
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
specific to public employees that we pay
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
with our tax dollars you know and and
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
the people that those employees that got
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
involved in our previous election and
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're planning on doing it again um
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
you know is our library is our towns in
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
is our parks and recck Department Etc so
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
those are all people that we pay tax
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
dollars and their time should can be
 
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
utilized elsewhere not putting out
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
information that's influencing our
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
elections voters or adults they can do
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
this on their own we do not need this
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
this outside piece to come in and their
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
questions these this 12-point survey or
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
whatever that they put out was very
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
biased very leading and there's nothing
 
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
in our current law that prevents that
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is this expands
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
that so this cannot happen
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%

Lane
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
um along what uh representative Mirad I
 
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
think was was going to it seems that
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
we're defining election in two places
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to expand it by
 
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
example in 44- a is that really
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
necessary when in
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
44 it says specifically designed to
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
influence the vote of a voter on any
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
question or office you would think that
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
would be clear but in but in thisa in
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
our case it is not so we were we were
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
people were at we were specifically
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
asked the law needs to be clarified so
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
that they cannot do this anymore um
 
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
because it makes it very unfair in our
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
town um to certain people who are
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
running for office of of the C the
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
information that they put out regularly
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
is is very biased and um and makes it so
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
that candidates do not want to
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%

Hennessy good morning again Aaron
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hennessey deputy secretary of state our
 
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
department does not take a position on
 
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
this bill but I would point out uh that
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
in 652 under the general provisions of
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
the election laws it does have a
 
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
definition for election ear so I would
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
hope that that would be um just to make
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%

the AG's office the school board
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
attorney attorney Tom Clawson affirmed
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
that it was electioneering and told me
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
to save all the information as I filed a
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
complaint with the New Hampshire AG's
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
office he indicated that it was more
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
than enough to go to the plrb the Labor
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
Relations Board for unfair practices I
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
didn't get into that with him at the
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
time however the AG's office declared
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
there was no election Heering because
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
the union president was not a district
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
employee Nasha has an unusual situation
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
where the union president has a memo of
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
understanding in the Union contract with
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
the district guaranteeing him a salary
 
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
benefits step increases payments to the
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
state P pension fund and increases in
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
his position of seniority among union
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
members in return the union repays the
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
district These funds and apparently this
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
mou allowed him to ele Sher at
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
will I asked the AG's office to
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
reconsider sending him a chart of all
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
the emails of all the union members as
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
they were District employees they were
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
using District computers Network
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
District networks during school hours
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
according to the date and time stamps on
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
their respective emails as they
 
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
forwarded the same election material
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
from the union president to their
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
respective union members and again the
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
AG's office found no
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
electioneering my concern is not only
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
for identifying Prosecuting
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
electioneering but making sure there's a
 
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
suitable deterrent or punishment in
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
place election results in a distortion
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
of our election outcomes compromising
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for four years in our School
 
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
District the employees involved should
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
be removed from the district as they've
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
undermined our election removing
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
unfavorable candidates from office I
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that our Union
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
also in the past has paid union members
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
$150 requires the union members to stand
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
at the polls holding signs Republicans
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
and Democrats Al light they don't file
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
Their donation like they their expenses
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
if they Union donates to certain
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
candidates they don't file that with the
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
city it's a it's the city ordinance and
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
the AG doesn't care they haven't done
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
that for decades so we're kind of in a
 
01:26:02.669 --> 01:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
black hole in ASA and any help would be
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
appreciated thank you thank you are
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
there will you be taking questions Miss
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
Hy certainly are there questions from
 
01:26:08.159 --> 01:26:08.790 align:start position:0%
Hy certainly are there questions from
the

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative weing so
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
your your request to the AG concerned
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
the president of the Union is that
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
correct it it concerned electioneering
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the whole group of the whole group so
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
he he identified it as just the
 
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:24.910 align:start position:0%
he he identified it as just the
president

01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
I asked for reconsideration gave him a
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
chart I can give you all this
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
information where I had the names of all
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the employees The District employees
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
the time date stamp and what they sent
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
followup followup so I I could see where
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually the the president not being a
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
district member would be immune from the
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
election aing charges but everyone else
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
who then
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
distributed the uh notice notifications
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
would be be subject to the election
 
01:26:59.109 --> 01:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
earing uh Provisions is that how you
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
would see it yes that's how the attorney
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
Clawson who was our school board
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
attorney represented it when he saw it
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
he said it was open and shut but the
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
Attorney General didn't and I wasn't
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
about to file a lawsuit against the
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney General we had other problems
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
and as a school board
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
member further questions from the
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you so much
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up is uh Sarah Burke
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
Association hello my name is Sarah Burke
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
Cohen and I am a legislative advocate
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
Association nhma is here to oppose hb340
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
hb340 is overly Broad and vague for
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
example making public statements in
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
favor of or against any candidate
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
political party or measure seems to
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
indicate that a Public Employee would be
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
barred from organic discussions about
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
candidates or political parties that may
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
take place during any given work day
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
nhma finds the language in this bill
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
would create such confusion that a
 
01:28:19.109 --> 01:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
Public Employee may not know what speech
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
is prohibited it would create a chilling
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
effect in which a Public Employee would
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
be fear ful that any speech even speech
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
protected by the first amendment was
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited and so not engage in it at
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
all for these reasons nhma opposes hb340
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
and urges you to do the same I'm I'm
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
open to questions are there questions
 
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um last up that I have for
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
pink card is Brian Hawkins from the Nea
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins representing Nea New
 
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we represent um uh numerous uh
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
local unions across the state uh in k12
 
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
and and some in higher education as well
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
um and we're here in opposition to
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
hb340 um which we see as uh
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
a large expansion of the electioneering
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh statute certainly support uh the the
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
statute as it stands um but this uh
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
vastly expands 659
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
44A um and a couple of things I'll just
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't repeat previous
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
testimony um in Roman in section one
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 one of the changes that is made
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
to the current statute is the
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
um addition of in any way designed
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
instead of specifically designed and
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
then also um ads or having the effect of
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
influencing and so that that is a change
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
I think it was already raised in earlier
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
testimony about the addition of the
 
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.109 align:start position:0%
testimony about the addition of the
uh

01:30:16.109 --> 01:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
ABCD um and and the um and the
 
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent SE uh sections after that but
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know that that is seems to
 
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
capture a lot more than the current
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
statute at least um you know so a
 
01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:35.719 align:start position:0%
question would be so now someone can say
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
well you know Brian said in hallway
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
whatever that I uh internalize to mean
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
something else which is not something
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
that I meant um and it had the effect of
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
influencing a vote um so uh that is a
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
concern that this would lead to
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
um uh inadvertent uh issues there and
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
then this is significant because of
 
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
course the the effect of this is that
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
someone could be charged with a
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and so
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
um uh I think that's the central concern
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
that I would just add to what was
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
already brought up that this is vague
 
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.149 align:start position:0%
already brought up that this is vague
and

01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
subjective and um would be difficult to
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
enforce will you be taking questions I'm
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if I if I
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
can answer them are questions from the
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you um I
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone else signed up just
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
speaking any pink cards does anyone else
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
wish to speak thank you see none uh the
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
blue sheet uh both people on the blue
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
sheet spoke so technically no one on the
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
blue sheet um and then online there were
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
five in support five opposed and with
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%

340 and we have to stand for a minute we
 
01:31:54.189 --> 01:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
did it we got back on schedule so I'll
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%

thank you for didn't fill out a no
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
worries he will get you a pink card in a
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
second uh since pink cards go to you it
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
kind of works out um all right so we're
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
going to open up the public hearing on

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to per permit representative
 
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
Burnham to rejoin the committee after
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
she testifies she won't participate in
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing for asking questions but
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
she'll continue her clerk duties um so
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to unless
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to do that I'm going to
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
go ahead and let her do her job and I
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think there's going to be
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
an objection to that but she won't
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the hearing
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
okay I I had to I had to beg her to do
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
the job to begin with so I don't think
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
there people shooting to do the job I
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
it' be so appropriate I mean you know
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
just just for time just for all time
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
sakes no it's okay just for all time
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
sakes you know just for all time sakes
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
for for those wondering what what the
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
joke is that representative Grill was
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
our very good clerk from last term uh
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
and we miss her dearly representative
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
Burnham uh make sure you get your mic on
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
but we are ready to
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
go thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um as the prime
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HB 160 relative to the
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
contents of pre-election certificate I
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
believe that all ballets matter and this
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill provides tabulation of absente
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
ballots for pre-election through
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
election day accountability just as
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
official election ballots are counted
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
before elections and during election day
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
either as spoiled ballots casted ballots
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
or remaining ballots so should absentee
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
ballots be required to be counted before
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
they are distributed to voters they
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
should be should they become spoiled as
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
well as any that are remaining absentee
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
ballots at the close of election day
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
currently absentee ballots are only
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
counted when cast on Election Day as an
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
absentee Ballot or as a substitute for
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
an official ballot Just as in RSA
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
65831 the counting of ballots prior to
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
the opening of polls official ballots
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
are counted before and after elections
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
so too the absentee ballots should be
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
counted before and after elections by
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
treating our absentee ballots with
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
better accountability this small but yet
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
important tabulation process will
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
provide more confidence in our election
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
ballot process many clerks are already
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
keeping track of absentee ballots as
 
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
they enter and flow through their office
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
for personal tracking therefore this
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
process may be easily implemented and
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
provide the public with better knowledge
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the number of absentee ballots
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
received and remaining at the end of
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
election day thank you for your
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
consideration in passing this bill okay
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions from the
 
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative yes are there
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay I saw representative C first but
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
ranking I will come to
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
you U thank you for taking my question
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
um in here it it takes away the uh
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
reference to the total number of ballots
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
re received and just talks about the
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots can you explain why we
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to know about the total
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
ballot yes so that is actually counted
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
um in in on the um I believe it's the
 
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
post election certificate on the day of
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
Elections those ballots are uh counted
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
on that portion so there's two sides uh
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
like a balance sheet um and absentee
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
ballots are only recognized on the
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
second side which is the ones that are
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
received in the machine or if they're
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
used as an official
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
ballot as a uh as for the official
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
ballots for election day those are
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
counted before once the clerk receives
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
them and then any remaining ones are
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
also counted at the end and accounted
 
01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
for we're just looking at having the
 
01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
same process done for absentee
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
ballots thank
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
you representative Lane um thank you Mr
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
chair and representative Burnham thanks
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um when I read
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
the bill it talks about a pre-election
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
certificate and then in the um in the
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
calculation you're having the number of
 
01:37:58.510 --> 01:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots spoiled and the number
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots remaining at the
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
close of polls how can you do this
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
before the election so that yeah I'm
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
sorry yes so um that
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
is that's the challenging part but the
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
clerk does have that sheet uh for
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
elections and they'll know at the end of
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
Elections and be able to write that same
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
number on on the pre-election
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
certificate just to kind of keep order
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
of the absentee ballot on the
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate but that number
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
um is is staying with the absentee
 
01:38:39.629 --> 01:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
ballot versus on the um election day
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
certificate it's kind of split up due to
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
um a bill that did
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
that um one more question followup um so
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
I I guess this isn't a question but I
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
suggest you might want to change change
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
the name of the certificate because it's
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
no longer just pre-election if we go
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
this route but also there's another bill
 
01:39:05.229 --> 01:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
coming at us with some changes like this
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's HB 158 and I haven't read
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
it carefully are you familiar with that
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
bill and are they the are they similar
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
or do you know I am not familiar with
 
01:39:18.189 --> 01:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
that one okay thank
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
you okay uh further questions from the
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%

01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%

01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
Hennessy thank you Mr chair members of
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
the committee Aaron Hennessy deputy
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
state I have a few comments on this
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislation I think it um does a few
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
good things um and that would be easier
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
for some of the clerks and moderators
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
work but I do want to point out and I
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
will be handing out the pre-election and
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
the post-election certificates after I
 
01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
speak per Mr chair's uh Direction but
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature changed I believe it was
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
two years ago now um The Lang the name
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
of these certificates one is the
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate and one is the
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
post-election certificate and from my um
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
perspective on um looking at these
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
certificates the L the naming of these
 
01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
certificates was very helpful because it
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
helped moderators and clerks understand
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
when they had to be done the
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate specifically
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
requires that the clerk and the
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
moderator both certify that before the
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
election begins they have handc counted
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
or they have counted it doesn't say hand
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
count in the law but they have counted
 
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
the number of official ballots that they
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
have received from the Secretary of
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
State and they've examined them so they
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
they know that oh these are the actual
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Ward one's ballots and not ward two
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
ballots so they don't start off the day
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
um with the incorrect ballots and they
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
know how many they have um that
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
information is also useful for the
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
moderator to use in the post-election
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
certificate the pre-election certificate
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
also requires if you are an electronic
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
ballot County Town the clerk and the
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
moderator to certify that they have
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
looked for evidence that the um device
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
has been tested um prior to the election
 
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
and to put the serial numbers of those
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
devices in um and to sign their name so
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
it does two important things the number
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
of official ballots and the number and
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
the um electronic ballot counting
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
devices prior to um putting them into
 
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
place at an election I think if they the
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
language of this bill were to require
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
postelection information on the
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
certificate it would get very confusing
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
to moderators and clerks because um they
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
would be coming back to the certificate
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
twice um I think perhaps a separate
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
certificate might be uh um in order or a
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
separate worksheet um the in general the
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
moderators don't have control over the
 
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots um in the clerk's
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
office so it may be a clerk function um
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
while I'm not advocating for that I
 
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
would say that if you were to do
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
that um there are several data points
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
that you are missing and that is the
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots use as
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
official election day ballots so if a
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
polling place runs out of official
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
election day ballots they sometimes have
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
to use absentee ballots um the number of
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots not returned um by a
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
voter the number of rejected absentee
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
ballots that have not been cast the
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
number of duplicate mailings uh
 
01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as time goes on we've seen
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
that um sometimes uh voters do not get
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballot they've requested
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
we occasionally in our office receive
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots back months and months
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
later that for some reason were not
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
delivered to a voter or if um in the
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
example of this past fall when there
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
were severe storms sometimes mail just
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
got destroyed so there's there's
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
instances where somebody needs uh more
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
than one ballot mailed to them because
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't receive it so this this
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
language here doesn't account for that
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
um it also doesn't account for um when
 
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot is used on Election
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
Day to a voter who's unable to come into
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
a polling location um they are a
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
curbside voter and the law does allow
 
01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
for an absentee ballot to be hand
 
01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
delivered to that person um and
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
collected by the moderator um so that's
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
some information that is missing from
 
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
this in order to track absentee ballots
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I will say and on
 
01:43:43.709 --> 01:43:43.719 align:start position:0%
page two um lines 4 through 11 this
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
would effectively remove the requirement
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the ballots cast information that is
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
currently on the um return of votes form
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
so now when a clerk um fills in the
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
return of votes form with the election
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
information the ballot the the number of
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
votes for each candidate the number of
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
undervotes and the number of overvotes
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
they also um are filling in the ballots
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
cast information so this would remove
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
that information from the return of
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
votes um and it would just be on the um
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
post-election certificate which it
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
already is with the exception of the
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
federal office only ballots we don't
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
break those out on the post elction
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
certificate but we could do that um very
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
easily um so that is one thing that a
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
clerk or a moderator might be excited to
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
see that they don't have to fill this
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
information in multiple times I would
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
ask that um because this information is
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
being taken off the return of votes form
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
right now the postelection certificate
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
the law allows the moderators to
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
complete this within 48 Hours of the
 
01:44:55.149 --> 01:44:55.159 align:start position:0%
close of an election um unless the
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State demands that it be
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
done at a different time and I think
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
that because the post-election
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
certificate is the actual reconciliation
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
for an election that this certificate
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
should be done on Election night um the
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
ballot cast information is there the
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
comparison of ballot cast information is
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
there sum of all votes is there and the
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
voter participation which is the number
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
of Voters checking in on the checklist
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
as having um received received a ballot
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
that day so that is very important part
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
of election night
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
reconciliation um and so the moderator
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
has this information already on Election
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
night so it would be helpful if this
 
01:45:37.149 --> 01:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
information were to be due on Election
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
night and returned um by the clerk um
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
just like in um on lines 11 through
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
13 separate information the pre-election
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
is already returned on Election after
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
the election by the clerk to our office
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
office I have you take any questions and
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hand these out so you can
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
see what the pre-election and
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
post-election certificate already um
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
require and I will say that some of the
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
other requirements are already on our
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
post elction
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
certificate okay will you be taking
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
yes y sorry represent Lane I seem to be
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
the questioner of the day um thank you
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um just so that
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
I because I've never actually filled
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
these sheets out but if you wanted to
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
account for absentee ballots is the
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
information included in the
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
existing um forms or not not currently
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
because of all of the moving Parts with
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots um the clerks do keep
 
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
track of who has been issued an absentee
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
ballot um and that information is
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
entered into our Statewide voter
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
registration system and there can be
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
some updates to that on election day U
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
there are some clerks here behind me
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
that would be happy to talk about that
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure if asked um so I don't want
 
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
to speak for them but um so the sbrs
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
reporting that is printed out prior to
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
an election is is a piece of that
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
information plus all the other things
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
that I just talked about that happen on
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
Election Day to adjust
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
that further questions from the
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
C thank you for taking my question
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
um are clerks allowed to take ballots to
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
like a local nursing home or something
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
like that and assist them with uh doing
 
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
the absentee Ballance or do they have to
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
actually be mailed thank you for the
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
question yes their their clerks are
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that before election
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
day followup follow uh so in this case
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
uh where it just says the number of
 
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots mailed to voters should
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
that also include or provided or
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
something to that effect thank you for
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
the question that's a good that's a good
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
observation uh because sometimes a voter
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
may come into the office and just be
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
hand Del hand so um perhaps delivered
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
and versus
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
mailed thank
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
you further more further questions from
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
the Committee hearing none thank you
 
01:48:17.159 --> 01:48:18.830 align:start position:0%
the Committee hearing none thank you

01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
secretary next up The Honorable Joan
 
01:48:21.199 --> 01:48:36.149 align:start position:0%
secretary next up The Honorable Joan
Hamlet

01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.589 --> 01:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
chair um my name is Joan Hamlet I am a
 
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
prior member of the election law
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm currently the
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
moderator of Portsmouth ward
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
3 so my comments are really just about
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
section one of this bill um regarding
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
the pre-election
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
certificate uh this bill misses the
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
point of the pre-election certificate
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
the pre-election certificate does two
 
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
things it certifies that the electronic
 
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices and memory
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
devices were tested before the election
 
01:49:19.229 --> 01:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
began and that the device seals were
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
present recorded and not not tampered
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
with and number two it certifies that
 
01:49:27.550 --> 01:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
the official blank ballots that were
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
delivered to the polling place were
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
examined and counted before the election
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
began this important number of blank
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
ballots is used at the end of election
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
day to calculate the actual number of
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
ballots that were cast by the election
 
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
day voters this is a critical part of
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
the reconciliation that is performed
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
after the polls
 
01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
close absentee ballots have nothing to
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
do with the pre-election certificate
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are carefully recorded
 
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
by the city or town clerk on the state
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh absentee ballot list which is which
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
is the svrs uh list this list provides
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
all the data the moderator needs to
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
account for all the absentee ballots
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
cast on Election Day every single
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot submitted by voters is
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
accounted for there is no reason to
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
complicate the pre-election certificate
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
with the absentee ballot records that
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
have already been meticulously recorded
 
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
on the state absentee ballot
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
list if you are concerned that an
 
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot might be used
 
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
fraudulently how would that
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
happen for example if someone tampers
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
with and submits another person's
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot it would likely be
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
caught in the multi-step verification
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
process that that
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
follows the city or town clerk the
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
moderator and the ballot clerks all take
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
steps to verify that each absentee
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
ballot is
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate in addition voters May
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
observe the process and May challenge
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
any absentee ballot these protections
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is no significant
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot fraud in New Hampshire
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
therefore there are multiple reasons why
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is not needed please vote HP
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
160 an expedient to legislate and I do
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
have some written testimon testimony I
 
01:51:31.709 --> 01:51:31.719 align:start position:0%
can submit and I'll take questions thank
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
you are there questions from the
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you and

Dary oh that's fine all right so we'll
 
01:51:52.109 --> 01:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
uh I so I do need you to get on the blue
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
sheet then
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
um since you're not speaking um just for
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
the sake and then I guess we'll go to
 
01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:04.430 align:start position:0%
the sake and then I guess we'll go to
Daniel

01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.189 align:start position:0%
 
Hy

01:52:06.189 --> 01:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
Hy
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
sorry good morning uh Dan Hy Nash City
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
Clerk and I guess now speaking on behalf
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire City and town
 
01:52:13.679 --> 01:52:14.709 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire City and town
clerks

01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
Association um most of the points that I
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
was in conf discuss have already been
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
brought up um the
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
having a number at close of polls on the
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate doesn't make
 
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
too much uh sense um but one of the the
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
other the points that was not brought up
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
yet uh that I wanted to hit on was that
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
for absentee ballots um the military
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
overseas the U aabas we email those out
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure that that's
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
kind of accounted for if you're doing
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
some type of election absentee inventory
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
we get an email ballot from the
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that we can
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
email out if these particular voters uh
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
request it that way so I currently now
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
do inventory my ballots when we get them
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State say they
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
said they sent us a th I count them to
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have a th we bundle
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
them up into hundreds um if you run out
 
01:53:12.069 --> 01:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
on Election Day you can use those
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
following a procedure so I do currently
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
already inventory the ballots but then
 
01:53:19.629 --> 01:53:19.639 align:start position:0%
you got to take into account these these
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
other factors of the uh uaba OTS uh that
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
are emailed out so I just want to make
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
sure that that's on um the committee's
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
radar uh all the other things I believe
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
have already been um discussed a few
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
kind of concerns that we had um
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
regarding the pre-election versus post
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
election to where the numbers are
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
actually accounted for so I don't want
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
to just rehash that but i' be open to
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
any any questions other questions from
 
01:53:48.669 --> 01:53:48.679 align:start position:0%
the Committee hearing none thank you and
 
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
then last up is Mr Dave Nelson uh from
 
01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
dairy and and um representing if you
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
could grab the blue sheet for me for
 
01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:00.990 align:start position:0%
could grab the blue sheet for me for
this

01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and through
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
you um to the members I am Dave Nelson
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
the Dair Town moderator um I want to
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
reiterate and Echo and support all of
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
the comments uh that have been um given
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
so far um and just summarize that um I
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
think it would make um administration of
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
Elections very difficult for uh the
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
moderator and and and as well for the
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
clerk um if the number of absentee
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
ballots spoiled and the number of
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots remaining at the close
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the polls were on the pre-election
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
certificate because that is typically
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
completed and signed um well before the
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
election um if if somebody wanted to
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
move that to the post-election
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
certificate that would be um perhaps a
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing but it does not belong
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the pre-election certificate thank
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
you any questions questions from the
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none thank
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
you with that I no one else signed up to
 
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
speak um on the blue sheet there were
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
two people signed in opposed that did
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
not speak and then online there were
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
three in support and seven opposed with
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm closing the public hearing on
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
House Bill 160 um representative Lane
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%

01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
session I know it's it's noticed but I'm
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
just ask asking as a courtesy um I would
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
I think we need to recess given that we
 
01:55:19.709 --> 01:55:19.719 align:start position:0%
just finished the public hearings and
 
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
would you like we need to recess for
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%

the Secretary of State for the use of
 
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
accessible voting machines
 
02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative weary is recognized for a

representative weary is recognized for a
motion

02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.910 --> 02:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I'd like to move that the
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass there's a there's a
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
um motion of ought to pass
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lane is seconding yes all
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
right um representative we wish you
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
would you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:21:39.469 --> 02:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
yes um so the pilot program goes through
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
the mid portion of this year um in the
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
second half of this year um it's my
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
approximately 11 City elections that
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
will occur and and um so uh some of the
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh you know towns not
 
02:21:58.990 --> 02:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
being prepared and and delaying the
 
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
enactment of this uh to the 1 of of
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
January for
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
2026 um seems to me to
 
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
be um not necessary not required in this
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
instance I think um it's important that
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
we uh really protect I mean Governor aot
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
talked about protecting our most
 
02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable able during her inaugural
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
address and if we're not protecting our
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable on election days then
 
02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're not serving our citizens
 
02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
properly so I think I think we really
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
need to uh move forward with this um
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's not an undue burden that this is
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
creating in the second half of this year
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then as proposed it um you know the
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
towns and uh would have full rather full
 
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
enactment in 2026 for their uh March
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
elections then and um this I think gives
 
02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
them ample time to prepare for that so
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
um for those reasons I believe that it's
 
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
prudent for this committee to move
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill and uh really
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
protect our vulnerable voters at this
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
you further discussion on the bill uh
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative pram O'Brien thank you Mr
 
02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and I agree with all of that
 
02:23:22.910 --> 02:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
but I I think we all remember
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
when last term someone with a a a vision
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
disability talked about feeling like
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
they did not have a private vote because
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
of the way things had been I want to uh
 
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
keep protecting the the right to a
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
private vote for all citizens and uh I
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
think we heard some testimony today that
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
told told us about how important that is
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
to that community and we should do
 
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
everything possible despite some of the

Lane seconds is there any I'll speak to
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
the motion um um this is my bill so
 
02:31:22.349 --> 02:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't do the hearing but with
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
the vice chair gone I had to send
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else to do the hearings on my
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
bill so I apologize that's why I didn't
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
ask questions during uh this hearing or
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
340 was I was in this kind of No Man's
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
Land of I have to run the committee I
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't have my vice chair but it's my
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
bill um so I tried to stay out of the
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
hearings so um representative we's
 
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
testimony in the hearing was dead on
 
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
which is right now we when we do the
 
02:31:50.349 --> 02:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
10 uh audits for the State Rep races we
 
02:31:53.269 --> 02:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
the law says it has to be done before um
 
02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
so what was happening is is both sides
 
02:31:56.510 --> 02:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
were getting all of their volunteers
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
there um and then they were hanging out
 
02:32:01.630 --> 02:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
for like 2 hours while this recount
 
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
occurred um because you couldn't tell
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
people who were interested in the
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
recount when it would actually begin
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
because they were doing this audit right
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
before so all the bill does I hate
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
expressions like that all the bill does
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
but all the bill does is change the word
 
02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
before to after um so that we can do the
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
recount first um and then the audit will
 
02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
still occur um so uh I think it's
 
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
probably the I don't want to say it's
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
the most boring Bill I've ever sponsored
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely it's definitely up
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
there um anyways that's my that's my any
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
other comments questions on the
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh representative Howard yeah I
 
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:43.720 align:start position:0%

02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
have a recount this past session uh
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
having to sit around for three four
 
02:32:50.110 --> 02:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
hours waiting for that audit to finish
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh was kind of a waste of everybody's
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
time and I am going to be supporting
 
02:32:56.349 --> 02:32:56.359 align:start position:0%

02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that the
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
original concept and I was the person
 
02:33:07.870 --> 02:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
who originated the uh audit thing was
 
02:33:10.349 --> 02:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
that the uh original intent was that
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
because the ballots were in the recount
 
02:33:15.790 --> 02:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
area the boxes were open the seals
 
02:33:19.269 --> 02:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
broken that it would be convenient to uh
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
do an audit of the top of the ballot uh
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
races and
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
as that concept the um audit is
 
02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
secondary to the recount the recount is
 
02:33:35.469 --> 02:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
why everybody was there thank you okay
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%

two uh Harley representative Harley bu
 
02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:24.269 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:36:24.269 --> 02:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay um and I got your guys' copies
 
02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment do you need another one
 
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lane okay I'm going to
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:45.550 align:start position:0%
 
2025-the

02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
2025-the
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
head is it does fix that numeration
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
error um once again this was another one
 
02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
of the bills where I should have been
 
02:36:55.269 --> 02:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
doing the introduction but without the
 
02:36:58.349 --> 02:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
vice chair wasn't here um and
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lisa Maser had to field
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
those questions so I will try to answer
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that came up in
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing now um but I didn't think it
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate since I was
 
02:37:13.269 --> 02:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
chairing it to be doing that um so uh
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
the first thing is it does make some
 
02:37:17.309 --> 02:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
changes uh other than just adding
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
specific examples it does change the
 
02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
word specifically designed to design or
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
having the effect of um this is
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
because the the original the way the
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
original bill was written it was
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be broad it was supposed to
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
be interpreted broad I went I very
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with this statute I went
 
02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
through uh its Genesis which included uh
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
at the time representative Buckley from
 
02:37:41.710 --> 02:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester um was the Prime sponsor of
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
the original Law and the it was supposed
 
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
to be interpreted very broadly and for
 
02:37:49.870 --> 02:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the department of
 
02:37:51.550 --> 02:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
justice has decided to take a very
 
02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored reading of it um which
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
was not the intent of the legislature so
 
02:37:58.110 --> 02:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
the reason why there's two definitions
 
02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
of electioneering um which is true um
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
there already are two definitions of
 
02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
electioneering in the statute there's
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
the one that covers the whole statute
 
02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's the one right now that
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
covers specifically 44A um and this was
 
02:38:13.630 --> 02:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
by I know that the original law was
 
02:38:15.309 --> 02:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to be interpreted broadly is
 
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature would have not created a
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
special definition for electioneering by
 
02:38:20.269 --> 02:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
public employ
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
if it didn't want it to be broad um so
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
we have multiple examples of what I
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
believe are abuses of this law um
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Maser spoke to the gtown
 
02:38:36.670 --> 02:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
public libraries um uh survey which
 
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
might as well have read why are
 
02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
Republicans bad explain why um and the
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
doj's response to that was oh well you
 
02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
can answer it as you see fit you can
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
refute the question so you can refute
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
the question that's biased against you
 
02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
uh and all of your political opponents
 
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
get to just answer the question because
 
02:38:54.990 --> 02:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's framed in a way to make to attempt
 
02:38:57.070 --> 02:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
to make them uh at least push their
 
02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
issue position so I have distributed um
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
something that came across my desk and
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%

02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
right I'll give him that um and what
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
that letter with that three-day notice
 
02:40:12.750 --> 02:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
to parents fails to mention is that for
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
the previous three elections there has
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
been a uh warrant article um so I think
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
this I think in 2024 it was worn article
 
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
133 where they were pushing to have the
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
town and SAU appropriate the SAU excuse
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
me appropriate funds for the building
 
02:40:33.950 --> 02:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
renovation so my my complaint here is
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
not I'm asking the committee don't look
 
02:40:37.309 --> 02:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
at this from oh I want the buildings
 
02:40:40.110 --> 02:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
renovated look at this from the they're
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
sending in a film crew with the express
 
02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of pushing a position that will
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
soon be on the ballot and was on the
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
ballot three times before and rejected
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
three times before so the reason why I
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
wrote this so broadly is because it is
 
02:40:54.910 --> 02:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
being abused and they are finding every
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
single loophole to get around it um
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
public employees in the commission of
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
their duties should be neutral Arbiters
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
in everything and we shouldn't be trying
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
to drag the courts in into what is
 
02:41:09.389 --> 02:41:09.399 align:start position:0%
neutral um the definition should be
 
02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
broad which is why I wrote it to being
 
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
designed or having the effect of because
 
02:41:17.150 --> 02:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
in the case of gwn Public Library they
 
02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
said oh well we didn't Design This
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
survey like this we took input from the
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
community um a right to no request
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
revealed that that was just basically
 
02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
made up um they generated the there was
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
a state it was a gtown public employee
 
02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
survey that they were then P sending to
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
candidates and then publishing on the
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
website uh I have heard things that I
 
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
have not been able to substantiate of
 
02:41:43.790 --> 02:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
teachers putting leaflets into backpacks
 
02:41:45.070 --> 02:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's true or not I've
 
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
had multip people tell me it happens um
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
but I don't have any evidence in front
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
of me it has to stop it's currently a
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so I'm not making it a
 
02:41:55.469 --> 02:41:55.479 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's currently a misdemeanor
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the lawsuit the lawsuit
 
02:42:00.190 --> 02:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
was tossed because they said you
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't bring standing in 659 only the
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
AG could bring could bring the lawsuit
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward uh we have a separate bill for
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
that to address that one the the the
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
judge actually did not take a position
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
on the merits of the case unfortunately
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
um so what I have done is I've written
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
the bill in a way that I believe
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually addresses the original intent
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill which was if you are a a
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
Public Employee stay out of the
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
elections it's not your job to opine in
 
02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
it your job is to do your job and go
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
home what you do when you go home by the
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
way is totally your business if the Nea
 
02:42:39.269 --> 02:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
wants to put out a survey of their
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
members they're more than welcome to do
 
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
that and they're more than welcome to
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
put it on the nea's website um and and
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
do that but you don't use taxpayer
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
resources to do this um so a couple of
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
things uh the gentleman from dairy
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
brought up that the moderator hosts a
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
forum the moderator is not considered an
 
02:42:59.790 --> 02:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
employee under 27 under RSA 273 um the
 
02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
moderator is elected by popular vote so
 
02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't apply to the
 
02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
moderator now and it won't apply to the
 
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
moderator after um what it does do is it
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
does add directors and people in
 
02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
appointed positions um to the um to the
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
list of people that cannot elect
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of that being is once
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
again gtown Public Library the gtown
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
public library is going to declare that
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
their Library director is an appointed
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
position and thus not a public employee
 
02:43:31.469 --> 02:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
under the section of RSA that this uses
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
the section of RSA that this uses to
 
02:43:36.269 --> 02:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
define a Public Employee is in regards
 
02:43:39.429 --> 02:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
to basically Union negotiations so I
 
02:43:43.230 --> 02:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
don't know why the original drafters of
 
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
this section use that it's kind of a
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
clunky definition in my opinion but I
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
didn't change that so the definition
 
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
stays the same except it as in directors
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
um so if you are a taxpayer if you are a
 
02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
public employee in the commission of
 
02:44:03.150 --> 02:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
your duties right you can't electioneer
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
things that you can still
 
02:44:07.469 --> 02:44:07.479 align:start position:0%
do a Democrat Town committee or
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
republican Town committee can still hold
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
their meeting at a library you can still
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
have candidates walk in parades you can
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
still have political stuff at fairs all
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
of that was intentionally put in but
 
02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
what you can't do but and the staff is
 
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to facilitate that just no more
 
02:44:26.349 --> 02:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
than they would anything else right so
 
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
they have to treat everybody equally so
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
in my opinion if the moderator is
 
02:44:32.750 --> 02:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
putting on a forum for candidates and
 
02:44:35.309 --> 02:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
the dairy Town Channel wants to go and
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
and film that and show that I don't have
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
an issue with that I don't think this
 
02:44:40.269 --> 02:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
covers that that's in the commission of
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
their regular duties that they would do
 
02:44:45.389 --> 02:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
for any Community event so you know I I
 
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
tried to when I WR wrote this to cover
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
everything that could possibly happen
 
02:44:52.830 --> 02:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't happen or things that
 
02:44:55.230 --> 02:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
should happen but the reality is is
 
02:44:56.830 --> 02:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
people are playing games with the
 
02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
statute the doj for some reason unb
 
02:45:02.349 --> 02:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
notes to me is not seeking this out by
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
the way I submitted this letter from the
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
SAU to the doj three weeks ago haven't
 
02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
heard a response so it's time to act
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
anyways that's my diar about this that's
 
02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment it fixes the enumeration
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
it adds in the um the directors and
 
02:45:22.710 --> 02:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
those who are appointed um as a part of
 
02:45:24.510 --> 02:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
public employees and to representative
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
mad's question about surveys if it's not
 
02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
designed or having the effect of
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
influencing the vote of the voter but
 
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's simp simply submitting information
 
02:45:35.710 --> 02:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't consider that as a violation
 
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
um now if the question is released why
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
you know if you're using taxpayer funds
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
for the University of New Hampshire to
 
02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
put up a question of why are Republicans
 
02:45:45.790 --> 02:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
evil they shouldn't do that so that
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
would be that would be blocked by this I
 
02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:49.309 align:start position:0%
would be that would be blocked by this I
think

02:45:49.309 --> 02:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative your head I know that
 
02:45:54.269 --> 02:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
your intention is not to Outlaw the UNH
 
02:45:56.510 --> 02:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
Survey Center but I think as the law is
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
written it will have that effect and
 
02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
it'll have it very clearly it says first
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
of all a a poll just a a neutral poll of
 
02:46:07.389 --> 02:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
public opinion can have the effect of
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
changing people's minds I might support
 
02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
the libertarian candidate once I see how
 
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
let's just for say say for the sake of
 
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
argument how low the libertarian
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
candidate is polling I may decide to
 
02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
support the Republican candidate instead
 
02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
so polls can have an effect on how
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
people vote they may not have the
 
02:46:28.510 --> 02:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
intention of having an effect but
 
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
they'll have they can have an effect and
 
02:46:36.429 --> 02:46:36.439 align:start position:0%
3C clearly says that organizing or
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
conducting surveys that are especially
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
political are an example of
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
electioneering so I think the work of
 
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
the UNH Survey Center will be outlawed
 
02:46:49.710 --> 02:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
by this in so far as University
 
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
employees or public employees will be
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%

roll call on amendments but uh we're
 
02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%

to be the case for this one um so with
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
