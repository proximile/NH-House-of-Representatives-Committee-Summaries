00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
yes I'll open quickly the reconvened
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
work session
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
we do have a budget from the legislative
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
branch and
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to it or hand it out
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
well I
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
I don't have copies and I am I asked
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
Aaron uh whether they were it was
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
exactly what was in the budget book I
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
think it's not exactly the same but it
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
um so we can if you guys want it surely
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
we can make copies of it I wouldn't want
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
you to fly blind on this but um there
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
really weren't many changes from 2023
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
from the last biennium at all it's a
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
flat budget they actually had a decrease
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
in cost for um
 
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.100 align:start position:0%
for benefits which the chairman Weiler
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
remarked on and they were saying that
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
they were doing um a really great job we
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
did have a a bit of a discussion about
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
the uh technology budget there were
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and just to let you know they have
 
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
three more media people and that's to
 
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
really work on the live stream issues
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
that are really really popular
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
with members with the public with just
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
about everybody things are archived
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
pretty much on YouTube but what uh Terry
 
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
puff said was they are doing some other
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
archiving so we're not entirely
 
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
relying on um on YouTube so they did
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
have an increase in uh Personnel but
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
they decreased the consultant line so in
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
the end it's a it's a flat budget and it
 
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.290 align:start position:0%
the end it's a it's a flat budget and it
was

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:44.300 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.030 align:start position:0%
was
unanimously

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
approved so the bottom line for the
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
whole thing I mean look is the same as
 
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
it always is I guess it's uh
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
and then the the only other thing I
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
would add
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
um was that I did report to them on the
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
division's activities
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and I we talked about
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
what about your request to put the money
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
in from the legislative account for the
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:27.019 align:start position:0%
and what uh Terry
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
said was that he explained to the to the
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
Joint facilities committee that for that
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
2.5 million to be used they did have to
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
approve it and they did have to
 
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.050 align:start position:0%
approve it and they did have to
um

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
they did have to decide how to divvy up
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the 2.5 million dollars because
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
there's several accounts within the
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
legislative account the house the Senate
 
00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:58.019 align:start position:0%
the LBA and there's one other thing that
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
thinking of but they didn't vote on that
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
because the bill hasn't been passed yet
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
but overall they weren't opposed to no
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
no not at all no nobody had a comment on
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
that the only other thing that came up
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
was that uh Terry
 
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
did mention that when they were I talked
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
about the joint legislative parking
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
garage oversight commission and the only
 
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
thing that Terry mentioned was that they
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
might want to consider on the Senate
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
side adding somebody from the city of
 
00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:30.769 align:start position:0%
side adding somebody from the city of
Concord

00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
and there were no questions on it I mean
 
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.550 align:start position:0%
and there were no questions on it I mean
and

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
that was they were pleased to hear yeah
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
they were pleased to hear that it went
 
00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:40.579 align:start position:0%
through on a Voice vote
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I told them was that
 
00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:46.579 align:start position:0%
in hb2 was the granite Place
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
acquisition that the governor had put in
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right so I guess we can accept the
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislative Branch's budget just show a
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
hands everybody okay with that
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
all right Melissa we're
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
our last big check off
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
I I misstate it it's I'm sorry I'm kind
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
of tired it's 20 million a year right
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
yes I said for the I meant I said for
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
the biennium it's per year 21 though but
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's flat so that's why we were so quick
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
to approve it it's such a reduction
 
00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:24.889 align:start position:0%
to approve it it's such a reduction
anyway

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead representative
 
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
McGuire I think each drafter in OLS
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
makes more money than the entire
 
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:33.890 align:start position:0%
legislature put together
 
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.230 align:start position:0%
legislature put together
[Laughter]

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman just handed out a breakdown
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 this is
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
updated complete so everybody has a a
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
final draft so all the others that you
 
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
have floating around in your pile you
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
can toss if you want but so um
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is for your information Deanne and
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
I will be working off of this on Monday
 
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
when we present our changes and
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
to the full committee this and the
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
things we did in uh house bill one
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire does have a
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
number at least two or three amendments
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
right yeah would you like to speak to
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
them sure why don't we start with this
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
well I don't know if this one's ready
 
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
the agriculture one
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
not really okay we'll wait on that one
 
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.170 align:start position:0%
not really okay we'll wait on that one
so

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.250 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
um is is now an amendment and it and the
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
one we passed was Amendment 1187 H but
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'd like to propose that we replace it
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
with Amendment 1191 h
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
so 1191 H the only difference is we
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
start paying for this you know if you
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
remember this is 25 million dollars a
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
year for a 10-year period but in the
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
original the 10-year period started
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25.
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
and this amendment it starts fiscal year
 
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
24. so
 
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.930 align:start position:0%
24. so
um

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
in a sense I I don't feel comfortable
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
asking future bienniums to do more than
 
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
we're willing to do in our current
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
biennium and I spoke to the other
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
division chairs about this and and the
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
chair of the finance committee they're
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
all on board with it
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
um when I mentioned at the
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
that

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
um you know I said exactly that that we
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
want to do in this biennium what we're
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
asking future bienniums to do and he
 
00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:45.019 align:start position:0%
said yeah that's leadership so
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
so so I I I would feel more comfortable
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
doing this and we do have the money
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
um obviously it makes the bottom line a
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
little bit narrower but I think it's the
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
yeah representative McGuire and I spoke
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
about this yesterday it sounded like a
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea to me
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh well we have updated sheets from
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
Monday obviously for this change by
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:25.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
Mike can probably update this for Monday
 
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
but he will have the full Surplus state
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
statement after all the division
 
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.970 align:start position:0%
statement after all the division
activity

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
Monday Tuesday Wednesday
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
and on this document House Bill 2 what
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
we usually provide is
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
a list of the amended sections with the
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
Amendments so the things that say
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
accepted accepted accepted
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
you won't see because the discussion
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
will just be on what did division one
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
as we've done in the past each agency
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
whether there's a change in those
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
add-ons if I remember the eight and a
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
half by 14 sheet of paper is that close
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
to available now you have one of those
 
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.449 align:start position:0%
to available now you have one of those
available

00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:11.459 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
I'll be able to
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
um finish it up this afternoon for you
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
to rehearse rehearse over the weekend
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
for your presentation you get that to
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
the entire division certainly to
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and myself that
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
would be great yeah we just have to
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
clean it up a little it's ready to go no
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
problem so are we all okay with their
 
00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:35.899 align:start position:0%
their suggested change getting back to
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
1191 representative McGuire's change
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
just show a quick hands
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll do that very official
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
it was a show of hands
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
you have another one or
 
00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:04.730 align:start position:0%
you have another one or
yeah

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
the 270s
 
00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:09.289 align:start position:0%
the 270s
thing

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:12.860 align:start position:0%
um yeah so we also have here Amendment
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
1197 H to house bill 276. so this really
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
isn't the house bill too should we do
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
you want to do just House Bill 2 for the
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
moment or oh we got so little to do we
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
can jump around okay so
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
um if if you recall uh house bill
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry turn off if you recall House
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 276 that was the cyanobacteria
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
mitigation loan and Grant fund and
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
originally it had very problematic
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
funding because it was going to borrow
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
25 million and then give some out as
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
loans and some as grants and so on so we
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
had we had retained it
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and I believe the in the full
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee we've we've also retained it
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
but I want to sort of reconsider this
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
because I was approached by the prime
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative run yesterday and
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
she said said to me we want to make
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
changes with this in the Senate couldn't
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
you just take out all the money and then
 
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:11.900 align:start position:0%
pass it and I said sure why not so
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's what we're doing so that
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
um it just it just puts a dollar in the
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
fund and but but all the beginning
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
sections that create the fund and the
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
purpose and the rules and that sort of
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
stuff are still there but there's no
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
money here so
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
and so I recommend that we pass this and
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
um just sent keep it as a bill and and
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
let her
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
push it into the Senate um
 
00:18:45.179 --> 00:18:46.210 align:start position:0%
push it into the Senate um
Etc

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:46.220 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
um I support this very enthusiastically
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh for in addition to removing the money
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons but in particular if
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
we were responsible for reviewing it
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
upon the retain it really would involve
 
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:06.860 align:start position:0%
us analyzing
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria plume issues within a
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
finance division which I don't really
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
think is our purview and this way if it
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
passes through the house which I'm
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
hoping that it does it will go to the
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
Senate policy committee and they can dig
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
in a little bit more than we'd really be
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
so Amendment 1197 has been moved and
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Ebola II and
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
moved by representative McGuire are
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
there further questions any
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
very good so we'll just have a simple
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
show of hands in it make it easier six
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
zero Madame Clark
 
00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
you have another one representative
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
McGuire well I think there's one for
 
00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:38.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
do you sleep representative
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
um what are you gonna do with all your
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
spare time after next week I'm going to
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
play more Bridge
 
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.070 align:start position:0%
play more Bridge
foreign

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1075 H so if you as you may
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
remember from Wednesday very
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
gratifyingly the house uh strongly
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
passed this idea for the amendment to
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
house bill 50 and put it on the table so
 
00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:27.299 align:start position:0%
that we could now adopt this amendment
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh to House Bill 2 and put the policy
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
into house bill too it's the one that
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
pays down the unfunded liability 50
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars right away essentially
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
right away at the at the from money in
 
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
the current biennium not money in the
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
comments from the division
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none I will add there was a
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
little confusion as you may recall on
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
the floor with the tabling motion this
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
is something that we don't often do but
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
we have done like the revenues we accept
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
the revenues and we put them on the
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
table I did have a good discussion with
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien to assure him
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
there was no scandalous activity in play
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
here the Senate does it all the time
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
so the bills don't come over to us a
 
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
week yeah yeah
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
so we don't kill their bills during a
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
budget year so I thought it was great
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
strategy representative McGuire thank
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
you for the amendment those in favor of
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this hands please
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
6-0 thank you I don't have to worry
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
about being lynched you almost have
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
thrown out the window last night
 
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.090 align:start position:0%
thrown out the window last night
[Laughter]

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
is that it representative McGuire um
 
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.020 align:start position:0%

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
particular board meets and some
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
characteristics of their meetings and in
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
current law they meet
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
twice a year and one of the meetings is
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
designated to be for public input it's a
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
the the this section makes them meet
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
four times a year
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
and they would really have to take
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
public input at every meeting
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay and so
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so he wants us to Simply remove the
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
section I spoke to
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
Howard Pearl Senator Pearl about this
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
he's the last year he was the chair of
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
our environment and AG committee he also
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
has a bill actually the Senate bill this
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
year about this board not about this
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
subject though his his bill is changing
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
the membership of the board some details
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
about that because apparently they're
 
00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
having trouble
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
finding enough members of the right
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
types and it's one of these things where
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's it's a big board and you know
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
you got to have one from this County and
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
one from that County and you know one of
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
these and one of those and so his bill
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
is kind of just saying to the governor
 
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
pick enough people you know because
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
they're having trouble finding people
 
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
they're having trouble finding people
anyway

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.450 align:start position:0%
anyway
so

00:24:59.450 --> 00:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
my we could go two ways on this right we
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
could we could just take out the section
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
um I kind of like the public input part
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
of it you know just having public input
 
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
once a year why not if they're having
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
two meetings have public input at both
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
meetings right so I asked them to make
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment that took out the the four
 
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
times a year meeting but left the public
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
input and I guess we don't have it ready
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
and any discussion
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none I I did speak to the
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner as well and Apparently one
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
of the get-togethers is they discuss who
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
the next commissioner should be which
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
seems like kind of a wasted time if the
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
commission's appointed for four years
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
anyway so once we get that we'll we're
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
okay with that representative McGuire so
 
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.169 align:start position:0%
okay with that representative McGuire so
it's

00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
moved by representative McGuire and
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Hewitt
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
and just a quick show of hands please
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mike anything else uh
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we have to do to close the envelope
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh yep I think there's an amendment or
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
there should be an amendment in front of
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
you uh 2023 1184 H oh yeah you just
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
meant you gave that to us
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment is a representative
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
Weiler amendment that came from
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton who's on the public
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
works and Highway committee
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
I believe they want a division one to
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
take it up so it can be ready for full
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee on Monday they just gave it to
 
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative evil you were on public
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
works you comment on this or just like
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
gazing upon it here so I haven't seen it
 
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.289 align:start position:0%
gazing upon it here so I haven't seen it
anymore

00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
yeah can I just look for something oh
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
essentially it's supposed to be
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
Expediting the short-term rental
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
equipment contracts
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
by changing the definition of projects
 
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.649 align:start position:0%
by changing the definition of projects
foreign

00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:32.409 align:start position:0%
foreign
foreign

00:27:32.409 --> 00:27:32.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm fine with this I was
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
particularly interested because you'll
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
recall that we changed the name of the
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview committee to the
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
capital project overview committee so
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
this is where the definition of project
 
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
this is where the definition of project
resides

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
resides
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
um but this doesn't affect any of that
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
Professor McGuire yeah
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
it seems I'm I'm happy to vote for it it
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
just seems somewhat in Artful
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
construction to put active law in a
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
definition in the way that this sort of
 
00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:21.649 align:start position:0%
definition in the way that this sort of
does

00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
someone like to move
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's adoption
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
awesome representative grassy's second
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
second by representative Hewitt
 
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
you're all in favor just to show a hands
 
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.510 align:start position:0%
you're all in favor just to show a hands
please

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
you don't usually look in definitions to
 
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
see what happens you know they can it's
 
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
they can clean it up over here
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
so Mr Hoffman Melissa is that pretty
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
much it for us
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
and again I um it's I want to thank you
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
to for your efforts it's been amazing I
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
know Melissa this is your first time on
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
this side of the
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
street so to speak and uh
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
you've done very very very very well
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
and uh Mr Hoffman as always a great team
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
people have asked us why we have two LBA
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
folks I've told them is because we're
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
but no we the work we've had I think
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
probably Mike can speak to this and if
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
Jerry was here I don't think I've ever
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
seen so much activity in division one
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
we're usually the quiet just the nuts
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
and bolts of keeping state government
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
going but with the oplc the retirement
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
the tunnel
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that's how we started yeah how we
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
started so it's been but we we got to a
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
good place and again as I thank the
 
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.250 align:start position:0%

great compromise and again Mike and
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mike sitting directly behind us should
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
we mess up
 
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
and we'll go over everything that we
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
took out and we added so all the
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
differences between the governor's
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
budget and our recommendations the full
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
committee so then the full committee
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
will vote I believe that's how the chair
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
has that's how we've done it in the past
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
the full committee will vote on our
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
recommendation then we'll go to division
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
two they'll make their presentation a
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
full committee will vote on theirs and
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
we'll go to three and then the full
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
committee will vote on the entire
 
00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:54.529 align:start position:0%
committee will vote on the entire
package

00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
package
 
00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
and that probably won't be until Tuesday
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
but depends how quickly we go in
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
division one or two and three progress
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Kane will have a breakdown of
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
where we stand financially the Surplus
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
statement what's going the rainy day
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
fund and we're very good I think you've
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
seen the numbers we're in a really good
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
place all the divisions and getting a
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
balanced budget to the Senate hopefully
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
what our work will you know pass on the
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
house floor there'll be a lot of debate
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
that in something that has gone kind of
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
under the radar and I was speaking to
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
someone about it this morning that's the
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
employee pay raise it came through here
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know we had a complete review by the
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services a
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
complete breakdown by departments and
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
agencies that's a significant that's a
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars here to give all
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
our state employees a 10 pay raise and
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we'll be presenting that's I
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
think a very positive thing and because
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
it wasn't as controversial as like some
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
of the others but that's a significant
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
piece of this budget to you know give
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
our employees a significant deserved pay
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
raise so
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
so it's true that we couldn't do
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
anything about it anyway we could have
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
rejected it yeah yeah we could have said
 
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.230 align:start position:0%
rejected it yeah yeah we could have said
no

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:30.500 align:start position:0%
um we couldn't afford it
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
even though the governor negotiated
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
again in good faith if we didn't fund it
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
um but I think we made the right
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
decision and yeah so yeah
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
for example in my town we rejected the
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
school uh the collective bargaining
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
agreement just recently so they have to
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
go back to the table right all we get to
 
00:33:53.889 --> 00:33:53.899 align:start position:0%
do is say yes or no we don't get to say
 
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:57.260 align:start position:0%
you know five percent less or something
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
yeah he's in representing McGuire's
 
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
right it's either yes or no we well
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
maybe if we could have done five well
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
oh it's this uh
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
cultural wow they're really turning
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
so do you have to go to Festival well we
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
have pre-fiscal but we don't have much
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
of a it's not a bad day
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
we're also exacting a whole bunch of
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
bills I guess on Tuesday so if we don't
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
get through everything might it go to
 
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or is that I don't know what
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
our deadline is yeah we do I mean we
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
could certainly talk about I think we
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
have four bills that are coming out of
 
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.589 align:start position:0%
have four bills that are coming out of
here

00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
oh it did okay yeah I think we're we're
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
meeting all three days but if we're
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that's far more
 
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that's far more
important

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.090 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:22.670 align:start position:0%
important
[Music]

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh
 
00:35:24.839 --> 00:35:26.150 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh
yeah

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
yeah so the list I have it is Tuesday
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
for exec the 28th yes
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
um I have not gone through and checked
 
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
out I think looking at the sheet
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday that we only have four
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
in most of those were
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
being moved to the um
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
House Bill too so
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
we don't have the workload we had
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
sometimes

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.230 align:start position:0%
sometimes
yeah

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
so there's 250.
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
yes and I think there was one other but
 
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.970 align:start position:0%
yes and I think there was one other but
I

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
Janet's working on the list right now as
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
far as the speakers and
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have that out represent
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
camera I saw the Janet sent out a
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
calendar and it showed at one o'clock
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
today fiscal means what could you tell
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
me a little bit about that what that is
 
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:31.820 align:start position:0%
because I've not encountered that before
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
no and not a problem so the fiscal
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee consists of five house members
 
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:39.740 align:start position:0%
and five senate members
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
the chair of the fiscal committee is a
 
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:47.060 align:start position:0%
chair of finance and the vice chair is
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
the chair of Senate Finance
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
in essentially I I'm one of the members
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
on fiscal generally it's the division
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
shares not always because I was on
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal last term even though I was not a
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
division chair but it's all up to the
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
speaker and the uh
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
the Senate appoints there the Senate
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
President appoints who he wants or she
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
wants and the same with the
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler he appoints to
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
and then the speaker appoints to so
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's why sometimes you'll have like a
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
bipartisan makeup like the Democrats may
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
suggest somebody and the speaker can
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
make that decision
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
and essentially what we do is we look at
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
all the federal money not all of it but
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
most of it that comes into the state
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
whether we should approve the acceptance
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
of that money whether they're strings a
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
tide commitments if we take it and it's
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
not all free sometimes you have to
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
provide matches or continue the programs
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
um if a an agency needs a more money to
 
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
function like say Corrections doesn't
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
have enough in overtime we can move
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
money from another area of government or
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
within their budget to support over time
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
or the judicial Council I see someone
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
that follows that closely they often run
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
out of money and have to come to fiscal
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
and make a request to
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
seek additional funds so so that's good
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's great thank you for the uh and I
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
can see where that would be critical to
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
in case agencies were sure or needed
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
something but in regard to the federal
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
funds I thought the executive Council
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
typically decides if we accept federal
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
funds for the state there's a lot that
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
go through both
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
so they may approve something that has
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
to come to us or something comes to us
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
it has to go to them
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
so there's actually kind of some
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
crossover am I missing anything Mike or
 
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.250 align:start position:0%
crossover am I missing anything Mike or
Melissa

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
Melissa
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
no you covered it pretty well
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
um regarding uh governing Council
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
smaller stuff we'll go to them fiscal
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
committee's threshold I think is a
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars so Governor
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
Council approve smaller things then once
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
gets a hundred thousand they both have
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
um the way I usually explain it is this
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
is our best guess for what's going to
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
happen over the next two years starting
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
July 1st but it's only a guess it's a
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
point in time and when things change as
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
they will right the fiscal committee is
 
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.630 align:start position:0%
they will right the fiscal committee is
is

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
um allowed to make in-course Corrections
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
right revenues aren't hitting the thing
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
they got to do something extra extra
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
things happen they got to do something
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
one last show in in that regard do they
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
they still have to go back to the Full
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
House and Senate for approval or they
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
have the power that's the problem
 
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:50.300 align:start position:0%
and that's why I
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
I've always pushed very strong for the
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
house to pass a budget
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
because say we don't pass a budget then
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
continuing resolutions to keep the state
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
going and the fiscal committee makes
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
that decision that's right so there's an
 
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
awful lot of power there are a number of
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
people and myself representative Smith
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
chaired the fiscal committee Marjorie
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
Smith for several terms and I share her
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
concern that's an awful lot of power to
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
be placed in just 10 individuals so we
 
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
meet year-round
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
all year round we and there are requests
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
dozens of requests we have today today
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
isn't too much of a huge event but we
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
took in
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
like 1.6 billion dollars in federal
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
funds in the last year that came through
 
00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:41.150 align:start position:0%
funds in the last year that came through
fiscal

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
and most of the requests are granted is
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of debate I have to say the
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
members on both sides are very thorough
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
no matter what parties very nonpartisan
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
group you'll see like
 
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.490 align:start position:0%
group you'll see like
um

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and I have been
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
hard on a couple things that have come
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
in jointly um
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
and work together so it's very
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
non-partisan but
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
again I think the legislature and the
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
Senate should be making a lot of the
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:20.099 align:start position:0%
so let's see oh yeah representative evil
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
had a question on
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment 11 19 that was dealing with
 
00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.150 align:start position:0%
Amendment 11 19 that was dealing with
invest

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
invest
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
I thought we did approve that
 
00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:41.099 align:start position:0%
I think she got scared because my name
 
00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.390 align:start position:0%
I think she got scared because my name
is

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
I just see two pieces of paper here one
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
never went into my folder so that means
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe we did yep we passed it
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
out on Tuesday and voted on Tuesday
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
thanks Melissa you're welcome sorry
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
so you have anything for us uh
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll see you uh all on
