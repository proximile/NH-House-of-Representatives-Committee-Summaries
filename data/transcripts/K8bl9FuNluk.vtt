Beth Daran I'm an attorney at Pastor
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
cray here in conquered New Hampshire
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
I've been practicing employment law for
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
18 years my practice includes even
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
currently 50% of my practice is
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
representing individuals I have pending
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
cases before the commission for human
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
rights now where I'm representing
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
presting individuals I also represent
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
employers I'm here today to express my
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and I'll let my
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues elaborate when it's
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
their ter to speak but my two main
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
points are these one if the purpose of
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is to address um inexpediency
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the process at the commission it will
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
not resolve that what this bill does is
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
take away a respondents now right to a
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
jury trial that's all that this bill
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
serves to do the effect will be likely
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
an increased number of hearings at the
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
commission this could would in fact
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
increase cost to the commission if that
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
were the case the second point I want to
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
make is that back in June of this year I
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
was contacted by Mr John clinch who's
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
conducting a comprehensive audit of the
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
commission I had a lengthy and very good
 
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
positive conversation with him where I
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
shared with him my experiences at the
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
commission both representing employers
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
and employees an internship that I did
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
at the commission while I was in law
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
school so I had a snapshot look at the
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
internal processes there it was a long
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
time ago so bound to have changed in
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
that time nonetheless what occurs to me
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
is that this audit is going on right now
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
he represented to me but I'm never going
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
to hold him to it that it would take him
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
probably a year or so for the audit to
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
be completed I learned that in 2019 a
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
similar audit was done of the commission
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
for human rights and I've got that
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
report here and it looks to me like the
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
issues that are of most concern in
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
regard to this bill could be addressed
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
by this report and so I POs to this Comm
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee why make a statutory change in
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
this regard when we haven't received the
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive audit report that is
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
currently being done why not hold off
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
until we receive the audit report and
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
have a current comprehensive
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the true needs are
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
of the commission for human
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
rights thank
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
you will you take a question yes okay I
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask and then uh representative
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
Smith also wants to ask a
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
question what bad thing is going to
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
happen for your clients if they're
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
unable to remove a CA case
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
because the number of cases that were
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
removed wasn't so substantial that it
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
that I truly believe it would have much
 
00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
of an impact it was you know the ones
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
that were removed by employers were
 
00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519 align:start position:0%
7.4% so it's not like we're talking a
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
very large number of cases what what
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
would be so detrimental if if this were
 
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
to be passed thank you for the question
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
first answer is I while that percentage
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
is accurate it does not reflect the
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
number of cases that are resolved and so
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
there are a large number of cases that
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
are resolved before they even get to a
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
hearing so for example if I'm
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
representing the plaintiff the
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
complainant in a case and we're
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
approaching the dead or not the deadline
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for me to remove that
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
case I approach opposing Council and say
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
hey we're about to remove to court any
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
chance your client wants to resolve this
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
a large percentage of the time matters
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
are resolved before they even get to a
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
hearing so I think an important
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
percentage for the committee to consider
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
what are the percentage of cases that
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
are resolved before they get to a
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
hearing so sure 7% may be removed out of
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
the remainder of cases that are actually
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
pending at the commission to this the
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
second point is now I'm going to flip
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
sides for a minute and think about my
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
employer clients who are defending
 
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
there we've take this bill would take
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
away their right for their case to be
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
heard by a jury of their
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
peers that is significant it is a
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
significant it it it's it unequal it's
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
makes an unequal playing field it's just
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
unfair so the plaintiff can remove and
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity but respondent
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
employer you've got to sit there you've
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
got to sit at the commission and unless
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
the uh complaining party removes you're
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
you've you're kind of in that hearing
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
process in front of the commit
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
where the Rules of Evidence are Loosely
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
applied dis the same level of Discovery
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
is not available in terms of depositions
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
interrogatories and such um and it's
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
being heard respectfully by
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
Commissioners not by a jury of their
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
peers so I guess federally they don't
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
allow it to be removed and we we have
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
data that you
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
know only three of the other states are
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
are allowing removal for employment
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
cases and there is a greater portion
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
that allow for housing cases but we're
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
just talking employment right now
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
so are we thinking that all of those
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
other states are are experiencing these
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
these issues the Employers in all these
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
other states and and any that are taken
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
federally because I guess you know the
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
the employee would also have the right
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
to choose the venue if they wanted to go
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
federally or if they wanted to go to the
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
state Commission
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
um so Ju Just to to answer your point
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I can't
 
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
speak to what other jurisdictions are
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
doing but I can speak to one
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because I'm licensed in
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
mass and I'm familiar with mcads intake
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
processes they do scrutinize to a
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
certain level the claims that are coming
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
in so those claims that maybe would not
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
meet um the Essential Elements of say
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment and Etc
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
those are not taken in New Hampshire as
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
far as I know but I'll chime in has a
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
looser intake process let's put it that
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
way so I don't think it's absolutely
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
fair to compare how New Hampshire's
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
processes are compared to other
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and I will just add as a
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire all my life we
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
do things differently here we look at
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
our state and how our state operates and
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of our
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
businesses and I I think it is it is
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
just not Apples to Apples if we look at
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
how New York state does things or how
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
California does things that we do things
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
differently we do things fairly and I'm
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
continue thank you very much your
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
comments are very very helpful um you
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
indicated that you had a lot of um cases
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh before the commission uh do you have
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
cases pending right
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
now I do and I it's a complainants case
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I ju and I believe we filed
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
in we're coming up to the three-year
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
marker and I think we that means that I
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
would have filed it in 2020 and it's
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
just been picked up for investigation in
 
00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:52.990 align:start position:0%
just been picked up for investigation in
the

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
last six
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
months so my current client we are going
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
to have to decide here pretty quickly
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
because we're up to the three years
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
statutory period to be able to file in
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
court my client we're going to have to
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
decide whether we wait you know whether
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
we can wait for the commission to finish
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
its investigation and issue a probable
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
cause or no probable cause finding or do
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't look like it's going to
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
be within the three-year statutory
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
period do we pull it so yes I have good
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
claim that um is this unusual for you in
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
the cases that you have handled um
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
before the commission is this the first
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
time that you've had a case that's been
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
sinting so long um without any
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
movement yeah absolutely when I first
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
started practicing um you know we only I
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
was at a firm that only handled
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
employees side cases and my recollection
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
is that we weren't worried about those
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
statute those deadlines that's my
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
recollection that things were processed
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
more um you know in a more timely manner
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
I want to say but I'll leave it to
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
others my colleagues to chime in I want
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
to say it's maybe in the last five or
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
six years but I could my memory is bad
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
with time that where I really started to
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
think holy smokes we need to keep an eye
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
on these deadlines because these M this
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
has been pending for a while and I'm you
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
know I'm getting
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
you Andrew did you have a question yes
 
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
you Andrew did you have a question yes
thank

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
you me help make me understand and I
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
know things get
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
complicated why it takes so long for an
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
investigation I mean it's almost like
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
the employee and the employee are just
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
dangling here and there's no
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
answers money I I money is the answer
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
you know if if I could implore all of
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
you to the extent that you have the
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
ability and influence to do so get more
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
money to the commission enable them to
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
do what's best for both employees and
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
employers by Expediting the process
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
provide them with the resources when the
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
resources are there when the when the
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
folks at the commission are properly
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
trained and it I I think it works just
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
fine you know it works okay there are
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
always going to be hiccups there are
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
always going to be issues give them the
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
money give them the resources to do it
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the answer and once
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
they have the funding and once they can
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
tweak their processes with the funding
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
that they need if there are still issues
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
that remain fine then address those
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
issues but I feel like if they had the
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
resources available they'd have a damn
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
good shot at getting back to where they
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
you I know your your colleagues have
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
good things to say too but you're adding
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
so much to this and I don't want to miss
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
the point
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
um I hear what you say about money and
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know when they say it's not the
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
money it's always the money
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
but we have heard extensive
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
testimony because this is not new to us
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
you understand we've been we've been
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
struggling with this and struggling with
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
this this is
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
why uh the this committee last term
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
asked um LBA to conduct a per
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
performance audit and that's you know
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
where that came from
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
but one of the areas that I've heard
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
people want to uh explain to us is
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
how the the commission is in effect
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
doing two procedures in that in its
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
introductory um
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
examination they go through
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
and act as if they are it's their
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to find everything to
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
make every decision and then they decide
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
yes they should go ahead and they go
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing again um whereas
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
in other agencies in this state um
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
there's a an effective screening process
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
at the beginning yes this is legitimate
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
yes the concerns seem to make sense yes
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
we will refer to the commission
 
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.430 align:start position:0%
we will refer to the commission
um

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh yet what you seem to indicate is that
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
the current procedure is perfectly fine
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
and so I I guess I you don't have to
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
answer that just think about it if you
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
want to um and see what your colleagues
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
have to say yeah I'm going to defer to
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
them but I will say I mean again this is
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
a long time ago when I when I was in law
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
school but I was as the intern your
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
tasked with doing intakes you know and
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
it was in those days it was a Tuesday
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
and Thursday and anyone who had called
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
in and left messages you know potential
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
claimants you'd call them back and I'd
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
call these folks back and individuals
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
and we talk through the facts of their
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
case and I I knew what the elements were
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
say of the different sexual harassment
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
as an example and if they had facts that
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
checked those boxes that at least at
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
that time I would assist the them in a
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
limited way with at least plopping their
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
facts for lack of a better description
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
into an intake form and then it was
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
processed it wasn't a lengthy um it
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lengthy process um and that's
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
not my experience that that the one
 
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
thing I think the commission does well
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
is make itself accessible to all
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
individuals without the need for an
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
attorney and having to pay the cost and
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
so BR
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you I wanted to ask um if
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
the statute were changed so that only
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
complaintants could remove you spoke
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
about um how the point of removal
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
creates an opportunity for settlement
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and I want to know why that opportunity
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
or impetus would be any different if
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
only the complaintants could
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:01.870 align:start position:0%
only the complaintants could
remove

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
well as it stands
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
now respondents can remove to court
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
after the commission has reached a
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
finding of pro no probable cause or
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
probable cause that's that the point and
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill aims to do is to take
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
that opportunity away from the
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
respondents so opportunities for
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
resolution exist at multiple points in a
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
case um before I even file a charge of
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination I'll contact opposing
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
counsel to see if if I you know once I
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
glean who they are to find out if they
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
might be interested in resolving it
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
using the commission's free mediation
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
program that it offers which is also
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
fantastic a fantastic program to but to
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
your point I think there are multiple
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities along the way to resolve
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
it and if if a respondent is going to
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
remove move that is a decision point
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
that is a decision point for the
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
respondent to say okay we're going to
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
remove we're not going to proceed with
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing and let's contact opposing
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
Council to see if they might be
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
interested in resolving it I'm not
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
saying that it diminishes any
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to resolve cases by enacting
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
this bill my point is that it takes away
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
what is currently a right for the case
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
to be heard by 12 individuals
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
from our community who are bringing
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
their life experiences to judge the
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
facts of the case and that that should
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
continue to be available to respondents
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
claimants good morning my name is Andrea
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
Chatfield I'm an employment law attorney
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
with the law firm of Sheen finny bassen
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
green I've been practicing employment
 
00:23:59.470 --> 00:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
law in the state of New Hampshire for uh
 
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
I'll just say over 30 years I won't give
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
it a full number um but I generally
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
represent um employers uh and do that
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
side of the work a lot of my work is is
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
advising but I also have represented
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
Employers in front of the Human Rights
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
Commission I have one case pending there
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
right now I I wish I had brought the
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
dates with me but I know it's been there
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
for at least a year and a half we
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
generally what happens is when charge is
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
brought in the um just to give you a
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of flavor there the employers
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
then receive notice of the charges and
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
it is required to provide a position
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
statement uh witness list uh and any
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
other documentation they want we do that
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
and then nothing happens for a long time
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
and typically it can
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
be two years before you even get an
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
investigator assigned it has a little
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
bit gotten a little bit better now but
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's theoretically then when things
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
begin so a case could be sitting there
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
for months or well over a year up to two
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
years before an investigator can even
 
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
get assigned to start the investigation
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's starting the investigation that's
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
not completing it so um I will tell you
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we are still in the waiting phase
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
to have that investigation get going um
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
I want
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
to would you mind I don't play lawyer
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
even on TV um I'm is
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
that the point at which probable cause
 
00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:38.830 align:start position:0%
that the point at which probable cause
is

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
decided be you know before the
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
commission then goes in or no that that
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
would be you're you're in your the
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
commission's at that point in an
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
investigation phase there's an
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
investigator assigned the investigator
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
is supposed to then talk to the parties
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
talk to the witnesses gather information
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
and then come up with a probable cause
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
determination that is then signed off by
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
a commissioner one of the one of the
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners one of the five five
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners then signs off and that's
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
at that point you get a probable cause
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
determination and it's at that point
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
after the investigation is completed
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
that if there is probable cause then it
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
goes to public hearing before three of
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so unless it's been
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
settled or mediated somewhere along the
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
line or there's been usually they try to
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
conciliate there's a probable cause
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
determination there's a conciliation
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
phase and if that fails then it goes to
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
a public Hearing in front of the three
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
three of the other
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
Commissioners what I want to in pose
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
here is remember now if I'm an employer
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
and I've gotten a probable cause
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
determination after two three years of
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
this charge pending I now have to go in
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
front of three
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in a process that is
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
already predisposed to finding me guilty
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's been a probable cause
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
determination by at least one of the
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
other Commissioners so I've got I'm in a
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
in Forum as Beth pointed out with
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
limited Discovery in a hearing process
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
with three Commissioners who are not
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
hearing officers these people are
 
00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:33.350 align:start position:0%
hearing officers these people are
political

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
appointees they're not
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
lawyers they got their position as a
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner a lot of times they not
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
even their experiences even relate to
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
employment discrimination or workplace
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
or HR
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
issues so faced with that that is why
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
the law allows an employer to remove the
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
case at that point at probable cause
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
determination point the only only time
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
really an employer can do that and keep
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
in mind it's not just companies or
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
organizations we're talking about
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
individual defendants here as well the
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
statute um says that an individual can
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
be liable for aiding in a betting
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination or for retaliation that
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
means that supervisors managers
 
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
co-workers HR
 
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.070 align:start position:0%
co-workers HR
staff

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
their reputation their finances are on
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
the line
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
if they are charged with discrimination
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
as well and we're taking that right away
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
from them as
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
well I want to answer also to another uh
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
to one of the questions you had about
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
well the federal and the mass they don't
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
have a right of removal the EEOC process
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
um my understanding if someone is has
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
some other information I'd love to hear
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
it but my understanding is the EEOC
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
which is a similar agency so they accept
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
charges of discrimination and they
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
investigate them and they come to
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
determinations of probable cause or no
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
probable cause my understanding is that
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
there is no hearing at the EEOC if
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause if there is a
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
probable cause determination the EEOC at
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
that point either lets the complainant
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
get a right to sue letter and go to
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
court themselves or the EEOC brings a
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
case in court on behalf of the
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
complainant so there's no hearing at the
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.350 align:start position:0%
complainant so there's no hearing at the
EEOC

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
EEOC
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
now in m in Massachusetts mcad they do
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
have a hearing arm of their agency but
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
they have hearing officers officers who
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
are trained to conduct these hearings
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
who've conducted many of these
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
hearings since the 70s there's been 76
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings at the Human Rights
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
Commission these Commissioners are not
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
hearing officers they haven't been
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
trained to conduct a hearing
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
so like I if I go to the Department of
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
Labor because of a wage claim or
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
whistleblower claim there's hearing
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
officers and all they do all day is
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
conduct hearings so it's a very
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
different thing again that goes to the
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
point of I really think you need to look
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
at the the commission itself those
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
people there do the best they can but
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
underfunded and the structure is such
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
that it is very very hard hard and
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
challenging for
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
employers at at the point of probable
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
cause believe me employers do not bely
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
go to court they don't like to go to
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
jury trials it's a right that they have
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's a significant right but juries are
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
not always very friendly to employers so
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
if an employer feels that at the point
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
of probable cause that they decide they
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
want to remove that case it's usually
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
because they feel they need
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
to because they feel like they had a
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
defense and it wasn't properly heard
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
heard or properly considered at that
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
investigation stage and they're
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
concerned that they're going to
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
have it the opportunities prevented to
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
present it to
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
commission again who's already found
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
probable cost so they're predisposed to
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
say oh that employer is probably
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
probably guilty it's difficult to really
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
have that fair Hearing in front of three
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who are
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
not hearing
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
officers so if the employer wants to go
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
to court it's because feel they need to
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
so may I ask you um what percentage of
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
cases would you say that an employer is
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
directly paying for for your services
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
verse an insurance company on behalf of
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
the employer is paying for the legal
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
council that is I don't think I could
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
answer that I have no idea of those
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
numbers or ideas I have represented I'm
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
right now the the um employer I'm
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
representing if the commission is a very
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
small business to service Professional
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
Service Company it's very small I they
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
had a very small Employment Practices
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
liability policy so most of my time
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
right now is out of out of their
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
pocket now keep in mind too that an
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
complainant and and this is one of the
 
00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
points I want to make about the
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
imbalance here
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
the complainant has the ability to
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
remove a case at any point including if
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
they get a no probable cause
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
finding if it's within the three years
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
they can remove it and go to court I
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
think it says after 180 after 18 yeah
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get a finding within
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
180 days but after 180 days at that
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
point between 180 days and 3 years they
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
can remove it at any time and even if
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
they get a no probable cause determin
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
ation within that 3 years they can
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
remove to court for trial why can the
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
employer not have that same right to do
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
that why is that somehow unfair for an
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
employer to have that right whereas
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
complaintants have it on a larger scale
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
and even if they get a no probable cause
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
determination I mean I think there's an
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
imbalance there which is why I asked the
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
insurance question because if you're if
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a server or an LNA
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know who's maybe making 15 to $20 an
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
hour that cannot afford an attorney to
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
take their case to court and now you
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
have an employer who has removed the
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
case and put it into
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
court that person's not going to be able
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
to represent themselves Pro say they
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
can't they're not going to know the the
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
rules of the Court they're not going to
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
know the laws and they're not going to
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
be able to afford an attorney on their
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
behalf so essentially the employer then
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
has the funds to go and hire an attorney
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
obviously ly because they've removed it
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
and put it into court and so there is an
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
imbalance there I I truly do think there
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
is an imbalance there two points one not
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
not necessarily if you're an individual
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
defendant who's being charged with
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination because of either
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
allegations of retaliation or aiding and
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
ating discrimination aiding and abetting
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination is a pretty
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
broad cause of action when you think
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
about it it could be the co-workers who
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
shun the person or or allegedly shun the
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
person okay so you're talking about
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
defend individual defendants as well but
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
then ask the question how many of the
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
complainants who are able to who do get
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
counil that council is on contingency
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
fees whereby the the plaintiff or the
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
complainant or the individual doesn't
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
have to pay unless they win the unless
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to pay the attorney I you
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
know an attorney you guys obviously you
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
know you're trying to make some money
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
you've got to feed your own family so
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
you're not going to take a case that
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be reimbursed for so
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
on a contingency fee it's unlikely that
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
an attorney is going going to agree to
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
accept a case of somebody who is making
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
$15 an hour I mean let's you know let's
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
level a little bit here if it's if it's
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
somebody that's making more and is
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
likely to actually recoup the amount of
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
money that would you would typically but
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
if they have if they win they get their
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees in other words it's not
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
just a contingency fee it is it's in the
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
statute that that the employer pays the
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorney
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
fees and is that the case even for
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
individuals cuz you also discussing
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
individual defendants so do the
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
individual defendants also have to pay
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
the person if that person wins
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely okay and what what
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of cases would you say that
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
you represent an individual versus an
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
employer I have not done that but that
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
happens fairly frequently because they
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
will name the individual supervisors or
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
managers or HR staff there's case this
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
cases even in the in Supreme Court and
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
recorded cases where they've been found
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh liable as well as a matter of fact
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
there was a case Fred Fuller Oil oh
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
great example um I mean there was a brad
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
actor there for completely but there was
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
also a case um where a involved a town
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
and I figet the town of exitor it had to
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
do with people at a transfer station and
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
the manager was sued as well and he was
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
also found jointly and severly liable so
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
there's still that possibility and I and
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
I but I go back to again an employer is
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
not removing a case to be mean to be
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
abusive they're doing it because they
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
feel they need to they're not
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to do well it's
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
important that we have a process for
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
employers to
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
access and if and if you do want to take
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
that away then I think you need to
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
really rethink and restructure the
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
hearing process up at the commission
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
completely they need hearing officers
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
they need people that understand how to
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
conduct a hearing we need better rules
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
of disc Discovery it's not fair you
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
can't even it's even difficult to figure
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
out if you get a charge of
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination and it it's not even
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
clear how to file a motion to
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
dismiss and we've had that situation
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
I've had that situation where it was f a
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
charge was filed against my client and
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
the person was an independent contractor
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
and I had to scratch my head about well
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
why should we go through the
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
investigation if this isn't even within
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the commission and
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
it took a while to figure out how to
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
file a motion to dismiss and that took
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
almost two years to get resolved before
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
they even decide and then they did
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
decide that the person was an
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
independent contractor and they
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
dismissed the
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
charge here's another
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
thing we're hearing and I I think Jim
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
can talk a little bit more about this
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
that that because of the the O the
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
underfunding and the understaff and the
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
case loads when they do an investigation
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
the investigations have been not as good
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
as they used to be and there are
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
situations we've heard of situations
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
where there was a probable cause finding
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
against an employer and none of the
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
employer Witnesses were even
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
interviewed that is very
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
unfair thank you does anybody have any
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
question manam thank you I wanted to ask
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
in the situation of EMP employer
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh individual
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
defendants um I presume if the employee
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
is working within their scope of
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
employment that the employer would
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
defend the individual
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
employee that is true to a certain
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
extent and not completely they might
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
have engaged in activities that either
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
were um outside the the workplace or
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of their workplace
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
that an employer may not have known
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
about it's not always going to be
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
automatic that there would be what we
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
call vicarious liability against an
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
individual defendant for an individual
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
defendant and and can I just also I
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
can't answer the question about how many
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
have insurance defends at the commission
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that um not all
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
employers get Employment Practices
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
liability insurance many small employers
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
can't even afford it so I think it's a
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
matter of and and some of my clients
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
still don't even know when I say well do
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
you have Employment Practices liabil
 
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.990 align:start position:0%
you have Employment Practices liabil
what's

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
that so not every employer knows about
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
eppli not every employer can afford it
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
especially the smaller
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
ones so I don't I don't see that that
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
should be held against every employer
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
bill I I just want to go back to the
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
question of scope of employment assuming
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
that the employee is working within
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
their scope of
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
employment the uh employer
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
should defend the employee is that not
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
correct it really depends in Norm in
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
generally if they are within the scope
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
of the employment and it's known then
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
the employer will there'll be a joint
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
representation but it is not always
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
going to be automatic I can just tell
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
go

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you very much Madam chair um
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
Chris why well I guess you me I was
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
thinking something we mentioned uh one
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
of your cases involved employees that
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
transfer station and so minicipal
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
employees are probably more likely than
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
those in the private sector to have a
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
union representing them so how does the
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
presence of a union affect how the types
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
of disputes that lead to Human Rights
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
Commission uh hearings and possibly the
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
court hearings so is that
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh so are those resolved more easily
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
because the worker has you know an
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
institution on his or her side which
 
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
would be the case in most employers in
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or does it or then does
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
the union then encourage the employee to
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
maybe pursue this process where perhaps
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
other employers employees in a similar
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
situation might not have uh wanted to do
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
so so does the presence of a union in
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
this in this relationship between
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
employer employee make it more likely or
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
less likely or harder or easier to solve
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
the sort of disputes that end up before
 
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.470 align:start position:0%
the sort of disputes that end up before
the

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
commission if there is a um unionized
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
employee there would be probably a
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
grievance process that they would go
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
through through the union with
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
arbitration um I'm not generally seen in
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
my practice that unions have any impact
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
on the claims when the charges is
 
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
brought at the commission I don't
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
usually see an impact by the unions all
 
00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.430 align:start position:0%
usually see an impact by the unions all
right

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
thanks Andrew go
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
ahead thank
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm sitting here and listening
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
very closely to this whole
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
process and I believe the process should
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
be faster for the employer and the
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
employee what's happening is not
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
acceptable I'm going to be Point Blank
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
just the way I feel and my question is
 
00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
what you're telling
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
us is and it's not their fault
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but we are not training
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
people in the Human Rights Commission to
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
do the job they're doing am I
 
00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
right I think it's a challenge it's a
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
very big challenge there's a lot of
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
turnover so you try to get somebody
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
trained to be an investigator and you
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
get them trained and they're really good
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
and my impression is they leave and you
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
have to redo it again so does that
 
00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:05.079 align:start position:0%
become an issue because they're not paid
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
enough Pro possibly absolutely it could
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
be that they don't have the resources I
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
mean they don't even have the resources
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
to go out and interview Witnesses they
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
want to do them by Zoom or have the
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
people come to the commission because
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
they can't afford the mileage I mean
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
it's that type of scenario that makes it
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to do their job and
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
makes them say why am I doing why am I
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
doing it for this agency I could be
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
doing it for some other and I I can't
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's speculation on my point all I
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
know is that there's a lot of turnover
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
there and it's difficult to to know who
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
who your investigator is what they're
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
looking for and they're still being a
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
lot of times the training it goes back
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
to what Beth said that it it it's about
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
resources it's been an underfunded
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
commission for many many years since
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
I've been practicing it's been always
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
considered to to be underfunded and not
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
enough people but I also think you need
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
to look at that structure of the public
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
hearing because again it's not the same
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
as having hearing officers like you do
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Labor or the plrb
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
it is not the same it's a system that is
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
not it is extremely challenging to
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
employeers and I don't think that
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
employers get appropriate due process
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
when they're being accused of something
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
that could cost them their
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
you um do you have do you focus
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
exclusively in employment discrimination
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
cases in your practice is that what you
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
do exclusively not exclusively I do
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
pretty much 90% of my time representing
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
employers and I do discrimination I do
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
wage an hour I do
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment um I do a lot of other I do
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
employee handbooks I do policies I do
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
trainings I do investigations so it's
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
not exclusively just discrimination but
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's always been a big part of all our
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
practices thank you um can you tell me
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
um then what
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
agency or division of New Hampshire
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
state government you have ever been
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
involved with um which is not
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
underfunded that's that is a serious
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
question it's an absolutely serious
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
question but I think the degree to which
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
the commission has given a a a a very
 
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.630 align:start position:0%
the commission has given a a a a very
big

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
task and I don't think they have had
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
enough funding to be able to carry that
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
out Department of Labor
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment they're still able to find
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
ways their structure is different their
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
budget is different so they can afford
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
to have and they have hearing office
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
officers that hear cases all day long
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
they know how to do a hearing they know
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
how to get to the
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
issues a public hearing at the
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
commission is a very different animal
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
because it's in front of three
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who I don't know how many
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
they probably have done not many
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
hearings they have to learn it
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
themselves because it just aren't that
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
many that go to a public
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
hearing and their rules of discovery are
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
different um thank you I I went to check
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
on something that was mentioned earlier
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
because I was very interested about uh
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative um uh budget people uh
 
00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
having done something a few years ago
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
that was a financial audit not a
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
performance audit which is very very
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
different and but we will look at the
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
financial audit because we hope that
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
there might be some um
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh there must be comments in that audit
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
that relate to what you're talking about
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that um that would certainly be
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
helpful for us and for the finance
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
ju maybe we should wait till we hear
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
from our last um witness but one of the
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
other questions that I'm interested in
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
is whether any of you have had any
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
experience before the commission on
 
00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.710 align:start position:0%
experience before the commission on
matters

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
related um uh to areas other than
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
employment uh for example uh housing
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
public accommodation
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
education um and uh if you see a
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
difference in the process focused on
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
employment as compared with the other so
 
00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559 align:start position:0%
you can just keep that in mind if you
 
00:47:55.559 --> 00:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
you can just keep that in mind if you
don't

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
switch and here is a patient
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
man I'm also a middle child of seven and
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm feeling a little ignored you
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
learn that at an early age yes and and
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I was a bit nervous
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
when I saw you go to the statute I
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
thought oh gosh she's going to quiz me
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
on the statute uh my name is Jim Rey I'm
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
an attorney at ch I've been a management
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
side lawyer for 34 years um and all I've
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
ever done is represent employers uh in
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
my practice uh in that period of time
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
I've probably had over 100 cases before
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission I have
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
clients from coast to coast and so
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
therefore I've had uh cases and I'm
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
admitted to practice in other states so
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
I've practiced in Massachusetts uh
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um Maine and I've had cases
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
in Vermont as well uh so I know how
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
those commissions work uh New York I
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
would add New York to that list as well
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
um as Beth said New Hampshire is unique
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
in its process one thing that's not
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
unique and before uh law school I
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
actually worked in government so I
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
understand both at state and federal
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
level um I do think it is an issue of
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
underfunding uh you've got um a limited
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
number of investigators you've got over
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
200 cases filed a year they've got to
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
get through the process uh and they take
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
the job very seriously there is high
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
turnover as Andrea said um I I was I
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
made a note when it when the there was a
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
mention of cases that at the commission
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh the oldest case of Mayor 22 I'm going
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to confirm and I'll I'll
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
I'll send it back to the the committee
 
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
I'm certain I have cases that are older
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
than May of 22 that are still sitting at
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
the commission I'm certain of it I've
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
got about six or seven Active cases
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
there now I have a motion to dismiss
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
pending there now uh a jurisdictional
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
question um but uh the other thing I
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
want to mention very quickly is the
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
issue of probable cause probable cause
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
is a 51% standard more probable than not
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about uh a
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
certainty that the employer is
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
responsible or that a certainty it flip
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
it to the other side that there is no
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
value to the individuals case that
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're bringing forward it's
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
51% and that's a that's a best guess
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
based upon you know this the old
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
standard of he said she said or he said
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
he said and so on sometimes there aren't
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and it's who's more believable
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
what circumstances lead to that 51% and
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
yes it's blessed by a commissioner but
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's after a per of years years and to
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
Andrea's Point I've had several cases uh
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
recently where unfortunately my side the
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
employer side wasn't spoken to it was
 
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
based upon the initial response which is
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
now a couple of years later and didn't
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
speak to our Witnesses and that's a
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
that's a sense of fairness now that's
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
not to disparage anyone at the
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
commission that is a due process
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
question and uh if the the individual
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
can remove after 180 days now remember
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
that the time to file with the
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
commission just like with the EOC is
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
within 180 days of the last event of
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination the bad act so it's meant
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
to move the process
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
along and it's 300 days if it's a dual
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
filing with the EEOC but EEOC pushes it
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
back to the state and says you do the
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
work first so it sits there now under
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
the funding arrangement with the with
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
the commission it's my understanding
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
that cases are supposed to be resolved
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
within two years three years under the
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
statute adjudication within three years
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
I've had many cases and I can I can
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
speak with some prec
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
over the years and it's not unique to
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
the current uh executive director uh
 
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
that are older than 3 years they do
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
their best but there is a limited staff
 
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
I remember it wasn't that long ago where
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature in a way to somehow move
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
things along took away the funding for
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
the copy machine for the Human Rights
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
Commission and so both sides had to
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
produce their own copies uh Andrea
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned it is a funding issue it is a
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
process issue but it's a system that is
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
meant to be a clearing house you can't
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
have a clearing house if you say you've
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
got a file within 6 to 9 months and you
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
hope that you can get it resolved within
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
two to three years and you're out at the
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
outer limits of that and even then
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
Witnesses fade Witnesses uh relocate and
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
again you haven't perhaps spoken to some
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
witnesses and there's a probable cause
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
finding if you take
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
away the right for the employer at that
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
point as Andrea said that we just simply
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
don't think this is fair yeah a lot of
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
cases are resolved you can talk to the
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
the judges in our federal court and they
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
say you very rarely have a jury trial in
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
these cases because it doesn't make a
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
lot of sense and that's that's down the
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
road but in in some cases absolutely go
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
forward that that it was a 51% standard
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
we disagree with it and we think if
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's another opportunity for review
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
of the facts and the evidence and a more
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
involved Discovery process that that
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
Justice will be served and you know you
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
may have heard it if you watched the
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
debate last night if you had the
 
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
tolerance for the yelling back and forth
 
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.109 align:start position:0%
tolerance for the yelling back and forth
but

00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
one of the candidates said Justice
 
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
delayed is Justice denied and that truly
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
is the case here for both sides for both
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
sides for the individual who files that
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
claim waiting two and three years for
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
resolution and the same is true with
 
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
regard to the employer side uh so uh
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative Andre you you said it
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
before that the delay in the system is
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
not uh serving either side I absolutely
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
agree with that uh so I think the answer
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
is in connection with the audit let's do
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
invest in making that the more efficient
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
system investing in uh I would say it
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily having better hearings
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
officers because it also has to be
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
investing at the in in at the
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
investigative stage for purposes of
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
determining the facts in the case and
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
coming to some recommendation or
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
resolution so um I I I don't want to go
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of time on this I
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
think on the card it said three minutes
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's been a multiple of that so uh any
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
questions otherwise I'll I can conclude
 
00:53:55.559 --> 00:53:57.309 align:start position:0%
questions otherwise I'll I can conclude
my

00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
testimony Madam chair of course I just
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
want to knowe that is our fault not
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
yours that you've been up here longer
 
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.710 align:start position:0%
yours that you've been up here longer
than

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
that it all depends on how you
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately come out with your
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
report it will be perfect as it
 
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
always does anybody have any questions
 
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.230 align:start position:0%
always does anybody have any questions
for

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
anybody thank you all for coming
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
out but
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
I if you were sitting where we're
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
sitting and you wanted to make sure that
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
the system worked the way we all would
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
hope it worked in a fair and timely
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
way are there changes other than
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
money that you would like to
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
but frequently we find that it's easiest
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
to say if we gave them more money they
 
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.190 align:start position:0%
to say if we gave them more money they
would

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
do um the job but that's not always true
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
um in that it might be that the money
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
that they have for example isn't being
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
spent in the most um effective and
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
helpful way um and we we want to do the
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
right thing the Judiciary Committee in
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
the house has struggled with this issue
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
for at the current phase at least two
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
terms um but I think more than that and
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
um we haven't gotten it right yet and uh
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
so we need your help and I hope you will
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
be honest with us and
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
not feel the
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.349 align:start position:0%
not feel the
need

00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll be honest with us thank
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
you representative I have a very quick
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
answer uh it's tied to a couple of
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
things one is rarely am I given the I've
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
been married for 34 years and I conceded
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
all authority 34 years ago I don't get
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
to make many decisions except in my
 
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
workplace and I will say this under the
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
statute in all seriousness what I would
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
say is
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
consequences if there's going to be a
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
change I would say two things having
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
consequences for if the case is not
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
resolved within a designated period of
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
time there are consequences and
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
similarly the other side of it is the
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
individual the plaintiff side can remove
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
the case after 180 days well then why
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
not allow the employer to remove it and
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
that would say you either you get to it
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
or we've got an opportunity we can go to
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
court so with so it because under the
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
wage statute you have an opportunity to
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
go to the Department of Labor or the
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
superior court and there's an election
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
there so I think if it can't be resolved
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
by the clearing house within 180 days
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
either party can
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
remove or if in the alternative and I
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
actually think that's a lesser
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
alternative it has to be resolved within
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
three years and if not then there are
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
some consequences and I don't think I
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't like that because then neither
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
party is Ser by a dismissal at that
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
point so I think the better choice would
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
be after 180 days if the if the the
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
agency has not an opportunity to get to
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
that and that could be based on a
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
performance audit too then either party
 
00:57:18.839 --> 00:57:23.789 align:start position:0%
performance audit too then either party
can

00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
remove um I think that's an excellent
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
question we can look at other uh
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
departments in New Hampshire where the
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
process does seem to be working and
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that employers are
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes not happy with the response
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
they get from a wage and hour claim at
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor or an
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment claim at the Department of
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
Employment Security but those processes
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
seem to be working smoothly in in a way
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
where the employer and the
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
individual um both have the opportunity
 
00:58:06.029 --> 00:58:06.039 align:start position:0%
to to state their um points of view in a
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
way that a a fair judgment is
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
rendered I don't know how one goes about
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
implementing that type of system within
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
the commission it's it's it's not a
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
state department it's it's a commission
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
with an executive director but I think
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
there is a blueprint that exists here
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to set up a process that
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
is fair to both the individual and the
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
employer you may thank you Mr juv it's
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
always nice to hear from you um and I'd
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
like that to go on forever and ever as
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.789 align:start position:0%
um the
um

00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
Unemployment uh area has different
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
funding um and so you know the
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
money comes um uh to that agency in a
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
way that isn't restricted by the
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
careful um review of the legislature and
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
so you know eliminate that but not
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's not so for the Department of
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
Labor Department of Labor is very much
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
the same as here um my question goes
 
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
back to probable cause which we
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
recognize is just the basic
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
barrier I
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't understand and I need you to help
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
me understand
 
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.789 align:start position:0%
me understand
why

00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
the getting first to getting to the
 
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.430 align:start position:0%
the getting first to getting to the
Starting

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
Starting
 
00:59:46.829 --> 00:59:46.839 align:start position:0%
Gate of examining probable cause takes
 
00:59:46.839 --> 00:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
Gate of examining probable cause takes
so

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
long in the commission and why the
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
finding of probable C or not takes
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
equally long before we get to the point
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
where the Commissioners or the
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate number of Commissioners in
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
investigate and make a determination on
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
the final
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
outcome I don't
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
understand the time I have to confess to
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
you that I was the first staff member of
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
the equal employment opportunity
 
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
commission which gives you some idea of
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
how old I am um I was of course four
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
years old at the time um but
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh the problem always was if you waited
 
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.549 align:start position:0%
uh the problem always was if you waited
too

01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
long no one
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
wins it's not just the financial cost
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's the emotional cost and the
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
institutional cost and whatever why do
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
you think it takes so long to even
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
get to the starting gate
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
before the investigative process for um
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
probable cause goes
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
on let let me start and then I'll pass
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
it on thank you Mr sh I do believe it's
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
a resource issue it's no different than
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
if you were a
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
CPA and you're uh handled uh your
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
clients's tax returns and you recognize
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
that they need to be in by April 15th
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
takes two hours per return to do it and
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
you uh on April 14th are handed 200
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
returns to complete you don't have the
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
resources to get those done in in the
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of time and it also
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
forces I think because of that the
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
investigators to
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
um not be able to give as much attention
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
to all sides during the investigative
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
process before they render a decision
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
because they've got to churn these out
 
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
and get to the and get to the next one
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
and then the third issue I think is that
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
the The Rules of Evidence are lighter
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
and different than what exists in in a
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
court situation so I think all of those
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
contribute to the issue but let me uh
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
have my colleagues
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
comment I thank you for the question I I
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
agree with Mr juv I think it is mainly a
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
resource issue so you know the
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
complaints filed the response is filed
 
01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
by the employer and then it s it has
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
been sitting there for a lengthy period
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
of time before even an investigator is
 
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
assigned and an investigation begins
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's been in the most
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
most Rec recent past it used to be the
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
case that once the response was
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
filed maybe maybe even within a few
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
months you'd receive a letter from the
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
commission saying an investigator has
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
been assigned this investigator will be
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
in touch with you regarding the
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
investigation and so forth and an
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
investigation would take place um that I
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
mean that process was working um you
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
know from a few years ago and I just
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
want to add on to attorney re's comment
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
and I I think um attorney Chatfield also
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is a motion practice at
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
the commission too so the commission is
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
also handling motions to dismiss um
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
motions for finding of joint employer
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
there are other legal issues that come
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
up um during the adjudication process
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
and so they are receiving these motions
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
that need to be reviewed legal analysis
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and they need to be
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
ruled on that's a whole I have no idea
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
idea how active folks are in that but I
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
know I'm pretty active with those issues
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
and filing motions so there's that
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
component as well that the commission is
 
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.710 align:start position:0%
um you know
considering

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
EXC I I think in answering uh
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's question I think
 
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
about it as I'm sitting here and and my
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
licking about my experience over the
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
years with with different agencies in
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination harassment cases are so
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
much more
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
complex than you know and I'm not I'm
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
not saying that they're really simple
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
but an unemployment hearing is the the
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
issue is more discreet wage claims the
 
01:04:42.029 --> 01:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
issue is more discreet when you're
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with harassment discrimination
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
cases they are invariably
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
extremely complex so the investigations
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
do take longer so if you have a hearing
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
if you have an investigator who's
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with however many cases they
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
have or investigations they're dealing
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
each one is probably fairly complex so
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a longer time before
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
they can get to the next case so that's
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
why this I think partially to do it is a
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
resource issue we obviously don't have
 
01:05:12.359 --> 01:05:13.549 align:start position:0%
resource issue we obviously don't have
enough

01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
investigators to get through these cases
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
to get through that investigation phase
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
so that you get to a probable cause
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
phase sooner rather than later and again
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
I think they're trying and I think
 
01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's why we're seeing a lot more of
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
these streamlined investigations where
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
they're not even doing interviews of
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
people of witnesses so it's it there's
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
got to be an understanding on whoever
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
the legislator's understanding is that
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
harassment discrimination cases are far
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
more complex and the investigation stage
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
does need to be properly resourced in
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
order to do that to get to a probable
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
cause finding and and it's not just a
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
basic finding it's a finding like more
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
than likely than not they're guilty
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
predisposing people to thinking oh that
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
employer's already been you know found
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
guilty but we still have to go through a
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing about it so I really
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a matter of getting resources
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
and understanding and respecting the
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
investigation phase needing to be really
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
resources let me ask one question and
 
01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
this is just an idea that I just came up
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
with so I haven't really discussed it
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
before but I what I'm hearing from you
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
is the concern about if we don't pull
 
01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
out before you know the three-year Mark
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
then there wouldn't be an opportunity to
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
have a jury trial yes you could appeal a
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
decision if it went forward with a you
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
know before the you know for a formal um
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
hearing but you wouldn't be able to have
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
a jury trial at that point you'd just be
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
going through the appeals
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
process um what if there was mandatory
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
mediation first and there
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
was nobody you know you were unable to
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
reach a settlement at that point that it
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
could be removed but that at least we
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
first that's actually the system right
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
now if there's a probable cause finding
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
if there's a probable cause finding uh
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's set down for a hearing before the
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
commission but the parties are supposed
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
to submit to conciliation first and if
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
conciliation fails then the the
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
respondent employer can remove it to
 
01:07:23.279 --> 01:07:24.549 align:start position:0%
respondent employer can remove it to
court

01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
this proposed change would take that
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
right away
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
well no because right now you can remove
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
it after 180 days so no mediation at all
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
may have even happened the plaintiffs
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
can remove after 108 days the employer
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
cannot any party can remove no the
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
employer can't remove until after a
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding the
 
01:07:44.359 --> 01:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding the
Lang

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
Lang
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
so that too the language says that any
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
party aggrieved by a violation of the
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
statute can remove after 80 Days that's
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
complainant okay but what if they could
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
what if what if we couldn't remove until
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
after if if the employe like kind of
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
meeting in the middle here what if the
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
employer can't remove until after
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
conciliation like after there's been an
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
now so this I have a case right now that
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
has a probable cause finding against it
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're set down for a public Hearing in
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
in um January or February and we have a
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
conciliation coming up uh in two weeks
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
and we have to go through that process
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
and if the ma matter doesn't settle we
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to remove the
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
matter to court or proceed to a hearing
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
so but I thought that after there had
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
been a probable cause finding that you
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
could remove and so you didn't have to
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
go through conciliation first is which
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
of those is
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.590 align:start position:0%
of those is
true

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
conciliation process is something that
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
we're required to
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
do before removing because I don't the
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
statue states that I I can say this uh
 
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
I've in my career I've had a handful of
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
probable cause findings I've had
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
probably three or four uh out of all
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
those cases I've handled so okay so then
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
you would have no problem if there had
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
to be conciliation first because that's
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
the way that you guys are all currently
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
anyway I have no problem with the
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
conciliation first I think but then as
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
long as I have the opportunity to remove
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
the court to court if it's not resolved
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
you does anybody else have any the
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
announ attorney REI I just wanted to ask
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
you you said that the commission is
 
01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
meant to be a clearing house and I just
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear more about your thoughts
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
on that and what you meant by that I go
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
back to the legislative history thank
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
you for the question I uh and and uh
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith knows this as well
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
at work at the EEOC EEOC is intended to
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
be a clearing house as well it's it's a
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
protective statute uh it's meant to that
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
the parties can uh the uh individual can
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for the
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
individual to bring forward a a
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
complaint uh again within that period of
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
time seasonable period of time and the
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
commission instead of going directly to
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
court the commission can do I think what
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
it was referred to at the EEOC was the
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
three bin
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
system no probable cause or probably
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
easily dismissed we need to investigate
 
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit this looks bad and the EOC
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
might get involved to uh for purposes of
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
um that's effectively what the so the
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission sort of has the
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
same model purpose of one does this fit
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
within our jurisdiction two did the
 
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
facts support the case and then but
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's where the system's been breaking
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
down uh that one it's a long delay to
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
get to that decision whether it's
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
probable cause or not and the other is
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
how that how that works and whether or
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
not Witnesses have been spoken to so it
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
is meant to be a clearing house uh
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
cases anybody
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
else thank you all I appreciate you
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
um director Malaki if you don't mind
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
coming up for a few I just wanted to
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
clarify a few things and then we can um
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
have um our other group come up I just
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
so uh you had confirmed this morning
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
that the oldest case was was uh May of
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
2022 that's the oldest case pending is
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
that correct correct okay so we just
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
heard from two attorneys who are stating
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
that they have ones open from older do
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
we think that what do we think is the
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
discrepancy there so thank you very much
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
for the question question good morning
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
everyone um so there are a couple of
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
things here and if you are not confused
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
by all of that then you're smarter than
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
me um could you move the microphone
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
closer to sure absolutely thank
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
you so there are quite a few things that
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
were brought up in the previous uh
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
offerings of testimony um bits and
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
pieces are correct bits and pieces are
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
not um but to answer your specific
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
question that is the oldest waiting case
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
or pending case to be assigned are there
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
cases um that might be a little older
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
than that that are currently assigned to
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
someone yes um I think one of the
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys mentioned a case but that case
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
was uh filed in 2021 and that case has
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
been assigned um so that would basically
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
be two years or a little more than two
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
years however the pending cases that we
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
have now are less than two years so the
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
progress is being made to have cases
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
waiting less time than they had been in
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
the past and that is uh due to quite a
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
few things but the most important thing
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
would be the updating uh in terms of the
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
efficiency of our um investigative
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
process so I could certainly speak more
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
about that but I I can certain I can
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
answer specific questions if you
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
prefer thank you for being here it must
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
not be the most Pleasant way to to start
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
your your morning I understand cuz
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's so much involved here um I'm a
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
little confused by what you just said
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
for me a pending case is a case that has
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
not yet had the final
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
decision made to me that would be any
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
case that hasn't been completely
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
finished and
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
closed I did I I misunderstand you I had
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
the impression that what you were saying
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
is that you viewed pending case you
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
might view pending cases as those that
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
haven't yet entered the
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
process that is correct so a case that
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
is pending is waiting to be assigned to
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
an investigator once the investigator is
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
assigned it is actively being
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
investigated but the question isn't to
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
me whether a case has been assigned to
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
an investigator or not the question to
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
me is to whether the case has been
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
resolved and I
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
wonder um if you can give me an example
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
of any other
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
situation in which pending refers to the
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
time it takes to get to the starting
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
gate rather than then the time it takes
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
to get across the Finish Line I
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um I'm not able to speak
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
eloquently on other departments or
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
agencies or the court or whatever they
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
do that's not my area of expertise uh
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
what I can say historically appending
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
case is one that is waiting to be
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
assigned that's the way I've been uh
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
that's the conversation we've had over
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
the last five years when I've been
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
providing testimony it's what we talked
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
about last summer it's what we've talked
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
about last session and it has always
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
remained the same a pending case we we
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
differentiate between pending and active
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
investigation now it is a different
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
conversation if your if your
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a pending case is
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
a case that has not been resolved that's
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
a different conversation that's not the
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
conversation that I've been having so if
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
I've misled you in some way or there's
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
some confusion there I can certainly
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but I I feel that
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
I've been pretty clear pending is
 
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
waiting to be
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
assigned thank you I believe in learning
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
something new every day and this is new
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
for me so thank you for
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
that so I guess my follow-up question
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be what is the oldest case that
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
has not reached resolution I don't have
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
an answer for that right now I'd have to
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
talk to the investigators to see uh what
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
they have I know that we are um we have
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
been assigning out of
 
01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
2022 so as far as I know it's 2022 could
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
there be well obviously there's a 2021
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
case um because that's one of what uh
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
something one of the attorneys said but
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
I would have to check and see if there's
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
something older or specifically what
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
month I would have to find that that
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
information out um and something
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
important that's a part of the process I
 
01:16:38.629 --> 01:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
think that we have missed in this
 
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
conversation because we've been having
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
15 different conversations at once right
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
so we've talked about the process we've
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
talked about jury of our peers not jury
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
of jury of our peers what uh mcad does
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts what Connecticut does
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
what Rhode Island does what a variety of
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
other states do but I think the part
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
that we have missed in all of this and
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
truly at the end of the day whatever you
 
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
decide is what you decide we're going to
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
come to work and and do a very good job
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether respondents are
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
retained with us or they are allowed to
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
continue to remove after probable cause
 
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
however this this whole process
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
basically started with the 1964 Civil
 
01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
Rights Act and the whole point of that
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
act relative to discrimin ation was to
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
give the aggrieved party so the person
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
who perceives that they've been
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
discriminated against a fair opportunity
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
to bring a charge of discrimination
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
against whether it's an employer um and
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
for this State education is included
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's a place of public
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation that's a hotel or um a
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
restaurant or if it's a housing
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
situation and
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
so is the is the process weighted a
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
little more to make it easier for the
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
for the complainant absolutely Ely
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
because the majority of them are not
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to be represented by Council and
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
so where this conversation sort of picks
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
up is that it could be seen as
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
retaliatory if once the case has been uh
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
determined that there's probable cause
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
and probable cause is not a more likely
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
than not standard so that was incorrect
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
that standard is what happens at the
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
hearing at probable cause we are
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
determining that that there could be
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
something there's there's enough of
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
something here that there could be um
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination that's taking place and
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
then the hearing officials will then
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
make the determination if there has been
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh there they have the more likely than
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
not standard um and to I guess someone
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
else's point um the last two hearings
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
we've had have not gone in the direction
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
of the complaintant so I think in terms
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
of hearings uh there's a balance there
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
right and the investigate excuse me the
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
um commissioner that
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
investigates the charge is not a part at
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
all of the hearing process so as you
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
would a jury of your peers you have
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
three people who come from different
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
walks of life some are in business uh
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
some may own businesses some are retired
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
some may be attorneys uh there's a
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
variety of people that are that make up
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
the seven and there's a variety of of uh
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
of that seven that um administ are our
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
hearings so there is an opportunity for
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
fairness as well as a jury of your peers
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think I lost the question in
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
cover um and I think if I remember
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
correctly it was three impartial
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
um officers that were appointed they're
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
not paid they were volunteer is that
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
correct so all correct all seven of our
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
commissioners are appointed um any
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
citizen any citizen can write a letter
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
to the governor of the state regardless
 
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
of who that Governor is that Governor
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
will then determine if that person is
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
someone who could sit um as a
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner on the commission and those
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
individuals are customarily appointed
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
for a five-year term unless they are
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
completing someone else's term and um
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
historically there have been pastors
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
there have been attorneys that are
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um there are business
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that are Commission
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
so people come from a variety of walks
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
of life okay and can you explain to me
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
just for clarification purposes are they
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
sitting like as a jury wood and just
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
hearing or is is one of them who's who's
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
the person who's actually directing the
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing so when the hearing panel is
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
selected um they will receive
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
information much like a judge would um
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
that the both parties are responsible
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
there are certain dates that they have
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
to have all of their Discovery to us
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
their evidence and and W list of
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
witnesses Etc um that information is uh
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
contained at the commission and then the
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
morning of the hearing as you would you
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't give your jury you know all of the
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
evidence a week before so the
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are given the information
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the morning what's relevant so they
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
will initially get the charge the
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
initial charge of discrimination as well
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
as um the um investigative report and
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's something that would be available
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
to the public and then as evidence is
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
agreed upon during the course of the
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
hearing then that evidence which we have
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
a copies of will then be given to the
 
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and they are listening to
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
both sides present their case they're
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
able to ask questions um are the rules a
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
little different than Court in terms of
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
hearsay and um and producing some
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
evidence yes they are primarily because
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of people who are bringing
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
a charge are unre presented meaning they
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't have an attorney so and some of
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
these charges you're you may not be able
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
to find an attor an attorney contingency
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
or not it doesn't matter it's a small
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's too small of a case for an attorney
 
01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
um and so once the uh evidence is agreed
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
upon and that evidence is is um
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
introduced in the hearing then there's
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
questions that are asked both sides can
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh refute the evidence and and put on
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
their best case and then once the
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
hearing is done then the Commissioners
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
will then uh convene and deliberate and
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
there are specific rules uh dealing with
 
01:22:31.629 --> 01:22:31.639 align:start position:0%
deliberation and what they should do and
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
then there is a clerk that's present to
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
assist them in understanding or making
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
sure that they are understanding what
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
the legal standard is and what they're
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
looking for and it's not well I just
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
think you know that Joey should get this
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
because you know Joey sounded really sad
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
when he gave testimony well what does
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
the law say and so they are to use the
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
law to make that determination whether
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause or not and so is
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
one of the three of there kind of
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
considered the chair correct yes okay
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then could you tell me just while
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
you're speaking it maybe consider this
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
question do you know roughly what
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of employers have are
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
represented verse you know what portion
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
are prosay and the same with regard to
 
01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:16.910 align:start position:0%
are prosay and the same with regard to
the

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
employees um so if I had to make a
 
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
really really really really really rough
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
guess off the top of my head um in terms
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
of respondents or businesses I would say
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
90% would be represented or maybe even
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
95% would be represented um and then
 
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
maybe there's 5% that are unrepresented
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of employers and it would be
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
the opposite for uh the the person who's
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
making the complaint 90 to 95% would be
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
unrepresented and maybe there's 5% that
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
are it would certainly depend on the
 
01:23:50.669 --> 01:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
case I mean sometimes um there's
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
something there's a disability case
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
where there could be some information
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
that makes it you know agreeable for an
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
attorney um but also the the other part
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
of that on both sides is the person may
 
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:05.719 align:start position:0%
not be represented in the beginning but
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
based on a finding then they may be able
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
to pick up rep representation um but I
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
still think those numbers are
 
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
significantly low for the complainant or
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
the the individual who's filing the
 
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
charge even if there's a probable cause
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
finding on their behalf um there's not a
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
lot that will always have an opportunity
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
to pick up an attorney not certainly
 
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
because they're not looking for one or
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
asking but there may not be an attorney
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to take the case
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason wonderful is there a
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
way that you would be able to check that
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
that data um I don't know if it's in
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
your files if there's a if they have to
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
submit an appearance of some sort like
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
you would in court if you'd be able to
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
to check that in your files like what
 
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
that percentage is or if that's data
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
that you don't
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
track um we would have to do quite a bit
 
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
of research we don't necessarily track
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
that um I mean obviously yes the the
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
attorney is mentioned and all of the
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
information is within the case um but I
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
can see what information we might be
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
able to pull and it would certainly
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
depend on how far back you would want us
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
to go so I'll I'll see what's possible
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
even like a Year's worth of like recent
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
data would be wonderful at the Andress
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the before we move on the question
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
is the percentage of either prosay or
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me complainants or represent
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
resp respond that are represented versus
 
01:25:26.159 --> 01:25:28.510 align:start position:0%
resp respond that are represented versus
unrepresented

01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
my question how
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
often do three Commissioners meet to
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
hold hearings and like how many cases
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
just an average would they hear every in
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
the day while they're
 
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
there thank you for the question so
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
before I answer that I just want to
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
point out we I think consistently we've
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
been as a group stuck on the number of
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
hearings that are being had and it's a
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
worthy question because um because of
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation however as the attorneys
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously there are multiple
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
ways that a case can be resolved a
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
hearing is one such way so uh we've had
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three hearings in the last
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
few years however there are four
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
hearings scheduled a month and within
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
the scheduling of those four hearings um
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
people people are settling um and there
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
are because respondents can remove now
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
after probable cause is found then we
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
certainly do a conciliation and a
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
conciliation is a fancy word to say a
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
mediation after probable cause has been
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
found so mediation is voluntary we have
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
a a slew of uh voluntary mediators that
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
will help us with that process and it is
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary for both parties however
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
conciliation is not so that is mandat M
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
atory so you must conciliate if you if
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
conciliation fails then we do move on
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
with the hearing however um respondents
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
Council will customarily make let us
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
know either prior to or maybe during the
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
conciliation that if it fails they're
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
definitely removing it to court so then
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
the unrepresented individual now has to
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
create uh has to either find an attorney
 
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
or learn very quickly how to navigate
 
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
welcome go ahead
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
Ros thank you I wanted to ask director
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
Maliki we heard that um employers
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
Witnesses are not always being
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
interviewed and I just wanted to get
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
your response to that sure thank you for
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
the question so the commission has the
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
authority to receive a charge to pass on
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
a charge and make determinations as to
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
who's interviewed the complaintant is
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
always was interviewed because this is
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
their case um when the respondent
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
provides information to the commission
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the production of documents
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
if there's an email that says I fired
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
this individual because they were
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
black that's kind of The Smoking Gun
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
there right so if it's necessary to
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
interview um a respondent we absolutely
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
will um the attorneys usually will pull
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
those documents together and uh there
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
are times where we don't and there are
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
times where we do uh and it's important
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh everyone certainly
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
feels like they're heard but I think
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
what's also being missed is there's the
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
potential for quite a few of the charges
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
to be found no probable cause so it
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the commission has
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
taken a position and that now the
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
respondent has to prove to us that
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
they're not guilty of discrimination we
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
don't have that position the position is
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
this in and an individual has brought a
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
charge of discrimination we're going to
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
do our due diligence and gather
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
information and and get paperwork
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
whatever is necessary um for the the
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
investigation of that charge now I think
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
something that was missed um in our
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
process uh the and and I think the
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
attorney actually ultimately got to this
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
point if they feel like it the case
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
should be dismissed they write a motion
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
to dismiss it's not brand new law they
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
already know how to do this and they use
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
that they also will make sure that if
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
there's an appeal or um if they don't
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
agree with something or if they want to
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
amend their charge or any of those
 
01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities to write motions and in
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
those motions go back and forth between
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
the parties whether the complainant has
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
an attorney or not they will then have
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
to answer the motion so motions can go
 
01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:49.639 align:start position:0%
back and forth for a year year and a
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
half or longer uh which is which which
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
is the right of the respondent to have
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
motions entered um on their on their
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
behalf absolutely and the case does not
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
determined thank you for that answer I
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
think you're going to teach me some
 
01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
second thing that I didn't quite
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
understand I like to learn new things
 
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
from what you said um in determining
 
01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.030 align:start position:0%
from what you said um in determining
probable

01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
probable
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
cause um which can go on for a long
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
time um you are determining that without
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
feeling the need to check with um the
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
respondent that that you see no need to
 
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
find out from the respondent whether
 
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
this information is accurate whether
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
there were compelling circumstances
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
whatever else lawyers would
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
would use
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
um you feel in order to determine
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
probable cause you only need to ask
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions of the um complaintant that
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's not accurate actually so um I'm
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought that's what you just
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
said which is I guess I that I'm glad
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to clarify that for me
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so when a charge is filed the
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
charge goes to the respondent and they
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to answer and they
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
will answer in writing so they will put
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
into writing their um agreement to
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
certain elements that Johnny was hired
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
here as an employee assistant Johnny
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
worked here for five years Johnny was
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
promoted those are things that they
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
would certainly customarily agree to and
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
if there are if there's contention
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
within the charge of discrimination that
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
is responded to by the respondent so
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a there's information in writing
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
if there's not if there's more
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
information information that is
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
necessary in terms of the investigator
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
discovering additional information well
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
the complainant is saying that they
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
weren't promoted because of their race
 
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
gender national origin that information
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
is requ additional information is
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
requested of the respondent so it is not
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
every single time it is not that there's
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
automatically a determination made that
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
the respondent is in error or the
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
respondent was discriminatory and so we
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
just don't want to talk to them
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
there is a great deal of information
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
that goes back and forth and I would say
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
more likely than not um respondents are
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
interviewed and if the if the attorney
 
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't want the respondant to be
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
interviewed they have that choice uh but
 
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
requests are made to interview um both
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
parties and if they don't want to or
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
don't want it recorded or any of those
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
things they have the right to not
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
participate if I could just follow up
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand then why PE
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh respondents or representatives of
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
respondents who have met with
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
us in this on this bill on the previous
 
01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
bills that have been before us have been
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent in saying amongst the
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
problems that they uh would like us to
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
think about is the fact that in
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
determining um probable cause
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
the respondents are not
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily given an opportunity to
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
respond so the respondents will always
 
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
respond there is a written portion that
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
is always always a part of the
 
01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.109 align:start position:0%
is always always a part of the
investigation

01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
always um the respondents council may
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
have a Litany of witnesses that maybe
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's six Witnesses for example and
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
all six of them are going to to say the
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
exact same thing the commission can
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
determine we need one and the and the
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
attorney will give some uh indication as
 
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
to what those Witnesses are going to
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
testify to so do we need to intervi
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
interview six people that will say the
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
exact same thing probably not um if the
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
the respondent themselves would be
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
interviewed certainly um and it depends
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
on each case again if there's a I didn't
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
hire this person because of whatever and
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
that's in writing then there's certainly
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
follow up questions that would be um um
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
addressed to the respondent so that they
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
can answer that to say well this isn't
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is an email that the complainant
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
has or if in our uh uh request for
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
information if they've turned over
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
documents that says Jim didn't hire
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
Sally because she was a woman it's kind
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
of clear there um the attorney certainly
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
is going to look over that information
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
and they would certainly give a
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory reason why whatever
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
the allegation of discrimination is
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
didn't happen that way so people assume
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
or the person bringing the charge can
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
say well I wasn't uh promoted because I
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
was 40 years old but that's not the case
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
based on the information that the
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
respondent shared the respondent shows
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
that the person didn't get the promotion
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
not because they were 40 years old but
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they've been on multiple
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
performance Improvement plans and the
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
person was not improving so they needed
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
to have other action taking place or
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
maybe termination so those things are
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
discovered as we do the investigations I
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
think some of the issue comes in when an
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
attorney may have a Litany of people
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
that they desire for us to interview but
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
the majority of those people are saying
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
the same thing over and over so maybe we
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
choose one instead of all six and that
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
would be for them problematic because
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
they feel their Cas is super strong and
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
they we should talk to all six
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that uh
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
clarification um one of the efforts that
 
01:35:59.709 --> 01:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
I think we're all making in the
 
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislature in the other branches of
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
government um is what goes under the
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
general term of transparency because we
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
find that even if people don't agree
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
with what's happening if they see that
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
the process has been filed or what the
 
01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:21.159 align:start position:0%
decision is and they're informed it um
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
they can be they can be willing to
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
accept something that they otherwise
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
might not be happy with and
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
um I might have missed something I
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
certainly am willing to be educated on
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
this but in looking at your own website
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
in state government looks to me as if it
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated since
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
2018 am I am I wrong about that are you
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
speaking specifically about
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
about about the data on the commission
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
website those
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
statistics well that's that's yes data
 
01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
the data on on has not been updated um
 
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
since 2018 and that clearly
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
um uh makes it difficult for people who
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
want to feel
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable with all your hard work um
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
to be able to to verify that and am I am
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
I missing something and I am I I'm
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
asking it as a question I don't I don't
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
ask loaded questions um no you're not
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
missing anything so um what you're
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
asking about is um the way so in the
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
training that you all participated in um
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
there are statistics so uh you would
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
have the number of cases filed number of
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
cases open number of cases closed uh the
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
the areas of discri discrimination or
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
the basis that a certain number of cases
 
01:37:57.629 --> 01:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
were were would have been filed in
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me and when we looked at how
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
were calculated I'll say in the past
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
there was no real Rhyme or Reason as to
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
how those numbers were calculated and so
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
um trying to be careful here so to not
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
and why you trying to be careful well I
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
I don't want to throw anybody under the
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
bus you know we're not we're not in on
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
trial here we're trying to just get the
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
facts ma'am well the more we know the
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
more we can help you you want to do a
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
job and we want you to do the job so
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
previous administrations we'll call it
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
calculated calculated um statistical
 
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
information a variety of ways and when
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
you look at those numbers it is very
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
unclear as to how those calc
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
calculations uh came to be and it just
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense isn't that
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't that give you more of a reason
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
to do it the right way the way that you
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
think makes sense so that you can get
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
rid of um statistics that have uh data
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
whatever word what's you know algorithms
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
is the word I'm also have to become
 
01:39:15.589 --> 01:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with I know that um I mean
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
isn't there uh a even more reason for
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
you to say this is the right way to do
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
it and I'm in charge and I'm going to
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's done the right way
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get rid of the ancient
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
numbers and put in current numbers and
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
develop a system to make sure they're
 
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
always kept current so that doesn't
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
matter if somebody else did it a
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
different way you're in
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
charge agreed um we've had meetings with
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
um NHS to uh learn how they calculate
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
their numbers because the part of the
 
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
conundrum is commission numbers are not
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
one to one so one charge file does not
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
mean one basis someone could file a
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
charge based on age which is one area
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
national origin which is another area
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
and gender so you could have three bases
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
in one charge and so how do you
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
calculate those numbers so that they're
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
actually accurate what what methodology
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
are you using and um in meeting with
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
nhes there was some really great
 
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
information however it would require a a
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
a Computing system um not quite a data
 
01:40:33.149 --> 01:40:33.159 align:start position:0%
not quite a database but another way of
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
providing that information and so that
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
is something that we've been looking at
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
and working on okay how do we get this
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
information so that it makes sense to
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
people I mean even in uh the monthly
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
reports that we do or conversations that
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
we have with the legislature
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
it it's challenging because in your
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
brain you would think it's a onetoone
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
correlation one charge open one charge
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
closed but it's one case open multiple
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
bases is how it's closed so that has
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
been the difficulty well I have
 
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
confidence that you can solve that and
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
I'm looking forward to seeing what
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
happens but thank you for that um so I
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up with a couple
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
questions so when we went to the HRC we
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
were told that 's a current spreadsheet
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
that tracks all of the cases is that
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
correct correct yes and who is the
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet uh I'm sorry um pending or
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
open so are there two different
 
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets I'm sorry so there's a
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
pending file that all of the information
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
is on a the for the pending cases that
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
information is on that particular
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and then as cases are
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
assigned they are also tracked so I
 
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not clear on the question so
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
that I can give you an answer okay so is
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
there a separate spreadsheet that has
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
assigned cases um yes once they move off
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
of pending because you don't want
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
something to be to to be shown that it's
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
not assigned to an investigator then
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's moved over to a different
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so that you can reflect that
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
this has been assigned and what which
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
investigator the case has been assigned
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
to okay and who keeps track of that
 
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet with the assigned cases so
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
customarily the assistant director would
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
um as well as our senior investigator uh
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
does have some flexibility to do that as
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh she is part of the how we track what
 
01:42:39.629 --> 01:42:39.639 align:start position:0%
we're doing in terms of opening cases
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
and closing cases and keeping our
 
01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.070 align:start position:0%
and closing cases and keeping our
monthly

01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
metrics okay so they would be able to go
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
in then and and go into the spreadsheet
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly then and find out for us
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
what is the oldest assigned case then
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay so there's no cases that have
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
been lost they're they're being tracked
 
01:43:00.669 --> 01:43:00.679 align:start position:0%
either on one of these two spreadsheets
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not that we're that we've lost
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
track of some sort of a case correct
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody else have any
 
01:43:09.719 --> 01:43:11.950 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody else have any
questions

01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
Manos director Maliki I just wanted to
 
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
ask for clarification I believe
 
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the point of not always
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
interviewing employer
 
01:43:24.189 --> 01:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
Witnesses you said that sometimes as I
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
understood it you said sometimes it's
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
clear that there is a probable cause and
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
therefore you wouldn't interview
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily interview an employer's
 
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
Witnesses is that
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
correct not so much that there was a
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause because that's a
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
different determination but be that that
 
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
that a particular action took place
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
during the course of during the course
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the investigation there's an
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
allegation that's made and so if there's
 
01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony um from both parties
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
because it would have to be corroborated
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
by the by the respondent that they did
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it was um that maybe seven
 
01:44:06.189 --> 01:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
Witnesses are not interviewed um I I'm
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
not sure I'd have to double check on a
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
time when a respondent themselves would
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
not be interviewed um there is certainly
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities for um a variety of vol
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
volumes of written information they have
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
to respond to the charge um if there's a
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
a request for more information then that
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
is requested um certainly either before
 
01:44:29.119 --> 01:44:30.030 align:start position:0%
is requested um certainly either before
the

01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
investigation goes in full because the
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
investigator is looking at the case File
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
or if there are um other elements that
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
have come forth once the complainant has
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
been interviewed then the respondent
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
always has an opportunity to rebut so
 
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
that happens on both sides so if the
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
respondent says we didn't do this then
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
and all of the information is exchanged
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
between both of the parties then the
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
complaintant can say well no you did do
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
this and then there's an opportunity for
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
rebuttal so it's not as though
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
respondents are not unheard
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
from I was asking specifically about
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
interviewing employer Witnesses and I I
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
I heard you say earlier that there were
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
two kind of clear-cut instances in which
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
you might not interview an employer's
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
Witnesses one was if there's a Smoking
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
Gun and use you use the example of an
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
email where an emplo an employer an
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
employee of the employer says I fired
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
Sally because she was black or whatever
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
um and then the other example I thought
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
you gave was if it's pretty clear that
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
there is no probable cause you wouldn't
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily interview the employer's
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
Witnesses so I'm just asking about
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
interviewing Witnesses of the employer
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm not sure that I'm
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
understanding but uh I think what I'm
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
hearing you say um and I think it's the
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
last part that I need to respond to the
 
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
employer may present a list of six
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
witnesses that um they feel are
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
important to uh to the investigation and
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
usually to some degree especially if
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's an attorney they will stipulate to
 
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
some degree what those Witnesses are
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
going to testify to if all six Witnesses
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
are saying
 
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
um you know Michelin well we shouldn't
 
01:46:29.589 --> 01:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
say that but big box uh big big box
 
01:46:32.669 --> 01:46:32.679 align:start position:0%
office is a great place to work and I've
 
01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
never seen anything and that's what all
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
six are going to say we don't need to
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
talk to six Witnesses um if one of them
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we speak to one of them um
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
certainly we would want to interview the
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
HR person or the supervisor or the
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
company owner it would depend on how the
 
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
company was situated and what the actual
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
charge was as to who we would want to
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
talk to um if at some point those
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
individuals cannot be located by the
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
attorney um then we're unable to
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
interview them thank you thank you when
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
we went back uh on June 28th you
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
currently had five five investigators
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
and had received budget to hire four
 
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
more I just wanted to follow have those
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
four additional investigators been hired
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that uh no they haven't
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh we are in the middle of moving so
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be moving at the end of October um
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
and to not disrupt their education and
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
flow it makes more sense to wait until
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
we move because I the the process would
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
be to hire all of them at the same time
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
so that all of them can be trained at
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
the same time and nothing is missed and
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
then they're all starting together so
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
have the positions been posted now if I
 
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
mean October is only a month away at
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
this point so have the positions been
 
01:47:58.189 --> 01:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
posted they have not okay thank
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
you go ahead rep again before I ask my
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
actual question I'll just comment we
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about your reports and the
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
data files that's endemic to state
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
government I'm dealing with another
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
major cabinet agency where I just had
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
very simple basic data that was in a PDF
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
file I just
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
wanted the spreadsheets they had to the
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
data files and I was shocked that they
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
don't seem to have them but um so you're
 
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
doing better than many other agencies in
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
that regard even though it's not perfect
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
but my question was about uh to's get
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
back to the process um this whole thing
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
begins because an employee feels that he
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
or she is uh being treated unfairly by
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
their employer and um so I guess and I
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's probably pretty obvious question
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
but like since you talked about how you
 
01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
know one of the things you look for is
 
01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
like the process have gone through so it
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
so it's in probably in the vast majority
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
of the cases the employer is well aware
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
that this employee was unhappy and that
 
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
there's a situation it's just a question
 
01:49:02.189 --> 01:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
of the uh process not whatever their
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
response to it internally not working so
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
you only get involved only after like
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
something has already gone pretty far
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
sideways anyway
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
so is that is that probably an accurate
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
question if I if you can even understand
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
what I said um I I think I understood
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
what you said um but actually it's not
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's not always so so there are times
 
01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
where an employee may not be pleased
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
about something and the employer doesn't
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
know that has happened um there are
 
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
times where the employee had an issue
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
and they notified the employer based on
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
what the policies and procedures are
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
with the employer and the employer
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
actually did all of the things correct
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
that they were supposed to do they
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
disciplined they talk to people they did
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
all of the things correct
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the employee still files a charge of
 
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination it could be because they
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like the punishment or the
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
outcome was what they wanted or they
 
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
didn't feel it was severe enough or they
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
just didn't feel Justified or hurt or
 
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
any of those things and that that is not
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
to diminish people who have gone through
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
a process or attempted to go through a
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
process and the employers did not follow
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
through um but it it's fair to say that
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
there are times where the employer
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that the employee is
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
unhappy or that the employer did
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
everything that they were supposed to do
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
and the employee is still unhappy and
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
will file a charge of discrimination why
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
would that happen because that
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
individual has the right the legal right
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
to file a charge but what happens during
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
the investigation is we are requesting
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
information and the employer produces
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
information that shows well no you know
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
soand so came in and they talked to
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
their supervisor it was escalated to HR
 
01:50:55.390 --> 01:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
it was handled appropriately and
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the punishments or Consequences
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
were were all done in accordance to the
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures then that would
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
be something that those documents would
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
be turned over and during the course of
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
the investigation we look at all of that
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
and go there is no probable cause here
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to move it move it
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
forward because the business did what we
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
call Prompt remedial action they did
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
everything according to the law as well
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
as their policies and proced procedures
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
that they were supposed to
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
do follow up go ahead um when you're
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
investigating the complaintants um how
 
01:51:31.069 --> 01:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
much latitude you have to talk to other
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
employees since one employee um
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
obviously doesn't necessarily know what
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
their colleagues experien is and in many
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
cases uh you know their employees are
 
01:51:44.069 --> 01:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
discouraged from discussing their
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
employment conditions with each other
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
certainly the most important thing is
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
how much you paid it's very common for
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
for companies to have Unwritten or even
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
written rules so you're not supposed to
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
ask the the other employees how much
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
they made so that's uh obviously makes
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
it easier to get away with uh pay
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination if the employees don't
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
know what other people are being paid so
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
like so you do the investigation are you
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
able to like talk to other people who
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
are at the same other colleagues of the
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh of the employee to see if they're
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
having similar experiences or um thank
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes we are um so
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
the complainant would then submit some
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
witnesses that they would like for us to
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
speak with just like the respondent has
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to opportunity to submit
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um there are times where it's
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
a situation where maybe it was something
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
verbal or there was some other type of
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
altercation and those in there were some
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that were present when this
 
01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
situation happened so those would be
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses to a particular event um they
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
may have conversations with people for
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
your example of of pay differences they
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
may have conversations with folks and
 
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
find out oh well we're doing the exact
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
same job and I'm making $4 less so they
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
might provide those Witnesses but if
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
their allegation is dealing with unfair
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
pay um in in violation of the Equal Pay
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
Act then what we can do in our in our
 
01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
investigation is to request pay records
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
for people who are similar similarly
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
situated to gather that information if
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
necessary thanks
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank thank you if there's no forther
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
questions I'll call up the
 
01:53:25.149 --> 01:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
next I think we have to I'm not sure do
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%

absolutely

01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%

Hatfield here in conquer right around
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
the corner I've been practicing
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
employment law for 32 years representing
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
uh primarily employees in disputes uh I
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
have been practicing before the new New
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Human Rights Commission and
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
the state and federal courts of our
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
state uh since I started practicing um
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
and I feel like I have a a very good
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
sense of things um I appreciate everyone
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
being here uh today and I also heard a a
 
01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
fair amount today from uh my colleagues
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the aisle um I have
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
great respect for all of those uh other
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys who testified here but I
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
certainly have a different view from
 
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
them on a number of things related to
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
how cases uh proceed before uh before
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
the commission um and I just wanted to
 
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
sort of point out a couple of things
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
where I had some disagreements um about
 
01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony that you heard
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
today um I do not believe that there's
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
any requirement in the statute that an
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
employer attend that conciliation
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
hearing before removing a case to court
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
I I had Marissa bring up the statute so
 
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
I could confirm um but if you look at
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
RSA 354a 20 1A as soon as there's been a
 
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding the employer can
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
remove to court and I certainly agree
 
01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
that after a probable cause finding the
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission sets up a
 
01:55:35.149 --> 01:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
conciliation process which as one of
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
these attorneys described is similar to
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
a mediation it's sort of a combination
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
between a mediation which is sort of a
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
settlement conference and also sort of a
 
01:55:47.709 --> 01:55:47.719 align:start position:0%
preparation for the hearing before the
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
commission that's going forward but I
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
certainly have had cases and this has
 
01:55:54.589 --> 01:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
happened a lot which is why I think I
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
can give you a fairly unique perspective
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
I have had potential uh employees who've
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
had a case at the commission contact me
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
and said a probable cause finding was
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
issued in my case by the Human Rights
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
Commission we were scheduled to go to a
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
conciliation but now the employer has
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
removed me to the state Superior Court
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that abs
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely does and can happen lawfully
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
under the statute so that there's never
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
a conciliation there's never an effort
 
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
to have a resolution of of the case
 
01:56:32.109 --> 01:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um and and I would like to
 
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
follow up on on something that uh
 
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative cab said several hours
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
ago um which really brings us to to the
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
reason that this bill is before you for
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
for consideration and that is that these
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
cases so much of the time employees are
 
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
not represented by attorneys no doubt
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
attorneys who represent complainants
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
often time take the cases on a
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
contingent fee basis but there can be no
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
doubt that there has to be an economic
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
analysis before an employment attorney
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
can take a case on a contingent fee
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
basis as you've heard these cases go on
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
for a very very long time many many
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
years and so there are a large volume of
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
complainants I think uh executive
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
director Malachi just said she thinks
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
95% of the cases before the commission
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
are with respect to complainants who are
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
unrepresented by Council it is those
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
people that this bill is so so critical
 
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
for because otherwise what happens is
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
they sit in the commission oftentimes
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
two years sometimes coming up on three
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
years there's finally a probable cause
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
finding issued in their case they want
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing before the commission
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
because a hearing before the commission
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
is much more easily navigated by a an
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
unrepresented party someone who is not
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
represented an employee who does not
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
have an attorney who gets their probable
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
cause finding and then has the employer
 
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
remove the case to
 
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
court essentially unless they can find
 
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
an attorney to represent them I can tell
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
you their case is over there is no way
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
an unrepresented employee a prosay
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
employee can deal with the resources and
 
01:58:27.629 --> 01:58:27.639 align:start position:0%
the process of litigation in the state
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
or federal courts of this of our state
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
without an attorney representing them it
 
01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
is for those employees and as
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative katab mentioned it is
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
employees really at oftentimes the lower
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
end of the wage Spectrum who most need
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
this relief who most need to have their
 
01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.069 align:start position:0%
this relief who most need to have their
dead

01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
dead
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
to try to seek Justice in these cases
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
and they are able to see to get Justice
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
at the Human Rights Commission um I I I
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
did want to mention I I did disagree um
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
with one thing that attorney uh
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
Chatfield um mentioned and so I just
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh to bring it up to you but I
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
I think she was saying that from her
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
perspective um that it's difficult to
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
get a fair hearing and that uh the
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
commission are already looking at you as
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
being guilty um but before you get to
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
the hearing if you're on the employer
 
01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
side I don't think that's true at all as
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
executive director Malachi just
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
described the the process is that when
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
the case finally gets assigned to an
 
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
investigator the investigator does an
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
investigation at the end of the
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
investigation that my understanding is
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
they submit a report to I think they're
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
called the investigating commissioner
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
if that commissioner signs off and
 
01:59:54.069 --> 01:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
agrees that there should be a probable
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
cause finding in the by the commission a
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
completely different set of
 
02:00:01.709 --> 02:00:01.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is assigned to sit on the
 
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
hearing so the person who was the
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
investigating commissioner who signed
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
the probable cause finding can never and
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
would never be the person who is sitting
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
on the hearing before the commission so
 
02:00:16.069 --> 02:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
I I really very much disagree with that
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
and and I think that if I I wish I had
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
some of these uh statistics with me but
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm not used to having necessarily all
 
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
of this at my fingertips but I think
 
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
that if you looked at the results from
 
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
hearings before the Human Rights
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
Commission a huge percentage of
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
decisions from the Human Rights
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
Commission actually go against the
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
employee not in favor of the employee so
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
I I just don't think that it is fair to
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
say that an employer cannot get a fair
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
Shake uh having a hearing at the Human
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission I think that for a a
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
an unrepresented party particularly an
 
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
AG grieved employee who is a low wage
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
earner who was not able to get an
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
attorney to take their case if they if
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
they wait all that time and they get
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
that probable cause finding and then the
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
employer can remove them to court
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's only one reason the employer is
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
removing them to court because the
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
employer knows that there will not be a
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field once they get to
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
court there simply won't be there's just
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
no way I think all of us know that in
 
02:01:22.069 --> 02:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
the legal system if you have the
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
plaintiff being unrepresented and the
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
defendant being represented that's not a
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field so I'm happy to
 
02:01:31.229 --> 02:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
again I'm extremely familiar with the
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
process I've been handling cases for a
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
long time and and really done work at
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission for my
 
02:01:39.199 --> 02:01:40.910 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission for my
entire

02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
career thank you for coming in and
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
giving us all this information I do
 
02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it I guess my question
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
to you would be do you think that
 
02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
there's a a way that we could make this
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
be fair kind of on both sides I had
 
02:01:57.550 --> 02:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
previously suggested perhaps that
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
removal on the employer side not be
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
allowed until after you know
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
conciliation was at least in good faith
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
attempted um do you think that there's
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
some similar way or do you have a
 
02:02:11.470 --> 02:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
can make it feel Fair on both sides MH I
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
I personally don't think that that would
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
make much of a difference I think that
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy to sort of go to a
 
02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
conciliation that's conducted by a
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative of the Human Rights
 
02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:27.910 align:start position:0%
representative of the Human Rights
Commission

02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not saying people aren't
 
02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
coming in good faith I'm certain they're
 
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
coming in good faith but they can easily
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
come with extremely extremely limited
 
02:02:39.629 --> 02:02:39.639 align:start position:0%
Authority that would lead the plaintiff
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
to still feel like they're not receiving
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
receiving Justice for the settlement
 
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's being offered and so I I wouldn't
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that I mean I I I personally
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
really feel that it makes sense that
 
02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:55.719 align:start position:0%
this bill that would allow uh only the
 
02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
plaintiff to remove to court but that
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
but not to allow the employer to remove
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
to court I think is a very very fair
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
system I I really think it is a fair
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
system because I think that the hearings
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
process at the Human Rights Commission
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
is a fair system before the three
 
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who haven't had anything
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
to do with the investigation of the case
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
from the time the charge was filed up
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
through the date they're assigned to
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
hear uh the case as the three
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
SM thank you so much for sitting here
 
02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
all morning and listening to this and we
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
were're very pleased to hear from you
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble understanding
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
why giving one side whichever the side
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
right and not giving that right to the
 
02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:50.350 align:start position:0%
right and not giving that right to the
other

02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.270 align:start position:0%
other
side

02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
is creating a fair system I think that's
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
because the playing field has never been
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
level between employers and employees it
 
02:04:06.109 --> 02:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
it just hasn't the the employers have
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
all the resources you know I know there
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
was was talk about uh individual
 
02:04:13.149 --> 02:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
defendants being named in charges
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes I can never think of a case I
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
had where that where that individual
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
name defendant in a case was not
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
represented by Council on the whole in
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
my experience the uh the employer either
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
uses the same attorney for the
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
individual as for the employer itself or
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
if they think there might be a potential
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
conflict they assign a different
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
attorney to represent that it is a very
 
02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
very rare event where there'd be an
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
individual respondent who would be
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
unrepresented and so I think that the
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
playing field just isn't level as as a
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
result because of that because employers
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
have more money and when an employee has
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
lost his or her job that's the lowest
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
point in their life oftentimes and they
 
02:05:02.830 --> 02:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the economic resources
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
they're wondering how they can feed
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
their family how they can pay their rent
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
how they can really keep a roof over
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
their head and they certainly can't pay
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
an attorney by the hour uh to to
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
represent them uh thank you and I hear
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
that and I also hear you say that you
 
02:05:24.189 --> 02:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
believe that all the systems at the
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
human uh relations commission are are
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
fine how could it be fine if using what
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
I would say is normal understanding of
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
what a pending case is um not the
 
02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
special language that was explained to
 
02:05:46.549 --> 02:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
to me a little earlier how can you say
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
having a year or more p ask before the
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
process even gets to the Starting
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
Gate how that is fair for the person who
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't know where their rent money is
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
coming from who doesn't know um where
 
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
their food money is coming from how
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
could that be a fair system okay and
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
again I just um I I I'm sorry but I
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
think you might have misunderstood one
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
of the comments I made earlier I'm not
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
saying that the way the entire system is
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
working at the Human Rights Commission
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
is fine I'm I'm not saying that at all I
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
haven't even addressed that and I I I'd
 
02:06:28.109 --> 02:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer questions for you
 
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
about it but I can tell you that I I
 
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely Echo some of the concerns you
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
heard from the employer attorneys um
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
earlier about the fact that the system
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
at the Human Rights Commission is not
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
working fine certainly not from the time
 
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
that a charge is filed through the time
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a probable cause or a no
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause in the case it is taking
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
literally years for these cases to get
 
02:06:58.750 --> 02:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
through the system so I'm not saying
 
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
that the that the system is fine but I
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that you're ruling on this
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
bill or making a decision about whether
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill will advance doesn't have to
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
do anything with sort of the rest of the
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
system and how the system is is not fine
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
I don't really know exactly what the
 
02:07:20.189 --> 02:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
cause is for the delay but I have no
 
02:07:22.350 --> 02:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
doubt that it is under funding by the
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
commission the fact that they have very
 
02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:26.679 align:start position:0%
few Commissioners I think at one point
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
they had five but I know that I I
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
believe this summer they lost another
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
investigator so I think there's only
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
four investigators at the commission a
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
and right now these cases go into a
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
black hole and honestly that's a problem
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
systemwide because employers know that
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
when cases get to the Human Rights
 
02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
Commission they know it's a black hole
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so I disagree that there are
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
Monumental efforts ever made by an
 
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
employer to resolve a case that is
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
pending in the the Human Rights
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
Commission in our my experience
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
employers are happy enough to see the
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
cases sit there and languish for years
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
and years and years and in my own office
 
02:08:10.589 --> 02:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
and among colleagues I know I'm in an
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire called the
 
02:08:14.589 --> 02:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
National Employment Lawyers
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
Association I know many many of my
 
02:08:20.189 --> 02:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues have cases that are sitting
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the commission almost up to the
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
three-year Mark and and the reason the
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
three-year Mark is important is that if
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
you want to bring a case in court under
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
our state statute you only have a
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
three-year period to do it there are
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
cases including a case we had recently
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
at our office where the Human Rights
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
Commission had not completed its
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
investigation and we were on the cusp of
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
3 years and had to to make a decision
 
02:08:48.119 --> 02:08:48.950 align:start position:0%
3 years and had to to make a decision
about

02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:50.599 align:start position:0%
trying to get the case out of the
 
02:08:53.229 --> 02:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
commission and file in court so the
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
system the system is absolutely broken
 
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that but we're
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
talking about what happens to cases that
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
finally make their way through the
 
02:09:05.310 --> 02:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
commission and get to the point where
 
02:09:07.229 --> 02:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
there has been a probable cause finding
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
issued it's what happens then because
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
again there at least has has been some
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
determination that there is some level
 
02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
of Merit that warrants a public hearing
 
02:09:22.669 --> 02:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
on the case at that point and for a an
 
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
employee an AG grieved employee to have
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
waited all that time and then to get a
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding and then have the
 
02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
case removed to court essentially it's
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
starting all over in the court system
 
02:09:36.669 --> 02:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
state or federal that employee is
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
looking at two more years even if they
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
could possibly weather the storm of
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
being unrepresented it is another two
 
02:09:46.109 --> 02:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
years in court it means that plaintiffs
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
who lose their job in 2020 may not see
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
Justice until
 
02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:53.390 align:start position:0%
Justice until
2025

02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
2025
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
um what do you think would happen and
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
02:10:00.549 --> 02:10:00.559 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this is going to happen
 
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm just trying to get people to focus
 
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
on what the real problems are what if um
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
this committee were to recommend to the
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
legislature that we remove from the
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
human relations commission the
 
02:10:15.199 --> 02:10:16.709 align:start position:0%
human relations commission the
employment

02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:20.559 align:start position:0%
um related uh discrimination and have
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
that go right to the court would that
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
would that be any better for either side
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
would that solve the problem I
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
personally don't think so but based on
 
02:10:34.510 --> 02:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing nobody's
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
willing to say anything other than the
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
money nobody said anything about the
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
qualification of the Commissioners no
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
one has said anything about the
 
02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:47.559 align:start position:0%
qualification of the other staff no one
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
has said anything anything about the
 
02:10:51.629 --> 02:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
training no one has said anything about
 
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
accountability about
 
02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:55.229 align:start position:0%
accountability about
reporting

02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to solve the problem
 
02:11:02.189 --> 02:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
because there are people out there who
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
feel that they were discriminated
 
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
against and they are not always but
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
usually people who don't have access to
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
the greatest resources now we could say
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that the state is required to Prov
 
02:11:19.229 --> 02:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
provide an
 
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
attorney for anyone who um brings um
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh a discrimination case but since the
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
the commission's uh
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
definition of pending
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
cases is only those that haven't even
 
02:11:41.069 --> 02:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
gotten to the Starting Gate when would
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
you appoint an
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
attorney um the problems are enormous
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
and I hope you wouldn't limit your your
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
thoughts to the specific language of the
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
bill because we have the opportunity to
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
solve a problem that I think everybody
 
02:12:01.629 --> 02:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
believes is out there but no one seems
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
willing to step up to the plate and say
 
02:12:07.390 --> 02:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
exactly what the problems are because
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
they don't want they don't want anybody
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
to not like them anymore well I'm
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
willing to step up to the plate so I
 
02:12:17.549 --> 02:12:17.559 align:start position:0%
disagree with that I'm happy to step up
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
to the plate
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
um I did want to mention one thing when
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
you you asked about sort of
 
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
qualifications of Commissioners or
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
training of Commissioners and I was
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that one of you might ask uh
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
executive director Malachi that because
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
it would be a great surprise to me if
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
there was not training given to
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners before they were asked to
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
hold hearings um in their role as
 
02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner I would be extremely
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
surprised if there was no training
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
process but I I don't know the answer to
 
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
the question but I'm sure invest I'm
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
sure executive director Malachi does um
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
I didn't ask that just because we did
 
02:12:53.709 --> 02:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
hear that during the tour so that
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
information had already been given to us
 
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
that there is training okay well I'm
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
happy to hear it and that's exactly what
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
I I would have expected um and I um at
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
one point during Co the hearings were
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
being held uh by Zoom they might still
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
be but I know that they were and I
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
observed a hearing um of a different
 
02:13:16.589 --> 02:13:16.599 align:start position:0%
attorney an attorney in Manchester who's
 
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
very well respected
 
02:13:20.669 --> 02:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
and the hearing to me H certainly looked
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
like it was conducted extremely
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
professionally there was a chair uh who
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
was running the the hearing each
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner was able to ask questions
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
um it certainly it it it in no way shape
 
02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
or form looked like a kangaroo court so
 
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
I I I just would hate for you to be left
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
with the impression that that it's not
 
02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
even a fair system once you get to that
 
02:13:43.229 --> 02:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
hearing before that panel of three
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I don't think I said
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
anything that would indicate that I
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
thought there was a the kangaroo Court
 
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
um I would be interested for example in
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
knowing um the time that lapsed from the
 
02:14:01.709 --> 02:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
moment that the um agreed party uh went
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
to the human relations commission until
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
a hearing was held for example um I
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of things that I
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
think are Central to this issue and um
 
02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.189 align:start position:0%
think are Central to this issue and um
it's

02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
everybody needs more money I do don't
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
you I mean you know I only get $183 you
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
think we get $200 but they take out the
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
Social Security um so I just want you to
 
02:14:34.109 --> 02:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
know that but um of course I have The
 
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
Misfortune of having my salary in the
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
United States in the New Hampshire state
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
constitution and there's never going to
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
be a majority forget about a super
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
majority to vote to change that um but
 
02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:48.750 align:start position:0%
majority to vote to change that um but
uh

02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:50.830 --> 02:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
this is I mean I I say that in it's SL
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to break the the tension
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
these are difficult questions and I
 
02:14:59.149 --> 02:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
don't see that we can say that there is
 
02:14:59.159 --> 02:15:00.589 align:start position:0%
don't see that we can say that there is
Justice

02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
02:15:00.599 --> 02:15:02.830 align:start position:0%
Justice
provided

02:15:02.830 --> 02:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
when the process goes on so long and the
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
research and investigation that finally
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
happens um on the part of the
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
investigators um then goes to um the
 
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
commission and starts all over
 
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
again um I wanted to if I could just uh
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
answer you with respect to the question
 
02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
about how long is it really elapsed
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
between the time a charge is filed and
 
02:15:37.709 --> 02:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
when a hearing is held and I am
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
virtually certain that the Human Rights
 
02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
Commission would have the data on that
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
for you with respect to cases over the
 
02:15:46.109 --> 02:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
past 5 years I am certain that you could
 
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
find out the the date because every time
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
a charge is filed at the Human Rights
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
Commission it gets docketed in our
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
office we often times will hand deliver
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
our charges so that we know for sure
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
what the docketing date is in it because
 
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want there to be any delay
 
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
between it arriving at the commission
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
and being docketed so we often hand
 
02:16:07.629 --> 02:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
deliver it they stamp a date right on
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
the charge that says what date it was
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
docketed at the Human Rights Commission
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate what what you say however
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
um um the commissioner has uh told us
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
that she doesn't have that information
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
available readily and so um it it just
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at Square pegs and
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
round holes we want to make a phone call
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
to get that for us because you did say
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
the assistant director or the senior
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
investigator uh would have access to
 
02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
that would you be able to to call them
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
and ask if they'd be able to look on the
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or they not in the office
 
02:16:43.359 --> 02:16:44.950 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or they not in the office
they

02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
are asking um what is the oldest case um
 
02:16:53.669 --> 02:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
currently hasn't reached a resolution
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
yet I guess is the B is the best word to
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
say it so it it might be a signed to
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
somebody but it's it just hasn't reached
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
a resolution
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
yet I will provide to you anecdotally I
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
did um send an email request out to
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
members of the National Employment
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
Lawyers Association the New Hampshire
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
chapter yesterday to try to find out
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
what some of the oldest pending cases
 
02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.599 align:start position:0%
were that people have at the Human
 
02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission um I uh have uh one
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
answer was that there was one uh still
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
at the commission that was filed in
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
September of
 
02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
2021 I have one uh that said that they
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
had filed a charge in on March 12th 2021
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
and there's still been no probable cause
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
determination on that one I had another
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
attorney say that there was one that was
 
02:17:46.349 --> 02:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
filed in May of
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
2021 um and the investigation was just
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
finished and a conciliation is scheduled
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
in October that but that means it still
 
02:17:57.549 --> 02:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone to even a public hearing yet
 
02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh there was another um uh and this was
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually a case where the attorney who
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
got back to me was representing a
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
respondent the charge was filed in
 
02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
2019 and the probable uh charge finding
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
was just issued this
 
02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
summer so I I can tell you there is
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
there are some very very old cases and
 
02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
this is just you know a smattering of
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
the responses I got in the couple of
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
hours uh yesterday after after I sent an
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
email to folks um but most certainly
 
02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
there is a problem and I will mention I
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
am very pleased to see that this audit
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
is being done by the Attorney General's
 
02:18:43.230 --> 02:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
office and I also met with the
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
investigator um to speak about that uh
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not familiar with any um
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
audit being done by the Attorney
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
General's office not the Attorney
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
General the only audit I know is being
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
done by the um the audit division of the
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislative I I sorry I I'm sorry I
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
believe it's an important difference
 
02:19:05.309 --> 02:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
yeah but I I did I spent two hours with
 
02:19:07.709 --> 02:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
two investigators from that office and
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
gave every bit of information I could
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
The Good the Bad and the Ugly um I would
 
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
just like to mention one other thing on
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
on the issue of whether or not I also
 
02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
have concerns on the process um and it's
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
interesting it's not that often that the
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
employee and the employer sided
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys agree on something but I
 
02:19:29.070 --> 02:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that there is a concern
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
and a problem that during the
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
investigations by the Human Rights
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
Commission they frequently do not
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
interview employees of the respondent
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
and in our case we had a case where the
 
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
case received a no probable cause
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
finding and the only person interviewed
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
in the case it was a race discrimination
 
02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
case the only person interviewed in that
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
whole case was the complainant not one
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
single employer witness was interviewed
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
and then a no probable cause finding was
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
issued we found that to be
 
02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
unconscionable so it is it is a grave
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
concern when when Witnesses are given by
 
02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
both sides I could not agree more with
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
my brethren on the other side of the
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
aisle that we should that the commission
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
should be investigating um employees on
 
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
both sides because oftentimes I will
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
tell you in discrimination cases you
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
might find this interesting but
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the complainant wants
 
02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
employer sided witnesses to be uh
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
interviewed because they're the ones who
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
have engaged in the discriminatory
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
conduct and and in the way these cases
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
go this might be helpful to you to just
 
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
sort of understand the process of sort
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
of how employment cases are analyzed
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
generally but the plaintiff first has to
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
make what's called a prima fascia case
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
which has to sort of give a minimum
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
outline that says for example uh in a
 
02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
gender discrimination case I'm a woman
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I was performing my job well I was
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
terminated uh from my employment and I
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
believe that gender played a role once
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff does that the burden
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
What's called the burden of production
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
shifts to a defendant to give a
 
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory non- retaliatory
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
reason for the termination if they're
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
able to show that the ultimate burden
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
moves back to the plaintiff to show that
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
the employer's stated reason was pretext
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
so often times most of the time really
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
the employee wants the commission to
 
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
talk to the employer Witnesses the the
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
employees of the employer to to find out
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
and essentially drill down on the
 
02:21:53.309 --> 02:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
employer's claimed reason for why they
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
terminated the employee the employee
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
says it's discriminatory the employer
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
says it's non-discriminatory but often
 
02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
times there's no written warnings
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's no verbal warnings there's
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in the personnel file that would
 
02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
ever have warranted the termination of
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
the employment and that helps the
 
02:22:12.670 --> 02:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
employee show pretext and that's why
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important that that
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
Witnesses on the employer side get
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
interviewed red and if there were
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
changes that could be made uh internally
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh you know a a revision
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the statute or
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
regulations uh that would absolutely
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
unequivocally require that uh employer
 
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
Witnesses be interviewed I I I know the
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
employee council would be very happy to
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
well so I guess in addition to that do
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
you have any other recommendations that
 
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
you think may help to
 
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
fix the issues that we're hearing about
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
cases I I really wish that the period of
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
time could be drastically shortened
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
between the time a charge is filed at
 
02:23:12.590 --> 02:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
the commission and when the investigator
 
02:23:15.790 --> 02:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
is even first assigned I feel that when
 
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
you go into sort of a hold period that
 
02:23:21.309 --> 02:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
could be a year or more long that's
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
problematic I actually uh emailed my
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
colleague back at my office to ask her
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
about a case that we have filed at the
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
commission right now we filed it in July
 
02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:32.230 align:start position:0%
commission right now we filed it in July
of

02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
2022 still not assigned to an
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
investigator yet now it's October and a
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
couple of days so it's been 14 months at
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
this point still not assigned to an
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
investigator it's it's just too long of
 
02:23:49.030 --> 02:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
a period before anything happens in the
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
case and of course over time people's
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
memories fade and so when I Echo what
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
attorney Reed said when he said that
 
02:23:59.469 --> 02:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
Justice delayed is Justice denied I
 
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more and so if these
 
02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
cases sit so that that an investigator
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
isn't even talking to Witnesses for a
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
year or two years after the
 
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
Discrimination that's alleged has
 
02:24:15.309 --> 02:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
occurred that that works against
 
02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
everyone it works against the whole
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
system system when it takes that long
 
02:24:22.269 --> 02:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.429 --> 02:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
forward thank you does anybody have any
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions BR
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
Manos attorney Burns um if only
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
complaintants can remove cases does that
 
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
violation I don't think so I don't think
 
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.950 align:start position:0%
violation I don't think so I don't think
so

02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay I I think I'll let I'll let MCA
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
Chase speak to it if you if you don't
 
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
mind and F
 
02:24:56.190 --> 02:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
me um hi everyone Marissa Chase
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
executive director for the New Hampshire

Association for justice thank you
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative um representative Smith
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
you and I have been seeing this bill
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
since 2020 I believe and I appreciate
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
the efforts that it has kind of spurred
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
with looking into what's really going on
 
02:25:16.349 --> 02:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
at the Human Rights Commission and
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully I would request that this
 
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill this simple removal bill that has
 
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
become not so simple be reintroduced
 
02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
another time as subcommittees last
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
summer and the summer before unanimously
 
02:25:32.349 --> 02:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
also determined it should be and I'm
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
glad to see the performance audit review
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
is continuing um I've heard from so many
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
of our members that have been contacted
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
like Heather was um by the investigator
 
02:25:44.190 --> 02:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
at the audit in the audit division who
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
really are taking a lot of time asking
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
tough questions and gathering
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
information to make some recommendations
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
on perhaps streamlining and improving
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
processes at the Human Rights Commission
 
02:25:55.269 --> 02:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
I would respectfully request that those
 
02:25:58.110 --> 02:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
two things be kept separate um until we
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
have more information from that
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:09.309 --> 02:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I'm being
 
02:26:13.349 --> 02:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
rude why would you think we should go
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
ahead and make a
 
02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.030 align:start position:0%
ahead and make a
change

02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
while the audit is going on is that a
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
little bit like rearranging the deck
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
Titanic just watched that movie not that
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
long ago
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe so because out of the
 
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
what almost 250 cases that the Human
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission sees yearly I have the
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
data that was sent to you back when it
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
was two sp29 96 and this past year house
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
bill this past by enum House Bill
 
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
362 and it really only affects on
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
average 12 people a year that's just 12
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
cases a year where the respondent
 
02:27:02.830 --> 02:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
employer removes to Superior Court after
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
a probable cause finding it is such a
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
narrow sliver that I think maybe we're
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
taking out one one desk chair on the
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
Titanic um but for those few people this
 
02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
is their life
 
02:27:20.429 --> 02:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
life that's that's why I think this
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
needs to happen because people
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
are having to start over in a terrible
 
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
place now and they have been well we've
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
been talking about this for four
 
02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
years I guess that's exactly my point
 
02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:38.790 align:start position:0%
years I guess that's exactly my point
and

02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh again I I know I'm I'm hung up on
 
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
this issue of what in fact the pending
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
case means but
 
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
timeline is unconscionable I
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
believe um and I don't think
 
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
anybody outside of the commission could
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with that I don't care which
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
side you're on it's
 
02:28:14.030 --> 02:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
unconscionable and this does
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
nothing to improve what is the
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
central problem of how the commission
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
operates or doesn't operate how its
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
procedures work how it documents how its
 
02:28:32.269 --> 02:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
procedures work how it reports to the
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
public about how its procedures work so
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
I don't see
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
why doing this before we attempt to look
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
at the entire problem accomplishes what
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
I think we all want
 
02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
including the the commissioner and that
 
02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
is to have the best possible human
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
relations commission that we could
 
02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
have I don't
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
disagree my initial ask in talking with
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislators and requesting this
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
legislation be filed was not to fix the
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission so that was not
 
02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission so that was not
my

02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:29:18.429 --> 02:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
goal however I will
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
say since we've been working on this and
 
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
talking about this for four
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
years uh Megan Douglas and Samantha
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
hearing who have come along with me and
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
Heather and Lauren all these four years
 
02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
did make
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations when asked so it I don't
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
believe it's fair to say that we haven't
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
been thinking about and contributing
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
ideas to how timelines may be improved
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
um Megan and Samantha actually drafted I
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
believe with the input of your office as
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
well Heather like a draft quarterly time
 
02:29:53.790 --> 02:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
sheet with um I can resend it um to the
 
02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee but I know I've sent it to
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary Committee um you know
 
02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
with with appropriate benchmarks on
 
02:30:03.389 --> 02:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
where like how many months for an
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
investigator to um be assigned how long
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
that investigation should be
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
Etc I'm not an investigator for the
 
02:30:10.750 --> 02:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission I don't know how
 
02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
viable that is but we asked for
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
something that I believe was really
 
02:30:18.750 --> 02:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
narrow it's become a larger issue that I
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
understand from where you're sitting you
 
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
want to fix I be I would be happy to be
 
02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:25.190 align:start position:0%
want to fix I be I would be happy to be
your

02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:30:29.710 --> 02:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
constituent um so we have been engaging
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
with ideas to try to make this better
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
even though it's been outside the scope
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
of what we initially requested and I
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
also just want to add a followup on due
 
02:30:41.309 --> 02:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
process and fairness rights it used to
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
be the case in New Hampshire where the
 
02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
complainant was the only entity that
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
could remove um after a probable cause
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
finding the respondent did not have that
 
02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
right right I say right lightly because
 
02:30:54.750 --> 02:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
the right of a respondent to choose
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
Forum does not exist that has been
 
02:30:59.790 --> 02:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
upheld by the massachusett state supreme
 
02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
court the federal Supreme Court the
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
plaintive decides where they get to
 
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
complain across the board um New
 
02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire jumped the gun in the was late
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
' 90s or mid somewhere between uh late
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
'90s and mid 2000s when Massachusetts
 
02:31:16.439 --> 02:31:17.590 align:start position:0%
'90s and mid 2000s when Massachusetts
was

02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:19.469 align:start position:0%
was
proposing

02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
um when when this their law was being
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
challenged um that only allowed the
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
complainant to bring to the Supreme to
 
02:31:29.710 --> 02:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
the superior to remove from their Human
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission process so New
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire jumped the gun did something
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
we don't like to do which is follow
 
02:31:38.349 --> 02:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts lead and we added
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
preemptively before that case was
 
02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
decided a right for the respondent to
 
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
also remove fearing that our system
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
would be challenged as
 
02:31:48.429 --> 02:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
well Massachusetts upheld their
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.349 --> 02:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
um I think at this point I um I'd like
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
to hear did were you able to get that
 
02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
data for us okay um thank you both for
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
coming and speaking I very much
 
02:32:12.319 --> 02:32:13.590 align:start position:0%
coming and speaking I very much
appreciate

02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:15.269 align:start position:0%
appreciate
it

02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:32:15.279 --> 02:32:19.830 align:start position:0%
it
um

02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh the oldest case that is
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
currently assigned is dated
 
02:32:40.110 --> 02:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
2019 um that case there were some issues
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
with that one there was a um bankruptcy
 
02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
and so bankruptcy stops process is and
 
02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes with that so
 
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
2019 and what is the oldest case that
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
has been filed not the oldest case
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's been assigned but the oldest case
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
that has where a complainant has come to
 
02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
that has where a complainant has come to
the

02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
commission I don't know I will have to
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
ask this all comes down to differences
 
02:33:20.269 --> 02:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
of um definition of terms because to me
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
the timeline starts when the complainant
 
02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
goes to the very place that they believe
 
02:33:29.670 --> 02:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
will help them it does the timeline does
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
not start at the time that that very
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
place the commission for whatever reason
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
begin whether the reason is lack of
 
02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
resources lack of money lack of Staff
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
whatever but it the time doesn't begin
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
at the point that the Comm
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
commission starts its investigation it
 
02:33:53.309 --> 02:33:53.319 align:start position:0%
starts when the case was filed and I
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
would very much appreciate if you could
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
get that information and and um you know
 
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
I thought that is what she was answering
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
though no she just said I think that
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
that that is the answer so if it's the
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
oldest case at the commission then
 
02:34:11.070 --> 02:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the oldest one that
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
was filed with the commission as
 
02:34:17.150 --> 02:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
well because but you said it was the
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
oldest case um that was pending and your
 
02:34:23.950 --> 02:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
definition of pending no I'm sorry the
 
02:34:27.389 --> 02:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
question I thought was um of the cases
 
02:34:30.349 --> 02:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
that are assigned to investigators what
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
is the oldest case that's not my
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
question my question is what is the
 
02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
oldest case in terms of when someone who
 
02:34:44.110 --> 02:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
needed help went to the commission and
 
02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
said here I am
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
so that's that is that's the 2019 case
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I would have to find out
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
what year um that was filed which I'm
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
happy to do um but it would be it's the
 
02:35:01.309 --> 02:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
answer to both questions is in the same
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
case I see all right I had didn't know
 
02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be the answer to and and I
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
you just so we understood correctly
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
though there was two spreadsheets one of
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheets is for pending cases
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
meaning they haven't been assigned to an
 
02:35:16.750 --> 02:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
investigator yet and then there's a
 
02:35:19.230 --> 02:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
second spreadsheet that lists all of the
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
cases that have been assigned to the
 
02:35:22.110 --> 02:35:22.120 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and in checking the
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that had the assigned cases
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
the oldest was 2019 and in checking the
 
02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
one that had the oldest pending cases
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
that was May of 2022 is that correct and
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
there's no older cases that exist in the
 
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
commission at all that have not been
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
closed correct Madam chair but
 
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
I I I think I must be totally off base
 
02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:46.469 align:start position:0%
I I I think I must be totally off base
because

02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
what I couldn't understand
 
02:35:54.670 --> 02:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
um from the witness is that her
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
definition of pending
 
02:36:02.590 --> 02:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
cases um were those cases that had begun
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
the process of Investigation no pending
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
meant waiting to be assigned to an
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
investigator and I promise you the the
 
02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that I have of pending
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
versus investigating it is the exact
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
same conversation that I've had before
 
02:36:19.309 --> 02:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
not just the subcommittee but the
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and in explaining how we do
 
02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
our cases and all of that it's the exact
 
02:36:27.550 --> 02:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
same thing so that hasn't changed it's
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
been the same conversation that we've
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
had a pending file case is one that is
 
02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
waiting to be assigned an assigned case
 
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
is one that is currently being
 
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
investigated or assigned to an
 
02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
investigator to be investigated so to
 
02:36:43.349 --> 02:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
answer your question representative
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
Smith 2019 is the case that is very
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you things take so long I
 
02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
mean I'm sitting here and thinking about
 
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
you and your incredible need for more
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
staff and knowing how long the process
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
takes to uh to hire to to find
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate people to hire and to go
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
through the time it takes to get someone
 
02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
hired I guess I'm a little confused
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
about why you wouldn't have started that
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
process knowing that that's not going to
 
02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
be finished by the end of October when
 
02:37:25.389 --> 02:37:25.399 align:start position:0%
you move um so in each of the things
 
02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the the balls that you're juggling
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
and you have so many balls that you have
 
02:37:34.349 --> 02:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
um I know that time is is is pressing on
 
02:37:42.910 --> 02:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
you um and I so I would think you would
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
be moving right away to try to find
 
02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:46.950 align:start position:0%
be moving right away to try to find
people

02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh to fill those vacancies we know all
 
02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
across the state vacancies are not being
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
filled for whatever reason whether
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
people don't want to work for the state
 
02:37:57.389 --> 02:37:57.399 align:start position:0%
or they're not paying enough or whatever
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
so I mean I
 
02:38:03.309 --> 02:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
would I would not want you to have to
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
wait till the end of October to even
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
start the process so I'm I I want to do
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
what we can do to help you sure I
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate that they also need a place
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
to sit but my point is they don't need a
 
02:38:19.349 --> 02:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
place to sit until they're hired and
 
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
they are not going to be hired the day
 
02:38:24.190 --> 02:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
you post the openings there's going to
 
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
be a long delay from the day you post
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
the openings until they are hired and
 
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
need a place to sit and
 
02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
um if by a miracle you have people
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
immediately call you the moment you post
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
which I don't think is likely but
 
02:38:47.469 --> 02:38:47.479 align:start position:0%
possible they're not going to be hired
 
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
within 30 days because it takes longer
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
than that and so you start the process
 
02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
the moment that you've been given the
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity which was actually now two
 
02:39:02.590 --> 02:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
months three months ago um and it's the
 
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
same thing with with all of these you
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
know you take the opportunities that are
 
02:39:07.469 --> 02:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
presented to you because you're not
 
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
getting enough opportunities to help you
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
do all the job that you want to do and
 
02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:14.630 align:start position:0%
do all the job that you want to do and
I'm

02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.230 align:start position:0%
I'm
just

02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
belaboring I'm going to stop it would be
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
great to be able to be set up I think um
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
attorney REI mentioned uh mcad which is
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts commission against
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination um and they have three
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
offices and I think there's either three
 
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
or four in Connecticut um to have you
 
02:39:36.349 --> 02:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
know 100 staff members and a battery of
 
02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
attorneys and that would be
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
great it would simplify it would
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
simplify the process available to you
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
that you have where you have they're
 
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
available to you and you haven't started
 
02:39:53.070 --> 02:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
you um what do you want to do with that
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to hear what are what are we
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
thinking that we that we should do at
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
this point what is everybody else kind
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
of thinking I'd like
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
to well I mean I agree I'm not sure
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
whether this statute makes much
 
02:40:12.269 --> 02:40:12.279 align:start position:0%
difference one way or the other to the
 
02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
systemic problems we've identified which
 
02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
is and it's a fairly small number of
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
cases and it's unclear to me if the
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
respondents even gain anything by taking
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court aside from just
 
02:40:25.469 --> 02:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
running the clock out and um but also
 
02:40:27.630 --> 02:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
say one extenda circumstance we're just
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
discussing you know the possibility of
 
02:40:31.150 --> 02:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
hiring more staff and the difficulties
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have and of course
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
they'll probably be hiring some of those
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
people away from mcad if they uh get but
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
that will probably lead to a smaller
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of workers who file
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
complaints to the Human Rights
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
Commission for the simple reason when
 
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage of workers that gives
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
the workers more leverage and the
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
employer will still have these problems
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
but the employee the employers are
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
probably going to be less likely to let
 
02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
things deteriorate to the point where
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
this worker who's now much more valuable
 
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
than they've been considered in the past
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
will file the complaint to probably make
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
more of an effort to keep people happy
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
and prevent these situations from
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
happening so that will probably
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
slightly or maybe even significantly
 
02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
reduce the work for the workload going
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
forward for the commission but um I yes
 
02:41:19.469 --> 02:41:19.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether either this build
 
02:41:21.870 --> 02:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
we had two years ago really affects the
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
problems one way or the other so that's
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
Manos I'm very torn about it um I think
 
02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:36.830 align:start position:0%
Manos I'm very torn about it um I think
we

02:41:36.830 --> 02:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:41:39.389 --> 02:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
should perhaps schedule a time when we
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
can exec and Talk Amongst ourselves and
 
02:41:46.429 --> 02:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
do that formally okay I think that's
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
what isn't
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
that isn't that what you're proposing
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
right now that we think about is
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee ready to make a
 
02:41:57.389 --> 02:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
 
02:42:00.030 --> 02:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's what this is we don't have to
 
02:42:02.830 --> 02:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation uh the chair might
 
02:42:05.710 --> 02:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
decide um that we should have another
 
02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
meeting um as a subcommittee before we
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
then make a recommendation to the full
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee that recommendation will be
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
made on November 8th so we already know
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
that so we
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
have we do have some time to have
 
02:42:23.389 --> 02:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee meeting if we need
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
one but if we don't need one nobody
 
02:42:27.389 --> 02:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
needs an extra committee I think we
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
should have another subcommittee meeting
 
02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
should have another subcommittee meeting
on

02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:36.030 --> 02:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
Anders turn on your if you can turn on
 
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
your mic s that I have nothing against
 
02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:40.710 align:start position:0%
your mic s that I have nothing against
this

02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:42:44.110 --> 02:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
bill I'm different than I'm I'm an
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
action person
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
I don't like where we're at and I think
 
02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
we need another
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
meeting because I want to
 
02:42:56.429 --> 02:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
know how
 
02:43:00.590 --> 02:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
much can we change this current bill
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
we've got a problem and we need to take
 
02:43:06.269 --> 02:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
some action I know I'm new at this but I
 
02:43:08.990 --> 02:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
cannot sit on my hands forever knowing
 
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
things are the mess they're in to be
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
Point Blank and uh yeah I do think we
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
need another subcommittee meeting okay I
 
02:43:20.469 --> 02:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate that point I guess you have a
 
02:43:23.230 --> 02:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
lot of experience rep Smith so with your
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
experience let me ask you this let's say
 
02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
we decided we were going to slice out
 
02:43:30.510 --> 02:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
this part of the puzzle this this bill
 
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
could we once we got the findings from
 
02:43:37.389 --> 02:43:37.399 align:start position:0%
the um audit could we go to the rules
 
02:43:39.150 --> 02:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
committee to put in something bigger or
 
02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
would this be something where we would
 
02:43:44.030 --> 02:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
have to put it into this current bill um
 
02:43:46.830 --> 02:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
and would we have to would it be a non-
 
02:43:49.070 --> 02:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
gerine Amendment at that point because I
 
02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
don't know um we have to act on this
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill um by November 15th it will then go
 
02:44:01.309 --> 02:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
to the floor of the house and either on
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
the 3 the fourth or perhaps the 11th um
 
02:44:10.110 --> 02:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
the full house has to act I do not
 
02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
believe I don't know cuz I you know once
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
we make the request we stay out of
 
02:44:19.389 --> 02:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that the uh performance
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
audit would be finished by January of
 
02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
2024 um if it were
 
02:44:34.110 --> 02:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
finished in January or February or March
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
though this is unlikely at that point we
 
02:44:38.670 --> 02:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
could go to the rules committee with the
 
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
new information and asked to file a new
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
bill but by then we passed all the
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
deadlines of you know of introducing
 
02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislation so I believe it is going to
 
02:44:50.910 --> 02:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
be the next
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
legislature will uh that will have the
 
02:44:59.630 --> 02:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
benefit of of the performance audit and
 
02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
could uh help us look at the larger
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
picture oh
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we would have that now
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they will not nor should they give
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
us a preliminary report they will not
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
give us anything until they have done as
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
complete an investigation as possible
 
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the reasons that
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
their performance audits are so valuable
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
um you know that they they don't broke
 
02:45:31.990 --> 02:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
interference from anyone and they they
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
only when they finish do they present it
 
02:45:37.710 --> 02:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
to the legislative to the fiscal
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
committee for the fiscal committee to
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
accept or not accept
 
02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
so we're on our own if we wanted to make
 
02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:49.110 align:start position:0%
so we're on our own if we wanted to make
changes

02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
now whether it's this change or any
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
other change we could make it in this
 
02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
other change we could make it in this
bill

02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:46:00.429 --> 02:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
or we could choose not to but I don't
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
audit let me ask the our staff
 
02:46:15.790 --> 02:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
researcher if I miss represented
 
02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:32.269 align:start position:0%
researcher if I miss represented
anything

02:46:32.269 --> 02:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.279 --> 02:46:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.670 --> 02:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
right so I guess if we're not going to
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
get the report in the meantime to be
 
02:46:43.630 --> 02:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
able to try and make a bigger change
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
which is ultimately really what we
 
02:46:48.790 --> 02:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
needed do we think that going forward
 
02:46:50.429 --> 02:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
with this current
 
02:46:50.439 --> 02:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
with this current
change

02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
and rather it's in its current form or
 
02:47:04.269 --> 02:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
sense or do we think we need time to
 
02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
think on that and
 
02:47:10.950 --> 02:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
regroup I think we need time to think on
 
02:47:13.830 --> 02:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
it and regroup okay I did want to bring
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
up one part just for consideration um as
 
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's thinking these things
 
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
through so that that way the next time
 
02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
we come together that we've kind of all
 
02:47:24.309 --> 02:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
had time to consider each part we've
 
02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
only heard from the employment
 
02:47:28.349 --> 02:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
employment side of this the HRC does
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
accept four different types of cases
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
employer housing public education and
 
02:47:35.950 --> 02:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
public accommodations and so where we
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from the housing education
 
02:47:41.469 --> 02:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
or public accommodation side I would
 
02:47:44.670 --> 02:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
be really apprehensive to make a change
 
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
to to that part of the law without even
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
hearing that it's a problem that those
 
02:47:50.349 --> 02:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
cases are being removed and that we need
 
02:47:54.349 --> 02:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
to do anything with that so I
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
would my opinion would be if we were
 
02:47:58.510 --> 02:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to make any changes with the bill
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
going forward we would specify that that
 
02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:01.950 align:start position:0%
going forward we would specify that that
change

02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:48:05.230 --> 02:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
would um be for only the employer type
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
case because we haven't heard that
 
02:48:09.309 --> 02:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
there's a problem in those other three
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
in in regard to this particular area
 
02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
with the removal of the cases and I
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't think we should change something
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
that nobody's brought to us that it's
 
02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
broken and needs to be changed if it's
 
02:48:21.790 --> 02:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
not fixed don't if it's not broken don't
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
fix it type of a type of a situation
 
02:48:26.670 --> 02:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
there and I I'm worried about unintended
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of it ref Horan well the uh
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm just looking at the uh
 
02:48:36.190 --> 02:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
the bill report you sent me so I was the
 
02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
one naysayer who voted against the
 
02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
interim study most in um in the spring
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
of 2022 and my I let it go through and
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
consent I I think my opinion at the time
 
02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
was that yes there's a problem this bill
 
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't fix it one way or the other so I
 
02:48:53.269 --> 02:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
think I I thought it time I think I
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
should have thought it would have been
 
02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
itl but I went along with it and then
 
02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
ironically here I'm on the retained Bill
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm still leaning in the
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
same direction but if I think we can I
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
think we can consider any Amendment we
 
02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
want to so it's up first of all the full
 
02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
committee discover a whether it's a good
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment and B whether it's uh Germaine
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
and then you know the clerk speaker's
 
02:49:17.150 --> 02:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
office can weigh in on whether or not in
 
02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
fact a ger main Amendment and we can go
 
02:49:21.389 --> 02:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
from there but I think certainly at this
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
point I'm not I'm not sure whether I'm
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
not sure whether we can arrive at a
 
02:49:27.229 --> 02:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment acceptable to the whole
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee and then you know to everyone
 
02:49:31.870 --> 02:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
else involved but like I think we can we
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
can I don't think we have to worry too
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
much about whether it's a Germaine
 
02:49:36.190 --> 02:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's for somebody else to
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
worry about although um so probably the
 
02:49:42.269 --> 02:49:42.279 align:start position:0%
probably the changes you have in mind
 
02:49:44.190 --> 02:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
probably would be a Germaine Amendment
 
02:49:46.269 --> 02:49:46.279 align:start position:0%
but whether or not not whether it's it's
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
necessary is is another issue which is
 
02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think we could decide today
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
in any case the whole committee and then
 
02:49:55.349 --> 02:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate will have to do
 
02:49:57.790 --> 02:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
decide decide that
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
but okay so I'm hearing that we need to
 
02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
come together to meet again and that
 
02:50:04.349 --> 02:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
we're not going to make a any
 
02:50:08.190 --> 02:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation today I I think we had a
 
02:50:10.269 --> 02:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
we have a work session I think scheduled
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
first um on the 8th and then the 15th as
 
02:50:14.269 --> 02:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
the exact but we may exact some of the
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
bills on the E is that correct my
 
02:50:20.670 --> 02:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
understanding from the chair
 
02:50:23.349 --> 02:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
um the chair is on
 
02:50:28.590 --> 02:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
the on the eth um the work session is on
 
02:50:32.830 --> 02:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
all the bills if there are any bills
 
02:50:38.349 --> 02:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
where there is um unanimous
 
02:50:38.359 --> 02:50:41.309 align:start position:0%
where there is um unanimous
agreement

02:50:41.309 --> 02:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:50:45.750 --> 02:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
um the chair at his discretion with the
 
02:50:47.710 --> 02:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
ranking members
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
approval might call for a vote on the
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
eth he will not call for a vote on the
 
02:50:58.349 --> 02:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
eth for any bill that in any way is
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
contentious and the reason for that is
 
02:51:02.990 --> 02:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
that some members of the committee are
 
02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
not able will not be able to be there on
 
02:51:08.229 --> 02:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
the 8th and rather than have to go
 
02:51:09.990 --> 02:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
through the process of getting a
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
substitute when in fact the substitute
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
in the end might not be needed the
 
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
agreement is we would only vote if both
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
Bob and I agree on bills that are
 
02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
completely unanimous on the 8th then
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
that way we won't have to address them
 
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:51:30.269 --> 02:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
15th um so that's what I understand is
 
02:51:31.630 --> 02:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
going to happen on the eth one thing
 
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
that occurs to me and I don't know if
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
this works we're all struggling with a
 
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
lot of subcommittee and other bills I'm
 
02:51:43.229 --> 02:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
wondering if it's possible for us to
 
02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
come in at 9:00
 
02:51:48.229 --> 02:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
the morning of the
 
02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
8th to come up with our
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
final suggestion um or if you think
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
work I'm not available I think I'm 90%
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not available on
 
02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
the actually I believe representative
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
that you're one of the reasons I
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
told um the chair that
 
02:52:15.359 --> 02:52:16.910 align:start position:0%
told um the chair that
um

02:52:16.910 --> 02:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
several members were not going to be
 
02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
available on the 8th and he said that
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know so that therefore I didn't want
 
02:52:26.630 --> 02:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
any votes and that's when we agreed to
 
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
have votes only where there was
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
unanimity so you're right that's not a
 
02:52:32.750 --> 02:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
good choice so I think we do have you
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
know potential conflicts on Tuesdays
 
02:52:37.150 --> 02:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
with our our special committee and
 
02:52:39.870 --> 02:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
whatnot so I guess perhaps is there a
 
02:52:41.950 --> 02:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
Thursday that we could meet before like
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:53.469 --> 02:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
26th how did we get to
 
02:52:58.229 --> 02:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:58.239 --> 02:53:04.190 align:start position:0%
 
fast

02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
um does anybody want to meet at 1
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon now I have a
 
02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
committee meeting on the 18th in the
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
morning and maybe we could just have
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
ours a second one it's just a
 
02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion well we have it there is a
 
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary subcommittee on the 18th a 10
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
396 that's my bill I'm going to
 
02:53:35.550 --> 02:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
do um 19th doesn't work for me but the
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
well but so one on the 18th is I was
 
02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about that maybe we could do it
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
and get it done on one
 
02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:47.160 align:start position:0%

02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:53:58.990 --> 02:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
