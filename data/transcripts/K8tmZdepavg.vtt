bill to the committee this morning good
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%

chairman and thank you committee members
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
um I am here actually representing uh
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative Ron Dunn as he was unable
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
to make it here today to present this
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
bill to you um presently so this bill
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
would establish a commission to study
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
issues related to the growth traffic and
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
planning and land use for certain towns
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
and it's actually taking 10 Towns um
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
that some are from different planning
 
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
committees and the reason um I'll get
 
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
into a little bit why but presently as
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
you I'm you all know presently uh
 
00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
Rockingham uh Planning Commission serves
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
27 towns nashwa 13 towns Southern New
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire planning serves 14 towns
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
currently the nine Regional planning
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
commissions they serve on an advisory
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
only to the local towns and with the
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
goal of promoting growth use and
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
transportation and Environmental
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
Protection this commission would examine
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
several things it would look at the
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
purpose and direction of the nine uh
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
planning commissions it would also
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps offer an option to
 
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
reconfigures in the nine planning
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
commissions so that they would better
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
serve the to um they would better serve
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
each town and also do we possibly need
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
to redraw the map for the nine rate
 
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
Regional plannings to better serve each
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
town this bill um was requested by
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
multiple sever a bit ago um by several
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
um residents in London AR which I um
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
represent and the town manager at the
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
town as well as several of the Town
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
counselor it takes towns with similar
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
locations size and
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
development to share and um to share
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
best practices so this will be a
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
temporary commission to last only until
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
the goal could be accomplished to offer
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the um existing
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
commissions so
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
I know commissions are not popular right
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
now but these towns have been selected
 
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding according to
 
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
representative Dunn because they are
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
looking at um growth um transportation
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
issues um traffic issues they're looking
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
at a lot of very similar issues that
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
perhaps the commission that they might
 
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
be part the planning uh group that they
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
might be in
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
they don't all have those problems so
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
that's basically to bring these together
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
to try to see how we can best
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
accommodate these and perhaps look at
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
how redoing some of the things might um
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
serve all the all the residents and all
 
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.190 align:start position:0%
serve all the all the residents and all
the

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
communities I will take questions from
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
you all I hope I can answer them I'm
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that the gentlemen behind me may
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
have more information than me so thank
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Perez are
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
Perez had a question so I see in this
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
this bill that this is for to establish
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
a commission to do a study correct and
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
on page two Roman numeral six it the
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
commission will report findings to the
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'm trying to understand
 
00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
what type of legislation might come out
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
of this commission as opposed to the
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
whole purpose is to study Solutions
 
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
right for growth traffic planning and
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
land use
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
so could could these purposes be
 
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
accomplished at the local level through
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
ordinances in and to help me to
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
understand the answer to that question
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of what type of
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislation might be
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
needed I can tell you honestly I do not
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
my only thought might be and I'm all for
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
local representation and local
 
00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:39.069 align:start position:0%
local representation and local
ordinances

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I are the commissions pardon my
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
ignorance on this but are these are the
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
planning um are the planning commissions
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
are they established via
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and if they are would
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
legislation have to be enacted to
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps readjust them or reconfigure
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
them so that's
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
my somewhat uninformed possibility
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
answer thank you further
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Jama is
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
question um the question I have is to do
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
with the cities that were decided on
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
this okay do we know um what group or
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
who decided on these cities and I can
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
see that there's no um like Lebanon or
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
Kean or any of those kind of Western
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
cities and wanted to know if there's
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
kind of maybe an amendment possibility
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
for that well I think it's my
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
understanding and according to
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative Dunn is that these um
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
towns share common locality as far as
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
one of them is the uh access to Southern
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh Route 93 was one of
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
them um these um when Ron reached out
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
through um commissions through the
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
these were towns it's my understanding
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
that specifically asked to be part of it
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
because of their similarities in
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
location as well as
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
um what's going on in the towns as far
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
as their growth I know London Dairy we H
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're having mega growth right now um
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
and we have um transport big
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
transportation in issues um traffic
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
issues I should say so I think these
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
towns felt that they were similar in a
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the ideas now marac doesn't
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily access 93 but it does but it
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
also has route three so I think that was
 
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.750 align:start position:0%
also has route three so I think that was
the

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
reasoning representative frock is
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
recognize for a question thank you madam
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
um I just want to reiterate my
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of the purpose of this
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
commission um
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
these 10 Towns are currently in
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
different Regional planning commissions
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding some and they
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
are desirous because of common needs to
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
be in a single Regional Planning
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
Commission is that correct not
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily not necessarily that would
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
be up to being the
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
commission they are what this commission
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
would do is see if that was an option to
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
redistrict or replan planning
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
Commissions in order to accommodate
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
towns better for example um some of the
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
towns have uh like like nasua has I
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
think 13 um 13 towns um I don't know if
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
small towns is maybe perhaps Brookline
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
is part of the nashille one you know
 
00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:54.629 align:start position:0%
is part of the nashille one you know
what

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
is can a commission that's looking at a
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
city of Nashville
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
also directly meet the needs of a town
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
with much fewer
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative majority is
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chairwoman
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
growth is both residential growth and
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
Commercial growth because you said
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
there's explosive growth so I just want
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's it's both of them is
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
right additional
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
power good morning and welcome to
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chair and
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members uh for
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Eric power I'm
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
from Brookline I also Ser been serving
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
on the Brookline planning board since
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
2021 so I'm going to my fifth year and
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking in favor of House Bill
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
471 I think it's a good bill having
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
experience on planning the planning
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
board um I can see the need for this for
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
these towns these towns are all um in
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
and around the uh Manchester and nsha
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
areas south C central New Hampshire and
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
as such they share a lot of common uh
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
needs that it's a system here you got to
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
think of it I'm a system engineer um for
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
my uh professional background but it's a
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
system here with all these towns and
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
there they're spanning three different
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions um
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
Brookline and the towns west of nsha and
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
Two Towns East are in the regional
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission National Regional
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission but you also have
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Regional Planning Commission
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
represented in Southern New Hampshire
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission so um when
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
things happen within the regional
 
00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission there's some um
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
ability there to work but when things
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
start spanning across uh Regional
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
planning commissions that gets a little
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
more difficult and so um whenever we
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
look at a project in U in our town one
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
of the things that's on our checklist is
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
we have to go through and do uh a
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
finding if this is a development of
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
regional impact
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
um and that's an important thing to do
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
and most of them are not but
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
occasionally you'll get one maybe it's
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
on the edge of town we also border
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so we have that that that
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
situation as well but when you have a
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
development of regional impact you have
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
to work with the other towns if you find
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
that have that finding it gets a little
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
bit more challenging when you cross over
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
the boundaries um of the uh Regional
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
planning commissions so I think it makes
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense um for them to have the
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
this Commission because they all share
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the 93 and Route three corridors and
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of residential growth
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of commercial growth and I
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
think them cooperating in a commission
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
like this makes a lot of sense they get
 
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
a common understanding and I think what
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
would come out of it and I would
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
recommend in maybe in in paragraph six
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
if if you found necessary um I think
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't just be necessarily
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation proposed
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
legislation may help Drive the State
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
Highway plan if this commission had some
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
findings because obviously they're
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
dealing a lot with the highways but you
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
could also and it might be a
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
reconfiguration of the regional planning
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
commissions if it made sense maybe we
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
need a tenth one in New Hampshire and
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
takes into account that center part of
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that might be something
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
that comes out of it I'm just saying
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
that as a possibility but there might
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
also be projects of regional impact that
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
get identified as a re as part of this
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
commission that would be something that
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
could be um wouldn't have to be
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
legislation but it would actually set at
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
the stage for them to cooperate on on
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
plans would wouldn't necessarily need
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
reg uh this um legislation to do it but
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
they would actually the commission would
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
have that good and I think if these 10
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
Towns really want to get together and do
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
this I think it makes a lot of sense to
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
enable us by a commission and it also
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
has the piece of having legislators you
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
know they they're not mandating a state
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative to be a member although
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
they can be but it's a member of it's
 
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:30.039 align:start position:0%
it's a state representative a town
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
council member or a select board member
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
or even a planning board member from
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
each of the towns making up this
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
commission so I think they've let it
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
made it flexible to meet make meet the
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
needs of south southern New Hampshire
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons I would recommend
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
a to pass or a to pass with Amendment on
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 471 and that concludes my
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll take questions thank
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair and
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
um have you looked at RSA
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
3646 which does what you're asking to do
 
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.870 align:start position:0%
3646 which does what you're asking to do
in

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
this I have not looked at 3646 no I
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative J
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I wanted to know
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
do you think that we could make this
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill more broad so other cities maybe in
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
different locations could do this within
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
themselves as well and we don't have to
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
keep coming back to passing the same
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
thing just for different
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
cities thank you representative for the
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
question I think there's probably other
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that are probably
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing similar growth but they're
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
not in this Locust here but you know I
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
think about the Upper Valley I think of
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and Hanover Enfield that area
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
they and then maybe they have to
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
consider their neighbors across Austin
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont um that might be something that
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
would be worthy if this became a bill
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
that would make this an easier process
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps RSA 3646 allows this in some way
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
I think that has to be looked at by the
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee but uh and maybe even you know
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
you look at the Mount Washington Valley
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
up in Conway in that area I'm thinking
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the the growth that's happening up
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
there um if you don't plan these things
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
if the planning boards and the the the
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
governing bodies don't plan good things
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
might not happen but if they do
 
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:30.919 align:start position:0%
um if you have these sort of
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
cooperations I think it would make a lot
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
of sense so I would agree if you can
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
find a mechanism to allow these
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
commissions to happen um you may not get
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
the the only thing you wouldn't get is
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the uh contribution of the state
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
representatives necessarily and that's
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
why this one that's why this proposal is
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
good but you have to kind of wrestle
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
with that a little bit I think the
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
intent is good I think everybody
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably agrees about it but is is you
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
know how how do we make these happen and
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
how do they make them easier to happen
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
across the state to have the cooperation
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
we're looking
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
for representative stavis has a question
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I apologize to
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and uh to you for being
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
late this morning um thank you for
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um following up on my
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
colleague Julie Gilman's question 3646
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
specific specifically provides a
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism for two or more towns in the
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
state to create a regional Planning
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
Commission so again I'm going to ask why
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
this is necessary when the mechanism to
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
do what it wants to do already exists in
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
law thank you for the question I am not
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with the a regional Planning
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
Commission I think is formed by
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
legislation if it's maybe a slightly
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
different term um because there's nine
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
every town belongs to one of nine
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions so you
 
00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
can't be in two of them at the same time
 
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
as my understanding um so maybe it's a
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
different term maybe there's a different
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
kind of commission that they could they
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
could stand up um so if that exists
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
maybe that that would be something that
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
here representative Colby is recognized
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam chair
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
um one very strange thing and it goes
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
back to the makeup and the selection of
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
of the towns um town that have been left
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
out but are a
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
Butters if you will using a planning
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
board term um Dunbarton for example uh
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
is laying in between gtown and
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
hookit um
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
plastow uh also missing from the list
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
even though very close to Windom and
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
sharing uh traffic
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
patterns um is there any concern that
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
these towns will feel strong armed um by
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
communities by being left out of the
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you for the question
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the um exact way that
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
they developed this list but I was you
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
know when I looked at it knowing the
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
geography a little bit I was looking at
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
it and I thought of dun Barton I my
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
brother used to live in Dunbarton so I
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
know the town also plastow that's sort
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
of in the same Corridor so they may want
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
to be at as asked if they want to be on
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
the list if the state reps want to maybe
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
be consulted because I think they it is
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
a system at some point you have to cut
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
it off but if you look at the the what
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
was selected um it might make sense to
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
include those at least those two
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
examples you would then have 12
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
communities when the commission gets a
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
little too large it may not be as
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
effective or it gets a little harder to
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
do things but uh you have to balance
 
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
that with not leaving folks out I think
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a good
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative frock is
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.310 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
madam

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
madam
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
chair um I notice on the list of
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
members that there's nobody representing
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
the three regional planning commissions
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
oversight thank you for the question I
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
was um that was another suggestion I was
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
going to make when I looked at this bill
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
I was not involved with this bill bill
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
at all I just happened to see it and
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to give my input as a planning
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
board member um that it would make sense
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
for I would say the commission to
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
include one person from each of those
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
three regional planning commissions I
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
think that would make a lot of synergy
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
happen and um if they were not voting
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
members at least they would be
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
Consulting members if you wanted to make
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
them that I think that would be a good
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh good thing to include is to have them
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
involved because it does span multiple
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission so good
 
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.669 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission so good
good

00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you Mr power additional
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman thank
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
another question um I believe the uh
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Planning Commission and the
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
southern district Planning Commission do
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
overlap and it was presented to the
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
exitor select
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
board to uh do you mind if we do this
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
sharing the same complex so um I guess
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
my question is still on chapter 36 of
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
the RFA is that what you're asking to do
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
established I don't know if that there's
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
a question there but I would say is it
 
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:48.990 align:start position:0%
a question there but I would say is it
already

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
established I do not I would not be able
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
to answer that specifically I the
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire I'm not I'm in
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
the National Regional Planning
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
Commission so I tend to know most of
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
that more than I know the adjacent ones
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
but um the Southern New Hampshire and
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham Regional planning
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
commissions uh would be pieces of this
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
and if you look at RSA 3646 and you
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
think that that's going to achieve the
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
same goal of what this legislation is

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.389 align:start position:0%
in Greenville in Hillsboro County
District

00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
36 this bill was filed to address
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in the law pertaining to
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
town property found under RSA
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
4111 col
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
11-a which I recognize during my
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
participation in a committee of
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
conference last legislative session
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
the problem that I found is There's no
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
practical provision under the current
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
law that allows for the lease of public
 
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
property for longer than 5 years
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
currently under this statute there are
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
only two options available the first is
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the statute gives Selectmen the
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
blanket authority to rent or lease
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
unused public property for up to one
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
year and the second option that's
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
allowed under statute is that the legis
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
that the legislative body can vote to
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
authorize the Selectmen to be able to
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
enter into a lease for up to five years
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
and this um this vote by the legislative
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
body is done at an annual or a special
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
town meeting under current RSA for a
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
lease agreement of town property for a
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
time period longer than 5 years the
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
legislative body is required to come
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
back and every 5 years to reauthorize
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
that Authority for the select board to
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
continue leases otherwise the lease
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
terminates while this might make sense
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
for a number of cases it's impractical
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
in other cases and to explain I I would
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
like to offer two examples demonstrating
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
the um lack or the deficiency in the
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
current law so the most recent example
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
is um with regards to the half a billion
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
dollar Hampton Beach Casino ballroom
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment project that was um being
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
proposed last year and um so what what
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
was going on there is that the town of
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
Hampton wanted to lease or enter into a
 
00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:18.509 align:start position:0%
Hampton wanted to lease or enter into a
long-term

00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
lease with the abutter of a very short
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
um road that was less than a tenth of a
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
mile in Hampton and under current law
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative body could only
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
authorize the town to lease this and it
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
for this short bit of road that was
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
unused could only be in 5year increments
 
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
um didn't make sense so as a result
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
every five years the legislative body
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
under the current law would like I said
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
would need to reauthorize the select
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
board to be able to continue the lease
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
for another five years again otherwise
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
the lease would
 
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.069 align:start position:0%
the lease would
terminate

00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
terminate
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
and the second example um occurred in
 
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.470 align:start position:0%
and the second example um occurred in
2018

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
where the voters in Brookline passed a
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
warrant article to allow the select
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
board to lease Parcels of town property
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
that were situated around a pond in town
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
to multiple tenants for a term of 13
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
years and so since the lease was 13
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
years which is greater than 5 years the
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
RSA 4111 a requires that the voters come
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
back every 5 years in order to be able
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
to give theth authority to the select
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
board to be able to continue um the
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
leases after that initial warrant
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
article had been approved by the
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
legislative body so as a result last
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
year in 2024 at town meeting we had a
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
warrant article to allow the Selectmen
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
to extend those leases for another five
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
years because you can only go five years
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
which was passed by voters and now in
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
2029 the voters will see an additional
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
warrant article again to allow the
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
selectman to continue the to further
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
extend the lease for an additional 3
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
years in order to get to the 13 years
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
which had been approved by the voters so
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
um additionally I conducted some
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
research and I have this handout which
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
lists 12 examples of proposed um warrant
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
articles for Town property leases that
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
exceed 5 years so I feel that there is a
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
demonstration ated need for this um
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
change in statute so the solution is the
 
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
bill which addresses the problem by
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
adding a provision that allows for the
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
legislative body by a vote at an annual
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
or special meeting to be able to
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
authorize the select board the ability
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
to rent or lease unused Town property
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
for more than a year so um to briefly ex
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
summarize the the changes that this bill
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
373 makes is under section one the
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
default Authority for the town um select
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
board to manage Town property is Remains
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
the Same I just changed the word to be
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
consistent with other um parts of
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
Statute and then in section three I mean
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
section two that's that's uh reorganized
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
in new section so under section two the
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
authority to rent or leas town property
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
is provided under three options lines 11
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
through 12 under a if the lease is less
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
than a year then the select board has
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
the authority to enter into any such
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
lease in lines 13 through 21 if the
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
lease is greater than a year then the
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body shall vote to give the
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
select board the authority to enter into
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
that specific lease and the vote
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
threshold for approval is a 3- fifths
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
majority by ballot and then under
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
Section Roman numeral 3 is the option
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
provision which is currently in law in
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
which the legislative body may vote to
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
give the select board the authority to
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
lease any Town property for up to five
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
years that's a blanket Authority and
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's um optional and
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
enabling and again the vote threshold is
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
a three-fifths majority to by ballot to
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
adopt as well as to resend this 5year
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
Authority and also if the legislative
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
body votes to send the authority
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
importantly any existing leases shall um
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
remain valid in in effect so to conclude
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
the bill maintains the ability of the
 
00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
select board to lease property for less
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
than a year it grants the select board
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to lease a specific property
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
for more than a year but less than 99
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
years by a 3- fifths majority vote of
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
the legislative body and 9 year 99 years
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
is just it's a it's a legal um I guess
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
term or time period that means a longer
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
period of
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
time and then lastly the bill preserves
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
The Five-Year gr Grant of leasing
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
authority of any Town property to the
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
select board but with a three-fifths
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
majority vote of the legislative body so
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge the committee
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
to recommend House Bill 373 local op to
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
pass thank you Mr chairman and I'm happy
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you Vice chair uh and thank
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
question I'm concerned as to how we went
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
from uh statement of ratified by vote of
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
required

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
so could you reference the line number
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
all right um so line number nine crosses
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
out uh shall not be valid unless
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
ratified by vote of the Town correct
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um and then we changed that
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
provision to say uh that now we're
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
putting a threshold on voting so now the
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
vote has to be a 3- fifths
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
majority correct so the the original
 
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.150 align:start position:0%
majority correct so the the original
bill

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
the the original statute has by vote of
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the town which implies that it's a
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
simple majority so I thought that it was
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
important and so by virtue of Statute
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
like I had um outlined that the select
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
board has the authority to rent or lease
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
unused property for up to a year so then
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
we have that we have the scenario where
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
you the the the legislative body May
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
Grant blanket Authority for a time
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
period for up to five
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
so we have that and then in what this
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill is is trying to address is that
 
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
that Gap in between so due to the fact
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
that it's greater it's we're talking
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
about a a lease agreement that's greater
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
than five years this is a long-term um
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
commitment and Authority so I felt that
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
it was important
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
to to have a majority super majority a
 
00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
three- fifths rather than just a simple
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
majority so um cuz if we're talking
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
about like say for example the the
 
00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:06.790 align:start position:0%
about like say for example the the
Hampton

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
Hampton
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
Road situation that that's that's that's
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
serious so I I felt that it warrants a
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
greater um support
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
or ratification by the legislative body
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
because that's you see what I'm saying
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
power good morning Mr ice chair and
 
00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.510 align:start position:0%
power good morning Mr ice chair and
committee

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
members uh for the record my name is
 
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
Eric power from Brookline representing
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
myself I also serve on the Brookline
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
planning board I'm going into my fifth
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
year starting in
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
2021 uh I'm supporting this bill because
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's an important bill I I talk
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
to um planning board members from the
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
rest of national Regional Planning
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
Commission at various meetings come up
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
with this problem we have in Brookline
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
where we have our this melandy Pond
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
Authority um where we have leases of
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
properties there's approximately 17
 
00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
properties that um are leased and each
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
year almost inevitably one of them comes
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
up um with leases expiring the intent is
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
to have leases that go about 13
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
years and it's almost a perennial at our
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
town meeting that we have to go and vote
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
to yep you get another five years and
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's almost an every every year we're
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
almost seeing this on our town warrant
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
and people are asking why can't we just
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
say we want to go to 13 years and vote
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
on that and let the people have that um
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
that certainty of you know not having to
 
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
worry about the lease not maybe not
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
getting renewed because people are
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
building houses you know houses on these
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
land leases and um
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
it comes back to the RSA
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
411a does not allow that and that's why
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
there's a purpose of this legislation
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
and in talking to others they found that
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
some are trying to do um things like
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
lease Town land for a mobile wireless
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
tower like a cell tower other ones want
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
to lease uh Town property for solar
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
arrays and they're limited by able to do
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
this in 5year renewable increments and
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
some projects just don't happen because
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
some uh some people that want a lease
 
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
want the certainty of more than 5 years
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
if they're going to make an investment
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
in standing up solar panels or going to
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
do something else they want and the
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
example that was brought up earlier was
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
about in Hampton where they wanted to be
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
able to you know use the land for
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
development they didn't want to invest
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
all this money in a development and then
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
have to worry in five years it might be
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
resented and all that investment goes
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
away so um it makes a lot of sense to
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
give the legislative body of the Town a
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
three-fifth ballot vote in order to
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
authorize these three fifths makes a lot
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
of sense because we do this on a lot of
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh warrant articles that have multi-year
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
impacts such as bonds such as you know
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
adopting sb2 such as a tax cap or a
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
budget cap so it makes sense for
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
something that endures for a long period
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
of time to have that super majority
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
agreement because it will impact the
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
town for many years um in the case of a
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
long lease of 99 years it certainly
 
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense to have the
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
Three-Fifths so um for those reasons I
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
would recommend the bill to be passed
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
recommended OTP out of committee I think
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
it'll do a lot of good across the state
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
for those that are trying to lease Town
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
property give them the mechanism and in
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation they need en
 
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
able to have these longer leases of town
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
property and I will take any questions
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr power any questions from Mr
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
power oh representative
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
grind thank you thank
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
and I probably should have asked it to
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative power maybe you can
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
answer this when and the part three
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're it's changing the three my
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
majority for a lease for up to five
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
years from just a majority so if there
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
are are current leases that are 5 years
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
and they're coming up for Renewal are
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
you now potentially requiring a three
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
fifths to pass and a lease that's
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
happened in the past will no longer pass
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
and become null and
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
void thank you for the question I'm
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
trying to dissect your question a little
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
bit um so if you've already given
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
authority to the town you've had this
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
you did this enabling
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that still stays in effect
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't if you don't have it
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
then you would have to uh pass this
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
Authority at the three-fifth level I
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
know that that appears to be a change um
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
from current law but I think it makes a
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
lot of sense when you're giving a
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
blanket Authority um I think that
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
requires a little bit higher level of uh
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
approval that's my personal opinion um
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
majority could I have a quick followup
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead um would it
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
potentially to because there's a grading
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
of one year five year and then over five
 
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
years would it make sense more to have
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
majority to pass at a fiveyear and then
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
the three fifths to pass if it's greater
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
than five
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
years thank you for the question I think
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision I would not be
 
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to that if that's something the
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee felt was a stronger um uh way
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
to go um I think three fifths I think
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
most people would agree for more than
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
five years makes sense for the up to
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
five years the blanket Authority I'm
 
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
kind of on the fence on that I kind of
 
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
think it's important I think it should
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
be a ballot vote instead of a simple
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
card vote but um that's something the
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee to decide I think that's an
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
area that could be
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
refined representative
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
question um I'm going back also to the
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
the 3- fifths majority being required um
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
I know we're talking about expenditures
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh in a lot of the examples uh that
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
you've given um municipalities are
 
00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
desperate for Revenue generating
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
projects uh to drive down the cost of
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes at this time
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
so the concern I think to piggyback on
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative grund is if you are in
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
a revenue generating lease on a a cell
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
tower site on a solar um site and you
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
are generating good Revenue through
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
Pilots or um payment in Le of
 
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.030 align:start position:0%
Pilots or um payment in Le of
taxes

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
then you have shifted to a 3- fifths
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
majority being
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
required outside of your five years that
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
you've already signed on if that were to
 
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.030 align:start position:0%
you've already signed on if that were to
fail

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
then then that's a huge loss of Revenue
 
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.510 align:start position:0%
then then that's a huge loss of Revenue
and

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
I what would you what what would be the
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
I mean you've signed a lease um with a
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
company for 30 years you've been
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
authorized to sign that lease for 30
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
years by the legislative body uh why now
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
go back I guess and then require a 3-
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
fifths on top of
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
that I think I understand your question
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about a lease that's
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
been renewed at 5-year intervals if if
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
the legislative body has given that
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
blanket Authority you already have the
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
blanket Authority um so the three-fifth
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
vote is a one-time vote for any lease
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
for up to five years so that would
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
continue as it would today um the the
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
the the Major Impact would be those who
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
have not voted to have a um given this
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
authorization at all to their town for
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
up to 5 years they would need to get
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
that onetime vote of 3 fifths I don't
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
think the 35th would be a difficult
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
thing to get especially if it's going to
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
help the town generate um Revenue
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
because that will help all taxpayers
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking um so I think that
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
would make sense I think it makes sense
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
for the long-term individual leases so
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
you got to remember this legislation is
 
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.349 align:start position:0%
you got to remember this legislation is
talking

00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
about a c three categories one is up to
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
a year which the Selectmen can do on
 
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.349 align:start position:0%
a year which the Selectmen can do on
their

00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
own they don't need the the voters they
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
can go up they can then they can get a
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
blanket Authority for any
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
lease if it if once the voter's give
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
that Authority they can do that for any
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
lease they can renew it for up to five
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
years they don't have to revote on that
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
and then the third category is the new
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
category which is leases over five years
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
you vote on those leases on an
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
individual basis on a specific basis for
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
that lease so if if you do a 30-year
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
lease you vote on it for 30 years and
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
that's a three- fifths vote those last
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
votes any other questions representative
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr Vice chair thank you
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
question how did you get the three-
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
fifths why not 2/3 that's still a super
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
majority thank you for the question um
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
the seems like the the precedent that's
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
been set in Municipal and School
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
District law has been for most things to
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
be a three-fifth majority today we used
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
to have um I think up to about five
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
years ago bonds at a traditional meeting
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
required a
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
two3 majority vote but that got changed
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
to three- fifths uh 2/3 is a very high
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
standard I think that that's uh
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
unusually high standard for things there
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
are a few laws out there that I'm aware
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
of that have the two-thirds but um even
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
in traditional towns passing a bond is
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
now at the three-fifth vote most other a
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
lot of enabling legislation there simple
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
majority or three-fifths so it made
 
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
sense to sort of stay with that
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
three-fifths if the committee felt 2/3
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
was more plausible you know I would not
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
be against that but I think that is a
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
pass any other
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
questions seeing that Mr power thank you
 
00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:24.510 align:start position:0%
questions seeing that Mr power thank you
very

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
desay morning Mr Des thank you Mr Vice
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you to the committee

for hearing my testimony today my name
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
is birie Dees I represent the Hampshire
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and um we are
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
currently opposed to House Bill 337 as
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
written um House Bill 33 373 sorry um
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 373 continues to allow a
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
select board to lease or rent land up to
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
one year without voter approval it also
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
expands the lease of rental duration the
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
legislative body May Pro May approve
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
without needing another vote by the by
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
the legislative body to not exceed 99
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
years instead of the existing 5 years
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
under RSA 41 11-a um it also changes the
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
threshold um for voter approval to a
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
35th super majority rather than the
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
existing majority to permit the select
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
board to enter into a rental or lease
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
agreements of up to 5 years without
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
getting further approval from the
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
legislative body annually um our
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
specific intention is with lines uh 22-
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
25 and lines
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
13-4 I'll read briefly lines 22 through
 
00:53:39.789 --> 00:53:39.799 align:start position:0%
2 quote the legislative body may vote by
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
a 3- fth super majority at an annual or
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
special meeting to Grant the select
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
board The Authority or resend such
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
Authority previously granted to rent or
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
lease any Municipal property under their
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
control for a term of up to 5 years um
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
the way we also read this bill is it
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
would require um votes by ballot at
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting um which hasn't
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
been the standard currently um it would
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
also override the existing votes by
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies in municipalities
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
that have approved um leases of up to 5
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
years um now require revote to be in
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
accordance with these statutes um
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's no language that says the leases
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
prior to this bill being enacted should
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
it become law would remain unchanged and
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
not impacted and that's one of our
 
00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:22.119 align:start position:0%
deepest concerns um this could also
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
raise some concerns with some
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities or those Leasing and
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
renting their land or property that this
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill could be construed as retroactive
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
and so for those reasons while we
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the expansion of um the local
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
control to permit uh municipalities with
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
approval from their legislative bodies
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
to enter into agreements of up to 99
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
years with still the legislative body's
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
ability to resend those agreements um
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
the 3- fth super majority would be a
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
change in the possibilities of this
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
being construed as retroactive or
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
requiring um new votes or that would
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
need three-fifths um voter approval to
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
enter into lease agreement um would be
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
something municipalities would have to
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
deal with and could negatively impact uh
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
their uh efficiency and Effectiveness in
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
governing um locally and with that I
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
will take any questions thank
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Des any questions for
 
00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.069 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Des any questions for
Mr

00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
Des represent
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question be uh kind of
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
inartfully worded question but the gist
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
is is there a state kind of trip wire
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
where 2/3 becomes three fifths and is
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
happens I'm wondering if you could
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
rephrase your question I think I
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you're asking but I want
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure I ask it correctly sorry
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
answer correctly most voting is simple
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
majority in some cases it's a super
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
majority is there any kind of Statewide
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
not law but kind
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
of guard rail that says a
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
vote a matter of this importance
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
requires a super majority are there any
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
categories of
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
decisions that legislative bodies make
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
that require three-fifths decision as
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to a simple majority what I'm
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is what's the rationale
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
for moving a simple majority to a super
 
00:56:25.039 --> 00:56:27.589 align:start position:0%
for moving a simple majority to a super
majority

00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
um so I can speak to my understanding I
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the rationale of um why
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
legislators have changed the laws
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
previously from majority to uh super
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
majorities but my understanding is that
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
when it's long-term agreements
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
especially those that involve taking on
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
debt so like a bond there's a belief
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
that you need a super majority of the
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
voters who tend to be the taxpayers to
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
agree to take on that whether it's a
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
15-year Bond or a 30-year Bond because
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
they will be paying off that debt for a
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
long duration of time um so it's tended
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
to be the legislature's prerogative to
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
um require the legislative bodies and
 
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have a three- fths
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
majority to pass on long-term agreements
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
um especially those where the
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipality will be taking on
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
burden any other
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%

413 I appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
present this bill to you for your

consideration for the record I am
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%

36 house bill 14 43 was filed upon the

house bill to
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
12:15 this bill passed the house on
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
consent calendar unfortunately when this
 
00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
that bill went to the other chamber not
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
one but two non-gain amendments were
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
amended onto the bill and the committee
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
of conference report failed in the
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
house in general this bill provides
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility to developers enabling large
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
projects to be undertaken and completed
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
over a number of years with with lower
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
risk thereby providing our state with
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
the much needed
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
housing that is needed the bill does
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
this in three important ways first the
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
bill extends the existing fiveyear
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
exemption for subdivision plats um an
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
additional two years to seven years for
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
completion and it also increases the
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary step to get the project
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
actively and substan substantially
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
underway from 2 years to 3 years
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
secondly the bill changes the building
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
code and fire code appeals process
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
limiting the jurisdiction of the local
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
building board of appeals to hearing
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
decisions made under local amendments to
 
01:00:40.839 --> 01:00:41.630 align:start position:0%
decisions made under local amendments to
those

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
codes importantly this provides relief
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
for appeals by a developer from having
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
to have to first appeal to the local
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board of adjustment or the board
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen when they are acting as the
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
local building code board of appeals for
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
State Building Code or state fire code
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
disputes instead the developer can
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
directly appeal to the State Building
 
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
Code review board which will speed up
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
the the process overall thirdly the bill
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
provides that approved subdivision plats
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
site plans and building permits shall be
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
required to meet all the State Building
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
Code fire code and Municipal zoning
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances in existence and in full
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
effect at the time the development plans
 
01:01:34.039 --> 01:01:35.510 align:start position:0%
effect at the time the development plans
were

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
approved importantly the Subdivision
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
plat will be exempt from any subsequent
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
changes in the codes or regulations made
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
after the approval for the
 
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
project um when when the approval for
 
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
the project was granted by the
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
municipality for up to seven years so
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
long as that project is actively and
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
substantially underway within the
 
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
three-year time period so why is this
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
important well that provision prevents
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
escalating costs as a result of the
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
developer needing to have to go back and
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
redo work after a project had been
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
approved to certain building codes and
 
01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.309 align:start position:0%
approved to certain building codes and
um

01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
regulations that were in time that were
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
in place at the time that the project
 
01:02:26.559 --> 01:02:29.069 align:start position:0%
in place at the time that the project
was

01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
approved in in order to meet the the
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
newly adopted codes and regulations and
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
again this is
 
01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
important for large scale projects
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
because it reduces risk to the to the
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
developer and it encourages them to be
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
able to take on larger projects that
 
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
take more time to complete
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
without incurring additional costs
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that impedes getting the housing out
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
that that we need to solve the housing
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
crisis so to explain that because I
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
think it might that that provision might
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
have been a little bit confusing so the
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
problem that is occurring is that in
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
some municipalities they're withholding
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
the certificates of occupancy when the
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
development project takes longer than
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
five years after that project had been
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
approved by the planning board
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
I the prime sponsor of the the previous
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
bill and I also agree that it's
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
preferable for the subdivision approval
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
extended to seven years under the
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
original terms which would be under the
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
original fire codes State building codes
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
and ordinances and any other
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
requirements that were in existence when
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
that plan was the development plan plan
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
was approved so the bill also corrects
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
an oversight in RSA 673 colon 3 that
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
some for some reason it's stated that
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
only an elected zoning board could be
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
could serve as the local building code
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
board of appeals so I corrected that
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
error under in the language of this bill
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
in front of you so that either an
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
elected or an appointed zoning Board of
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
adjustment may act as the local building
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
code board board of
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
appeals and
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
um finally I have compiled a side by
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
side um document comparing because
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of parts and pieces to
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
this and it looks overwhelming but when
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's laid out it it's very it's simple
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
and and it's clear so in order to
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
communicate that to you I prepared the
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
side-by-side document comparing the
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
current law House Bill
 
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
413 and you'll see um I have it
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
highlighted hopefully it's a gray
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
highlight for you the the changes and
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
that text is in bold and also comments
 
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
explaining exactly what the amended
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
language does to conclude I um I urge
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to recommend house bill
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
for 13 ought to pass to help streamline
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
the building process and to enable
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
developers to be able to build more of
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
the housing that the granite state needs
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that concludes my
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill introduction and happy to take
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
power representative Frank thank you Mr
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
Vice chair um Vice
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative power in your
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
research over the last say 10 years how
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
much of a problem has it been for
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
developers to exceed the current time
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
frame thank you for the question
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
representative so as I explained that
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
this bill I haven't been a state rep for
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
10 years but I I can certainly
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
research so as I explained that this
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
bill was filed at the request of the
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of TW the a bill last year
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
which was 1215 so I am the that
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
individual um is not a state rep this
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
this this term so he asked me to file
 
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.870 align:start position:0%
this this term so he asked me to file
this

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
bill and so I
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
guess in his research in filing the bill
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
last year apparently he he saw that
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
there was a need for this additionally
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
this um goes along with the governor's
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
plan to streamline um building and the
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
development process and to enable
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
developers to be able to build the much
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
needed housing that need here in the
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
state I hope that answers your question
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
um it does and if you or perhaps the
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
former representative could provide some
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you any other
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
questions rep stavis thank you Mr Vice
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking what I
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
think will be a
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering why you think an
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
extension is needed given certain sets
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
of examples that I could give from
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
Lebanon where where development is
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
proceeding a pace on many many different
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
fronts with literally several hundred
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
units of housing coming online within
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the 2-year framework uh the only two
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
developments in my 8year on the Lebanon
 
01:07:59.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
planning board that that had to be given
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
extensions extensions after extensions
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
where a not housing developments and B
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
one of them is going into year 16
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
now uh at Great Peril to the city at
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
great financial burden to the
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and I just think that
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
if so many developers can get so much
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
work done in the a lotted I under
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
current law why do you think this is
 
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
needed now when so many of them are
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
getting it done thank you for the
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
question representative well I um
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
applaud the developers that are able to
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
to get things um to get their
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
projects underway and going and and
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
completed I would say that as we all
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
know that the housing be it houses
 
01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.430 align:start position:0%
know that the housing be it houses
Apartments

01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
Apartments
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
Etc we don't have enough we don't have
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
enough here in the state and
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
um so what I would say let me just make
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
this comment so with regards to um
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
changing it from you know 5 to 7 um to
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
be clear the the the bill 2015 changed
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
it for five from 5 to 10 and I thought
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
that that was too much so I dialed it
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
back on on
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
with my own discretion to seven so to to
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
to further answer your question my
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there is still
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
today supply chain issues with regards
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
to building accessing building materials
 
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
that that is my understanding we that
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
that was an issue clearly that
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
manifested during covid I am personally
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
not a builder or a developer but that is
 
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding as to why this this
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
comment I don't I don't it was one more
 
01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.270 align:start position:0%
comment I don't I don't it was one more
comment

01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
um oh the other thing is
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
um again I'm not a builder or developer
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
but based on what what my understanding
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
is is with regards to our work our
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce we we don't have enough
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
workers to do the work that we need uh
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
um so I feel that that possibly also
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
factors into this the need for this bill
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
so that all being said if people feel
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
that some of these timelines need to be
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
amendments any other questions
 
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.950 align:start position:0%
amendments any other questions
representative

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
Kobe thank you chair and thank you for
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I noticed that
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking a lot about housing
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't see specifically and and I
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't have uh extensive planning board
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
experience like some of my colleagues
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
here I don't see that this is limited to
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
residential um
 
01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions thank you for the question
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative that would be uh well see
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this would
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
pertain to all types of development
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
because planning boards um in
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities deal with commercial
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
residential so it would be
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
all so um followup if I may followup so
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
then we could potentially be looking at
 
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.750 align:start position:0%
then we could potentially be looking at
a

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
a
10year

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
10year
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
project um anywhere within a
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
municipality whether it be uh commercial
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
or residentially
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
zoned it depends on the the size and the
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
scope of the development project thank
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
you okay uh any other
 
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions see n thank representative
 
01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.550 align:start position:0%

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
please good morning again Mr
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
power good morning committee members Mr
 
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
Vice chair uh for the record I'm Eric
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
power from Brookline representing myself
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill and uh current
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
planning serving on the planning board
 
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.149 align:start position:0%
planning serving on the planning board
since

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
2021 and um I think this is an important
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill um because I think right now we
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
have some timelines that are uh pretty
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
aggressive for some uh developments
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
especially housing developments
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
and the um what happens is that
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes if they take too long they
 
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
don't complete the development in five
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
years then they've got to go back and
 
01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:08.669 align:start position:0%
years then they've got to go back and
get

01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
reapprovals amendments over the past
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
five years and that can be a very
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
expensive process one of the things that
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
happened recently um was the uh was the
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic we had supply chain we had
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
workers we had a lot of shutdowns so um
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of the um subdivision plats that
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
were approved in the 2020 2021 they
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
languished and um they needed they're
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
running up against the five-year um time
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
clock that's currently in
 
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
law when developers take on projects
 
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
they they aren't looking for delays
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing the projects to make money
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
so they're always trying to make things
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
happen as fast as they can because
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's the goal and so they're not
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally going to
 
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
um slow down a
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
project however um there sometimes are
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances beyond their control
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
things that come up with maybe surprises
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
during the development and those have to
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
be dealt with and that does cause delays
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you got to consider
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
is sometimes a developer is looking at
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
they look at these timelines and they
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
make a a decision how big a project do I
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
want to take on I know I have to finish
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
I have to get it substantially underway
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
in two years and I have to complete
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
complet it in five wow I might not want
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
to do as big a project because you know
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's a big risk there that I'm going
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
have to be 80% done and I'm going to
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
have to come back to the planning board
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
and go through this whole approval
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
process again and they don't want to do
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
that so they may shy away from the
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
larger projects which is obviously not
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
something that we want in New Hampshire
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
right now especially from the housing
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
perspective so giving them that
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility of the extra two years um to
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
give them seven years to complete the
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
project and give them three years to get
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
substantial um substantial development
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh active and substantial development
 
01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
underway makes a lot of sense the other
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
thing that we're doing in Brookline is
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we're we are growing like many
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
towns are and we had a growth management
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
ordinance for a while and the planning
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
board every year if you're not sure what
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
a growth management ordinance is it it
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
allows you to limit how many building
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
permits you have a year we had that in
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
place and this year we had made a
 
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
calculation say you know this this
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
growth of management ordinance is good
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
but it's a little heavy-handed it was
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
limiting the number of building permits
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
to about you know 15 in our town for the
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
whole year and we said well that doesn't
 
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
make sense but we didn't want to open up
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
the floodgates completely so we ended up
 
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
um develop adopting something that was
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
allowed under land use law we've
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
proposed it it's on our ballot uh next
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
week to adopt phase development where we
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
can phase things for up to five
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
years and um I hope the voters approve
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
it it's been had had positive public
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
hearing but you can see where this is
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
going so now we have a phase development
 
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be probably adopting
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
in our
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
town and so they're going to have to hit
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
the hit their numbers almost exactly
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have this
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
five-year phase development which is
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
what's allowed under law and now they
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
only have five years to complete it so
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
the intent is to phase the development
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
because we have some school capacity
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
challenges and we want to be able to
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
manage that and and and grow the schools
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
and not be
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
overcrowded um and also for municipal
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
Services as well so by by allowing the
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
seven years that makes things work a lot
 
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
better and um it allows us as as a
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
planning board to have this phase
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
development work as well this is a
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
something that's happening across the
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
state um summer doing the phase
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
development some are not but I think
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
having when you when you're allowed to
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
do a phase development for five years it
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
makes sense to give seven years to
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
complete a project because because life
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
happens during these
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
projects um I also think the correction
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
of the Zoning Board of adjustment
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
requiring it now to be your building
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
cold board of appeals that has to be an
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
elected doesn't make sense a lot of um
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
towns have an appointed zoning Board of
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
adjustments so they should be able to
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
act in that that case and I also think
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
the changes about the whole appeals
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
process makes a lot of sense we don't
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
need our local Zoning Board of
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment hearing an appeal on a fire
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
marshal code that is set by the state or
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
State Building Code set by the state not
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
locally changed but set by the state it
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense for that to be heard by the
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
state at the state level um and do that
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
more expediently and that will also
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
speed things up and so for those reasons
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
I would recommend passage of HB 4113 I
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
hope you recommended OTP out of
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr power how about
 
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um is it your
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that a de developer has to
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
com completely go through the review
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
process of the planning board again to
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
be granted a two-year extension
 
01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go thank you for the
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
question they don't have to go through
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
that the planning board can do that but
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's always the risk that uh
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
depending on who's on the planning board
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
and what's going on they have no
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
guarantees and this would give them a
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee followup Mr yeah go ahead
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
followup but currently under law that is
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
not a requirement full planning Board
 
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
review for a two-year extension that is
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
not that is correct thank you any other
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions representive
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
awood thank you Mr Vice chairman and
 
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr power for taking my
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%

eight um regarding 155 d a colon
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
11-b the amended language Roman
 
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
1 the board shall hear and decide
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
appeals of order ERS decisions or
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
determinations made by the local
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
building official shouldn't it say
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
building code
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
official I building official
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
does thank you for the question I would
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's correct or not
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm it might be correct or you might
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
need to have the word code in there have
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
to look and see how it's referenced in
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
the RSA but would be a minor fix if it
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
need needed to be there we want to have
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
it correct obviously so thank you for
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
bringing that up thank
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr power
 
01:20:09.199 --> 01:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr power
thank

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
please good morning again Mr
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
desas thank you Mr Vice chairman uh for
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
the record my name is bro Dees I
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
Association and we are currently opposed
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
413 as um as it's as it's written um the
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
proposed vesting periods to my
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
understanding were negotiated by my
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
predecessor and the New Hampshire
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
planners Association agreeing Upon A
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
seven-year vesting period with a
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
three-year extension the three-year
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
extension being if uh granted by the
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
planning board we do want to raise some
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
concerns with page two lines 18- 22 um
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
this would essentially bypass the local
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
building code board of appeals either a
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
zoning Board of adjustments or the board
 
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen for almost every single
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
building code appeal under RSA 674 colon
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
34 um the vast majority of
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't substantively amend
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
their local building code so rarely
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
would they ever hear an appeals
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
additionally it can be more practical um
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
to the property owner Builder code
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer Andor fire chief to
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
attend a buildin code appeals hearing in
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
their municipality versus going to
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
conquered for a hearing um limiting to
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
limiting to only local appeals on local
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code cuts out
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
key sto stakeholders including the
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
municipality and doesn't necessarily
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
make the process easier arguably it may
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
slow down the process and could do so
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
substantively for developers having to
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
wait you know I'm unsure how often the
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
um the State Building Code appeals board
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
the State Building board meets but um
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
you'd be on their timetable rather than
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
the municipality maybe getting on their
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
horse and trying to schedule something
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
as soon as reasonably possible again we
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
aren't opposed to increasing the vesting
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
period to uh to 7 over three years or
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
increasing the extension period from 24
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
months to 3 years but making that
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
requirement retroactive to July 1st 2023
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
invites unanswerable questions on
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
entitlement to statutory vesting for
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
example what if a me so specifically
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
this is page two lines 13- 14 um this
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
retroactive imposing of the change of
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
vesting and some questions we might ask
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
would be what if a municipality has
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
already ruled a project lost its vesting
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
and legal cases closed does this now
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
allow reopening of the case there's some
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and uncertainty there um does
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
this violate the State Constitution
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
which prevents retroactive laws could a
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
municipality have standing if this law
 
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts their residents or
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
the town's government um we do want to
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
flag too that when uh these um these
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
vesting periods were previous previously
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
changed last done in 2011 uh SB 144 um
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
they made similar changes but did not
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
make them
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
retroactively so um we would we would
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
kindly ask that the um the committee at
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
at bare minimum consider um not making
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
these vesting period changes
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
retroactive um and with that I thank you
 
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony this morning and
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
Kobe thank you Vice chair thank you for
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
um what are some of the costs whether
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
they be monetary or
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
um you know other uh that are born by
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh associated with
 
01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh associated with
lengthy

01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
development are you talking about like
 
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh like traffic or um Road damages or
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
improvements or other projects like what
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
are some of the the costs associated
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
with lengthy
 
01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
development if you're talking about
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
long-term phase developments I mean
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lot of cost yeah as
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
as I mean any kind of higher density
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
housing developments that are going to
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
be established in municipality there's
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
going to be there's going to be cost to
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
to infrastructure whether it's water and
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
sewer there's going to be cost to the
 
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
environment possibly because of the
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
increase of waste disposal and limiting
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of land that's um that's been
 
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
preserved you know for for natural use
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
um you're going to see um you know more
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
wear and tear on your roads you're going
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
to need more plows possibly more police
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
and fire to meet those needs depending
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
on the size of development you might
 
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
need to hire you know hire more
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal staff and more Public Safety
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
staff I mean all all development because
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
populations increase and because it's
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
the nature of the Beast is going to
 
01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
require more tax money more revenues and
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
more of those revenues to be allocated
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
to dealing with higher populations in
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
larger municipalities I mean it's like
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
the difference between you know I know
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
enfield's a smaller town representative
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
Frack than wolfboro so it's like the
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
difference between what Enfield might
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
need versus if it grew up to the size of
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
wolfboro versus if wolf bro became the
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
size of Manchester right the amount of
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
resources and the amount of um
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you need to support that
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
type of development or those types of
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities they vary greatly and
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're very dictated by population and
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
population is dictated by the housing
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
Supply and how much housing you might
 
01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
acre repr maor thank you Mr Vice
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm wrapping up 12 years on
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
the planning board so hopefully these
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
issues will be behind me a little bit
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
but in those 12 years we've approved a
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
lot of plans that have been contentious
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we we weigh the value of a Butter's
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
rights very heavily in every case that
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have by extending the period to 73 or
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be do you consider
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
there to be an extended imposition on a
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
Butters which is not being considered in
 
01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.510 align:start position:0%
Butters which is not being considered in
this

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
bill I think in some respects yes and
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
obviously over a 7-year period
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities can change greatly and um
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
the circumstances or the traffic
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
patterns of that property where the
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
development's planned it can also change
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
greatly and so you know uh I think the
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill is to try to balance
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
the needs of developers to have some
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
stability in the process um as they're
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
trying to get financing and as they're
 
01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get their development going
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
with the needs for municipalities and
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately those they represent such as
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
a Butters to be able to um to require
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
them to go back through the planning
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
process should they um should they go
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
past the seven-year period as proposed
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
so um I mean I do hear the concerns and
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
um there are concerns that we share at
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%

favor of this bill also uh serving on
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
the brooklane planning board since
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
2021 um this this bill is about um
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the alternative procedure for
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
the adoption of ordinances that was a
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
real that was originally uh in house in
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 538 last year which was
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
voted itl by the house in a roll call
 
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
then that language was added as an
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
1400 uh which ultimately became law um
 
01:31:36.189 --> 01:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
what this procedure does it allows that
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the town can vote to let the
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
select board be the ones that propose
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
and approve zoning amendments in the
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
town by a simple majority vote at a
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
meeting after a single public hearing um
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are many problems created by this
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
law and House Bill 229 resends this um
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
this resends this procedure for many
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
reasons um
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
first this new law strips away a key
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility from local planning
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
boards that is proposing zoning
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
amendments it takes away the zoning
 
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
proposal Authority and responsibility
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
from the planning board and gives it to
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
the select board and it eliminates one
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
of the main functions of the planning
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
board it's the planning board that has
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
the knowledge training and expertise in
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
crafting and listening to our Town's
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
voters to develop zoning amendments in
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
accordance with with our master plan
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
zoning changes need to be made in a
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
careful deliberate manner with public
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
input and often multiple public hearings
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
after that input to not create
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and create
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts in zoning ordinances the
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
select board has many other
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and typically lacks the
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
necessary background in zoning and and
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
in the time to properly carry out this
 
01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.990 align:start position:0%
in the time to properly carry out this
important

01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility number two it
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
disenfranchises Town voters who no
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
longer vote on zoning amendments if you
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
have this alternative procedure it's the
 
01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
select board deciding on the zoning
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
amendments they propose them and they
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
they vote on them the voters do not have
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
a say except for maybe a plea at a
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing this takes away A Long
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
established process of final approval of
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
zoning amendments on Election Day on
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
official ballot by voters and will
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
likely cause voter disenfranchisement
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
and resentment number three it further
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
concentrates power power and authority
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
in select
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
boards right now the zoning proposal
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
Authority resides with the planning
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
board or by citizens by citizens
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
petition while the approval is all the
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
town's voters by official ballot this
 
01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
new law 6741 18a gives the Z select
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
board zoning Amendment exclusive
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
proposal and and approval Authority in
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
note this was proposed to help the
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
housing crisis but that this author is
 
01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
not limited to residential zoning
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
amendments but applies as zoning
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
amendments for commercial and Industrial
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
zones as well and if you think about it
 
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
in a in a town with a five-person select
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
board three members can propose and
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
approve zoning amendments in towns with
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
just three Selectmen you can have two
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
members that entirely propose and
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
approve zoning amendments for the entire
 
01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
town most would believe this is a undo
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
and unhealthy concentration of P of
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
zoning power in just a few
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
individuals and number four
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
this this law has created numerous
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
conflicts and ambiguities in lanu
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
statute um the bill talks about
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
redefining the the the the law redefines
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
the governing
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
body as the legislated body for the
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of zoning amendments but it
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
fails to make adjustments in many other
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
areas of land use statute and I have
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
them in the hand out I'll just highlight
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of them in RSA
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
3753 it talks about the method of
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
enactment of zoning amendments there's a
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know statement there saying it'll be
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
amendments are upon the affirmative vote
 
01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:02.679 align:start position:0%
of the ballot of the majority of legal
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
voters there's a conflict because only
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
the selectman vote on approving
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
amendments is not voted at the town
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
meeting um paragraph four of that RSA
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
talks about you know having if there's a
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing and there's substanti of
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
changes made by made by the uh planning
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
board after that hearing they will hold
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
another hearing ing that doesn't apply
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
to the select board they can do one
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
hearing and and they don't require to
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
have a second one if changes were made
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
so that is a problem number uh RSA 6754
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
is about zoning petition warn articles
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
by citizens how are those handled if you
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
adopt this legislation um it says that
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
25 or more voters can petition a zoning
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance and that petition amendments
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
can only be voted on at the annual or V
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
Village district meeting via the
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
official ballot so what happens there
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict with the alternative
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
zoning procedure that only Selectmen can
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
propose amendments not citizens and
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
these are not voted on upon a town
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
meeting and then RSA 6755 is about
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
zoning protest zoning ordinance protest
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
petitions when when citizens can uh get
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
together and protest a zoning amendment
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
that has to be done at the annual
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
meeting seven days ahead and it requires
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
a 2/3 this is an example of a 2/3 vote
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
2third of the me members of the
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
legislative body shall vote to resend or
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
change via a a zoning protest petition
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
well with this new law does that mean
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
that the legislative body now being the
 
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
Selectmen is it just two-thirds of the
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and do they do that at the
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
town meeting very unclear so you can see
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
these conflicts in statute if if this if
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
this enabl uh this enabling legislation
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
is adopted would create some legal
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
problems and lastly the legislation so
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
called enabling legislation is enabling
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that can't be rescinded
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's only a provision to adopt this
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislation so once you adopt it there's
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
no way to resend it and I don't think
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing every every enabling
 
01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
legis almost every leg enabling
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
legislation in the state has a provision
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
for resending um a once adopted for
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
example if you adopt sb2 you can resend
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
it if you adopt a local tax cap you can
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
resend it this has no resend mechanism
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
so once you voted put it in you've got
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
it forever that's not a good thing so
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I think that this this
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
this this new law needs to be repealed
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
and I would recommend a to pass on House
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 229 and I'll take any questions
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for the
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
speaker representative majori is
 
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
question um last year I was one of a
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
number of people in the house uh who's a
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
selectman who serves on a planning board
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
jumping up and down that passing uh 1400
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
and 538 with this in it was an
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely horrible idea horrible idea
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
even as a member I don't want the
 
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do this and a lot of
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
people feel the same a lot of of my
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues felt the same way but the
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor isn't here to introduce this
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%

don't know what the right word is but a
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
lot of times we itl the bill so here's
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
my question do you believe this language
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
could be amended it onto another bill so
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
that we could pass it and it would be
 
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.790 align:start position:0%
that we could pass it and it would be
then

01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%

things that folks have said and if we
 
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
could limit your testimony to uh 3
 
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you uh go ahead
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and honorable committee members
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
as the prime sponsor I appreciate the
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce to you today
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 372 local for the record I am
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
representative Diane power I represent
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
the towns of Brooklyn Mason and
 
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
Greenville in Hillsboro County District
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
36 this bill is a refiling of 2024 House
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 1187 which passed the house on the
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
consent calendar with a unanimous
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation of ought to
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment the bill then passed
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
the other body and unfortunately was a
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor and subsequently
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
it failed a veto override in
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
October um I believe it was veto due to
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
a misunder understanding of the
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
legislation this is a simple
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill that was filed due
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
to the widespread misuse of the statute
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%

01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%

01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
projects is being used as a financing
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
approach because such proposals
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
currently qualify under RSA 33 7-e
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
enabling easier approval of the lease by
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
a simple majority vote at an annual
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
meeting in addition such leases under
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
the statute are not classified as
 
01:44:22.109 --> 01:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
long-term debt to qualify under this
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
statute a least with an escape Clause is
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
required which typically has an interest
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
rate of 1 to 2% higher than a comparable
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
Bond making it much more expensive than
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
Bond financing the problem addressed by
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is the closing of a loophole
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
in current law that allows for the lease
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
of items that once installed become
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
fixtures such as building materials like
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
framing Drive wall insulation flooring
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
doors windows electrical lighting HVAC
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
Etc under a lease agreement with an
 
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
escape clause and this presumes that
 
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
these items once installed can be
 
01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
returned so I would ask you to ask
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
yourself how can something that's fixed
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
and installed a fixed and installed
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
equipment and building materials
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
returned once it's
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
installed in my opinion and the opinion
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
of others this is a clear misuse of the
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
lease agreements of equipment statute
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
moreover based on my ongoing research
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
and reports from State reps across the
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
state and citizens as well I have now
 
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
found 24 examples to date of school
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
districts and towns misusing the lease
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment statute and I've
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
provided those examples to you in this
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
handout for your reference so I'll point
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
out a a couple of examples in 2022 the
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
Brookline district school district put
 
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
forth a warrant article for an 18-year
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
lease agreement with an escape Clause
 
01:46:14.189 --> 01:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
totaling $2.5 million for energy
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
conservation equipment an elevator
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.390 align:start position:0%

01:46:24.189 --> 01:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
Renovations and in 2024 for the Thornton
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
School District put forward a warrant
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
article for a 20-year lease agreement
 
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
with an escape clause for a total Boiler
 
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.149 align:start position:0%
with an escape clause for a total Boiler
Room

01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
Room
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
replacement costing $4.4 million the
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
most egregious misuse of this lease
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment statute was in
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
2023 in which the Timberlane Regional
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
School District placed a an a war an
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
article on the warrant to fund a 20year
 
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
lease agreement totaling
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
$25.2 million for facilities repairs and
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance at multiple schools it's
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
been estimated that the lease in this
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
particular case will end up costing the
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers more than $6 million more in
 
01:47:16.750 --> 01:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
interest payments than if a bond had
 
01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.990 align:start position:0%
interest payments than if a bond had
been

01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
used so again stop and ask yourself how
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
is a lease agreement with an escape
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
Clause practical in any of these cases
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
and also how could you even escape a
 
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
least renovation taxpayers should not
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
have to pay a premium lease interest
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
rate for a lease within Escape Clause
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
that can't be practically exercised so
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
the solution is House Bill
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
372 which ends the misuse of this
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
statute lease agreements of equipment
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
with Escape clauses it closes the loose
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
loophole that's being inappropriately
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
used to fund major facilities
 
01:48:02.589 --> 01:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
improvements and Renovations around the
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
lease of
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
equipment and it also prevents items or
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
equipment that become fixed items or
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
fixtures to be financed through lease
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment under the
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
statute to be clear House Bill 372 still
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
allows for any lease agreement of
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
equipment to be proposed and adopted but
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
it does not allow for the lease
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
agreement of equipment that contains
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
items that once installed become
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
fixtures under RSA 33 col 7-e so items
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
that are not fixtures like vehicles and
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
wheeled items are still supported by
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
this statute under this
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill and I need to address one important
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
thing and that is to point out that you
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
will hear other people testify and claim
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
that certain types of projects such as
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
energy improvements and Renewables will
 
01:49:06.629 --> 01:49:06.639 align:start position:0%
be negatively impact impacted or even
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
prohibited by this bill and this simply
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
is not true to be clear under house bill
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
372 these projects in fact can still be
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
proposed and financed by a bond or lease
 
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
agreement under our RSA 32 and
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
33 this includes energy performance
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
contracts which fall under RSA
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
21i colon
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
19d importantly because these types of
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
lease agreements will no longer qualify
 
01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.030 align:start position:0%
lease agreements will no longer qualify
under

01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
337e due to containing equipment that
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
become fixtures these lease agreements
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
now need to be approved by a 35th
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
majority vote and if they're approved it
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
will be considered long term
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
debt after all these leases are really
 
01:49:59.709 --> 01:49:59.719 align:start position:0%
long-term commitments with no practical
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
or economical means by which to escape
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
and return
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
fixtures House Bill 372 will encourage
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
School boards and select boards to use
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
the most coste effective method um
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
financing method um to finance projects
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the taxpayers which will
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly in most cases
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
it it's bonds and leases without these
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
expensive Escape Clauses so for these
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
reasons I ask that the committee
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass on House Bill
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
372 local to bring an end to the misuse
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
of lease agreements of equipment statute
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'm happy to
 
01:50:46.199 --> 01:50:47.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'm happy to
take

01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative power
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
uh any questions to the
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
kobby thank you Vice chair thank you for
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I noticed there's
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
no description for the term
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
fixtures um in many municipalities and
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
school districts uh we would lease um
 
01:51:14.589 --> 01:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
things like software um or network
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
upgrades uh we would lease security
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
cameras security
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
thing to me that becomes a fixture of
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
the building so how are we separating
 
01:51:31.239 --> 01:51:32.430 align:start position:0%
the building so how are we separating
the

01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
project thank you for the question
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative to be clear like I said
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
this is a refiling of a bill from last
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
um last legislative session and the bill
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
as introduced was huge it was very much
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
different and I worked very closely with
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
Association um we went through many
 
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
reiterations of this bill to arrive at
 
01:51:59.310 --> 01:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
the language that is in front of you and
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding so obviously I work
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
very closely with the financial
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
um person at nhma as well as the
 
01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:09.950 align:start position:0%
um person at nhma as well as the
municipal

01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
attorney to um distill the language to
 
01:52:16.069 --> 01:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
what we have and my understanding is
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
that fixture is a well-defined term
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
legally so um to expound and
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
so to expound on that a fixture is
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
something that once installed is is
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
permanent and becomes part of the
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
building the
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
plant things that items that are
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
equipment is something that is a
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
standalone if you will like this statute
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
337e lease agreements of
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
equipment the purpose of the legislative
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
intent of that of that statute is for
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
leases with Escape closet for items that
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
are return that can be returned for
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
example like a fire trck an ambulance a
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
piece of heavy equipment maybe a copier
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh or even possibly a generator that
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
sits outside on a pad those are things
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
that can easily be returned and as I
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
described in my bill
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
introduction and if you refer to this
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
handout you'll see descriptions of
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
projects that are being proposed that go
 
01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.229 align:start position:0%
projects that are being proposed that go
well

01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
beyond uh the definition of equipment as
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
I said we're talking about flooring
 
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
drywall Windows
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
Etc an
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
elevator you going to rip out the
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
elevator and return it that just doesn't
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
make sense so I hope that helps to
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
question repr kobby uh just a quick
 
01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
question repr kobby uh just a quick
followup

01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
so if I have a police department that
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
leases their cameras and their security
 
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
equipment and maybe the servers that go
 
01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
along with those I've built a special
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
room for that
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
server I have done special wiring uh and
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
electrical um that may or may not be a
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
agreement uh do do I have to separate
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
those two items now if this legislation
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
were to pass would I have to in other
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
words pay a separate
 
01:54:33.149 --> 01:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
electrician um and and hire uh separate
 
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
entities and then have the equipment
 
01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:37.430 align:start position:0%
entities and then have the equipment
installed

01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
installed
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
by the company that was leasing to me
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
that that would be correct
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
because I hope that people can
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
understand that the statute is being
 
01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
abused so to go back to my example of a
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
generator that's a piece of equipment
 
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
and the statute as written you could you
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
could roll in the cabling maybe the
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
concrete for the pad I mean that's
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's fine but we're talking about
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar projects that that
 
01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
are being
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
um funded through this statute and
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's just that that's gone Way Beyond
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
as as I said that the statute the
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of the statute is
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
being misused used and it's incumbent
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
upon the legislature to recognize that
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers any other
 
01:55:37.629 --> 01:55:37.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
you our next speaker will be Natasha
 
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:56.109 align:start position:0%
you our next speaker will be Natasha
Shaw

01:55:56.109 --> 01:55:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
ma'am good morning hope everyone's doing
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
well um thank you madam chair and The
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
Honorable members of this committee uh
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
my name is Natasha Shaw and I'm opposing
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
this house bill 372 on behalf of the
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
National Association of energy service
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
companies um we're also called Nasco so
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
Nasco is a leading trade Association for
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
industry Energy Services IND indry and
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
our concerted efforts have been
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the advocacy promotion for
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
Energy savings performance contracts um
 
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
our industry has successfully executed
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
over 7 billion annually so I'm a little
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
bit surprised um uh by the comments by
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor um we've been doing these
 
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
projects nationally through lease
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
agreements um it's a very well-respected
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
program there were some comments made
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
about uh misuse and Escape clauses is I
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that uh you know
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
the common law in New Hampshire
 
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
overwrites the needs for the scape
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
Clause um the bill significantly
 
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
restricts our customers Cy City Schools
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
from implementing infrastructure and
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
building improvements through these tax
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
exempt lease agreements and this
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
financing V vehicle does not require any
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars this bill is frankly
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
catastrophic and terrible for our local
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
related businesses and unworkable for
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
many of our communities the true
 
01:57:24.069 --> 01:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
intended consequence of this bill is
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
that it prevents local government from
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
addressing deferred maintenance and
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
critical Capital infrastructure needs
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
through lease agreements resulting in
 
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
the need to then spend money on costly
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
new construction lease Agreements are
 
01:57:38.669 --> 01:57:38.679 align:start position:0%
one tool in the toolbox for
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities and this legislation
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
would further limit local government's
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
ability to properly maintain and sustain
 
01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:45.629 align:start position:0%
ability to properly maintain and sustain
their

01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure similar legislation as
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the sponsor was filed last
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
year and was ultimately vetoed by
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
governor sonunu in his veto message he
 
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
stated the offered legislation would
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
without exception undercut
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities opportunity to explore
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
such agreements in search of
 
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
advantageous timing and financing terms
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities have ever evolving needs
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
from school boilers to Energy Efficiency
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
projects that must be secured more
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
frequently than bonding opportunities
 
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
permit these decisions must still go
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
through multiple layers of approval
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
offering the opportunity for public
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
input and as such this B bill would
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily tie the hands of our local
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
communities I want to point out that we

tremendous amount of these kind of
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
projects and if you guys would like as
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%

House Bill 372 I'm welcome to answer any
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
questions you might

have thank you any
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
questions yes
 
01:59:16.350 --> 01:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
weide thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
you Miss Shaw for taking my question um
 
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
I I know you're talking about the leases
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
have been very helpful to communities my
 
01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
question for you is based upon you're
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
saying that bonds may not be able to be
 
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
used your leases are not being done at
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
zero interest I'm presuming over that 20
 
01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
years no they're not done at zero
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
interest over the 20 years and yes there
 
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
is um interest rates you know based on
 
01:59:43.229 --> 01:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
what the market dictates that are are
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
used for these projects but the reality
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
is is that if there is an opportunity
 
01:59:51.069 --> 01:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
for us to use Energy savings to fund
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
these improvements the goal is to not is
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
to make these local communities whole so
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
if they're paying $100 a month on
 
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
utilities and we bring it down to 90
 
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
they're using that $10 difference to pay
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
for the principal and interest of that
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
project over that 20-year term so our
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
goal is not for them to pay anything out
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
of pocket the goal is to reduce enough
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
energy savings so that they can then use
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
that money towards that infrastructure
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
Improvement does that make sense sir
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
coming in thank
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
you the committee We Now call uh Mr Eric
 
02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:42.669 align:start position:0%
you the committee We Now call uh Mr Eric
power

02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
please thank you committee members um Mr
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
chair for the record my name is Eric
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
power um resident of Brookline also ser
 
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
on the brooklane planning board since
 
02:00:58.069 --> 02:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
2021 speaking in favor of this bill uh
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is really needed because I
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
think taxpayers are getting uh way
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
overpaying for projects in in New
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially school districts
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
but also some towns
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
um when you do these lease agreements
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
with Escape Clauses they were really
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
meant to be done with for vehicles and
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
wheel vehicles and such like a fire
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
truck like a DPW vehicle like a police
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
cruiser and that's being done frequently
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
and being done again this year every
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
year because the vehicle can be easily
 
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
returned the vehicle can um be returned
 
02:01:39.790 --> 02:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
without penalty and that's why you have
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
the Escape Clause but when you have
 
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
these lease agreements that are being
 
02:01:47.709 --> 02:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
used to fund Renovations and energy
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
contracts it's it's not the proper
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism it's very expensive
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
the this just this year our Hollis
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
Brooklyn Co-op School District looked at
 
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
doing a 5.3
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
million lease with Escape Clause of for
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
some boilers and energy saving equipment
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we pressed them and said why are you
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
doing this can't you do a bond and they
 
02:02:14.830 --> 02:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
actually re relented after we got after
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
them and and they finally changed their
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
mind and we found that a a bond rate was
 
02:02:20.239 --> 02:02:22.750 align:start position:0%
mind and we found that a a bond rate was
3.84%

02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
3.84%
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
and a lease for that same project was
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
5.45% so it was over 1.6% higher and we
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
had them calculate the budget committee
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
calculated that the just the interest
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
only difference was 1.4 million for the
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
lease so why should the taxpayers pay
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
$1.4 million for a lease agreement with
 
02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
an escape clause which you can't escape
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pull out the boilers
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pull out the LED
 
02:02:52.830 --> 02:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
lighting it doesn't make any sense
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know it's well known in law that
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
that a fixture is an asset that's
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
installed or otherwise fixed into a
 
02:03:00.910 --> 02:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
building or land so that it becomes part
 
02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
building and that's uh that's that's
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's the normal legal definition for
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
it um the other thing that this bill
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
does it it this only this is a narrow
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
exemption case for lease agreements of
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
equipment if you don't fall under this
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
then you fall under RSA 32 327 and RSA
 
02:03:24.669 --> 02:03:24.679 align:start position:0%
33 so this in no way prevents lease
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
agreements lease agreements can still be
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
done lease Agreements are still possible
 
02:03:32.109 --> 02:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
this is a special case of a lease
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that is a carve out but if
 
02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
lease Agreements are still wanted they
 
02:03:38.069 --> 02:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
can still be done and they can compete
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
with bonds the the main reason that
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
lease Agreements are being used in this
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
case is that it gives two advantages
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
which are really at a very high taxpayer
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
expense number one it's not considered
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
long-term debt but number two these leas
 
02:03:55.149 --> 02:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
Agreements are being passed at a simple
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
majority vote and it's not even a ballot
 
02:03:59.470 --> 02:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
vote in a traditional meeting it's just
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
a card vote so you're spending millions
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
of dollars on a simple majority for
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
these lease agreements that are 10 15 or
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
long and taxpayers are way
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
overpaying for a uh a project for these
 
02:04:18.669 --> 02:04:18.679 align:start position:0%
leases leases are still possible this
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
does not stop leases leases can still
 
02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
happen so if you have an energy
 
02:04:26.109 --> 02:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
performance contract it will likely need
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
a three-fifth majority it will still
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
happen it will not pass with a simple
 
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
majority that's the only real difference
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
here and I think that that taxpayers
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
should not have to pay more for the
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
benefit of having a simple majority to
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
pass it it makes no sense so that's I
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
think that's the big rub here and you
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
know I think that that this law will
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
close the loophole and that lease
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
agreements will comp will compete with
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
bonds and other mechanisms on the same
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
footing and not having this advantage of
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
the simple majority to pass them into
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
law so for those reasons and to stop the
 
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
abuse of taxpayers across the state I
 
02:05:09.149 --> 02:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
hope that you find uh you recommend a to
 
02:05:12.189 --> 02:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 372 and I'm willing
 
02:05:14.669 --> 02:05:14.679 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr power any
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
kobby thank you chair thank thank you
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:05:26.589 --> 02:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
um is there a
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
difference uh in a credit rating of a
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
community or a school
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
district when a bond is utilized versus
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
there there's the credit rating is based
 
02:05:49.229 --> 02:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
on the the history of the um and the
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
amount of debt that the school district
 
02:05:53.470 --> 02:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
or the town takes on so it's a function
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
of that if you do the lease agreement
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
that qualifies under this Clause it it
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
is not considered long-term debt because
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
it follows those those those those
 
02:06:05.549 --> 02:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
stages but if you do it outside of this
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
Clause it is considered long-term debt
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
because the statement that it's not
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you Vice chair um if
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
a community in an energy savings
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
environment decided they wanted to
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
replace a Windows for example in a
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
school um and they later decided they
 
02:06:38.109 --> 02:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to return that those windows how
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
do you do
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
that that's a very good question
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan the um thank you
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
for the question the you it's can you
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
return a window that's been installed of
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
course you can is it practical and what
 
02:06:53.709 --> 02:06:53.719 align:start position:0%
are you going to replace it with that's
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
the whole that's the whole capricious
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
argument here is when something becomes
 
02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:58.790 align:start position:0%
argument here is when something becomes
a

02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
fixture can it be returns maybe but it's
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
at Great expense it's not practically
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's not practical from an economic
 
02:07:10.549 --> 02:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
perspective and so you really don't have
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
no one's going to want to vote to stop
 
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
in a lease when the cost to get out of
 
02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
the lease is going to be more than
 
02:07:19.629 --> 02:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
you're paying because you you with the
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
case of a boiler you can't take the
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
boiler out out and not replace it you
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
can't take a window out and not replace
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
it same thing with insulation it's just
 
02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
the wrong mechanism to use a lease
 
02:07:31.629 --> 02:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
agreement for fixtures and that's the
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
point of this law is to avoid that
 
02:07:35.549 --> 02:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
problem so that
 
02:07:38.430 --> 02:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
people so that school districs if they
 
02:07:40.189 --> 02:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
have energy performance and they can if
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
they want to lease some equipment as a
 
02:07:43.709 --> 02:07:43.719 align:start position:0%
question that was earlier they can lease
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
the equipment if it's easily returnable
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't become a fixture but the things
 
02:07:49.709 --> 02:07:49.719 align:start position:0%
they're doing to support that equipment
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
to make it that that become fix
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
that should be done throughout an
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
operating budget or a separate warrant
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
article as a one-time expenditure
 
02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
because you're not going to ever escape
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
that that's a sunk cost thank you for
 
02:08:01.679 --> 02:08:02.750 align:start position:0%
that that's a sunk cost thank you for
the

02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
question any other
 
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
you okay committee like to ask Mr Tom D
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.669 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman if it's okay
 
02:08:31.629 --> 02:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Mike Davy here has filled out a
 
02:08:33.629 --> 02:08:33.639 align:start position:0%
pin card as well we're both uh on behalf
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
of eei so I thought it' be all right if
 
02:08:37.229 --> 02:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
we came up together of course thank you
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
so uh for the record my name is Tom do
 
02:08:40.830 --> 02:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
Roa principal at Main Street strategic
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh I represent energy efficient
 
02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:45.079 align:start position:0%
Investments uh company out of
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
meramac um Mike Davey I'm an owner of
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
energy efficient Investments I live in
 
02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester and we employ 7 72 employees
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
marac so we are here today in opposition
 
02:09:00.549 --> 02:09:00.559 align:start position:0%
to this bill um as the prime sponsor
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned yes it was a refile from last
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
year uh we we caught it when it crossed
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
over to the other uh body um uh and have
 
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
some significant issues with it that
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
that remain at this point um the the one
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the biggest concerns I would say that
 
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
that we have with the the bill is uh
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
some of this has been brought up a
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
little bit here but you're taking away a
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
widget from the free market right
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the opportunity to
 
02:09:25.229 --> 02:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
bond or lease these projects and if you
 
02:09:27.549 --> 02:09:27.559 align:start position:0%
remove the ability to
 
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
lease uh then you're now forcing uh
 
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities into bonding and there
 
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
will be opportunities when bonds are
 
02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
better there will be opportunities when
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
leases are better but at the end of the
 
02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
day if you remove one of those options
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
that cost is shifted down to the
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and that is um certainly
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
something that we all know is uh
 
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes are an issue in the state
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
right and we all uh thank you all for
 
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
the work that you've done to help bring
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
property tax relief over the past few
 
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
sessions to homeowners uh but we see
 
02:09:55.470 --> 02:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
this as something that would uh
 
02:09:57.310 --> 02:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
certainly kind of shift that cost down
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
we also had a couple of legal opinions
 
02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
that were done last year um regarding
 
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
some of this so if it's all right I'll
 
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
just quickly read some things um that uh
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
a couple of attorneys had put together
 
02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
for us one thing on common law right so
 
02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:12.559 align:start position:0%
common law defines what a fixture is uh
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
that establishes a fixture but does not
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
dictate Pro the procedure for municipal
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
leases in the event of a
 
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
non-appropriation of funds that
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
procedure is dictated by the specific
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
language of of the municipal lease
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
agreement um and depending on that
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
language the control and lease agreement
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
the Lesser may have the option but not
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
the obligation to remove the collateral
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the event of non-payment although
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
removement of the collateral may be the
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
only uh remedy available but ultimately
 
02:10:37.709 --> 02:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
lessor is not the municipalities bear
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
the risk that the funds will not be
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate for continued payment under
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
the lease um and then we see
 
02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
this as
 
02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
um just a costeffective way for state
 
02:10:51.549 --> 02:10:51.559 align:start position:0%
and local governments to finance needed
 
02:10:54.750 --> 02:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
improvements um to these buildings and
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
with those Energy savings that M
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned that are realized they can
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
help to offset some of that financing
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
costs the other piece to think about is
 
02:11:04.109 --> 02:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
if we take away this option and there's
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
only bonding available and
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and towns do not want to
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
use their bonding capacity for these
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
projects and we cannot uh maintain our
 
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
buildings we would be looking at decades
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
down the line or maybe sooner for some
 
02:11:17.709 --> 02:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
communities where we're now having to
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
rebuild and put new buildings uh in
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
place of these build that we're not
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
effectively maintaining so for those
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
reasons uh we oppose the bill but I'll
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
let Mr Davy speak to some of the
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
projects and works that he's done around
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
this as well yeah thank you and a lot of
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
the questions that we're debating here
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
are the debates that usually happen in
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
local uh budget committees School boards
 
02:11:39.229 --> 02:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
and select boards and so you might ask
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
if the interest rate could be higher
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
than what the New Hampshire Bond Bank
 
02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
might offer why might a municipality
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
decide to do a lease well there's many
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
advantages to a lease and we've had
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
generally our more conservative ative
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
towns choose the leasing option so for
 
02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
example Lisbon uh Jaffrey ringe um
 
02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
Woodsville considered leasing their
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
boiler uh for the middle school and
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
Candia budget committee unanimously
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
decided to to go with a lease rather
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
than a bond the reason being um you can
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
pay it off early so generally you your
 
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
debt you carry with you if you do a
 
02:12:16.109 --> 02:12:16.119 align:start position:0%
20-year Bond you need to carry it uh
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
leasing allows you to negotiate early
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
payments uh we recently had a a district
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
that wanted to make extra payments in
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
years that they have a surplus so under
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
that scenario where maybe the interest
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
rate is a bit higher in 20 years you
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
might pay a bit more in interest a lot
 
02:12:34.549 --> 02:12:34.559 align:start position:0%
of those um school districts and towns
 
02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
um decide to make extra payments from
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
increased savings and efficiency and pay
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
these leases off earlier um in the other
 
02:12:45.549 --> 02:12:45.559 align:start position:0%
um thing is we have declining enrollment
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
in many rural parts of the state for
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
schools and what the Escape Clause
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
allows you to do
 
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
is if you were to ever close a school
 
02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
because you're going to redistrict the
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
students it's much easier and and in um
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
New Mexico there were many um districts
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
that had used the lease option and then
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
they were able to um sell the building
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
the lease went with the sale where bonds
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
typically you have to carry for the
 
02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
entire 20-year debt so for that reason
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
when the city of Franklin acquired um
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
they had a school close the city
 
02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
acquired um the r School turned it into
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
a community center and they did a lease
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement in a very
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
conservative town uh they thought that
 
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
was the best option for them to retrofit
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
that building and they turned it into a
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
senior center they also that same body
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
um used a uh a lease format in Franklin
 
02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
to upgrade uh the city hall boiler they
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to preserve their bonding
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
capacity for other capital projects and
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to use a lease with Energy
 
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
savings to pay for it similarly the city
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
of nasua we just completed a $7 million
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
tax neutral energy lease to North and
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
South High School they needed their
 
02:13:59.950 --> 02:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
bonding capacity for um projects that
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
were um uh planned for renovating the
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
middle school and doing an addition uh
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester also has a huge amount of its
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
capital tied up in a major um uh water
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
sewer separation project and also um the
 
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
the school Beach Street school project
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
so Manchester is looking at leasing to
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
do the boiler upgrades the city of
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth did a major uh Wastewater
 
02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
project they're also so that tied up
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
their bonding capacity and so leases is
 
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
the way to upgrade your boilers upgrade
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
your HVAC system uh with the lowest tax
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
impact and unlike a bond it can be paid
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
off early and you can not um negotiate
 
02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:42.030 align:start position:0%
off early and you can not um negotiate
flexible

02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.229 --> 02:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:57.510 --> 02:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr
 
02:15:26.109 --> 02:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
FL good morning Mr chairman and members
 
02:15:28.109 --> 02:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you uh my name is
 
02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
Brendan flarey I'm with the DuPont group
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
and I here today on behalf of siries um
 
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
who's a nonprofit advocacy organization
 
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
um with a lot of businesses here in New
 
02:15:40.430 --> 02:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I'm here today um to
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to House Bill uh
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
372 and our opposition kind of broadly
 
02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
falls into two categories uh real
 
02:15:51.629 --> 02:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
quickly uh it uh uh government
 
02:15:53.069 --> 02:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
efficiency and control and
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um development and
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
investment um and I think as Mr D Ro's
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
testimony uh pointed out uh HB
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
372 um undermines local control and
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility um it imposes kind of an
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh state level restriction
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
with that 3- fifths uh majority vote um
 
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
to enter into lease agreements um and
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
that in turn makes government less
 
02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
efficient um it prevents municipalities
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
and schools from implementing those
 
02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
important Capital uh improvements um and
 
02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh addressing delayed maintenance of
 
02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:27.390 align:start position:0%
uh addressing delayed maintenance of
critical

02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
critical
 
02:16:30.669 --> 02:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um and series uh sees
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
that as an unnecessary prohibition uh
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
the second part of our opposition um
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
around infrastructure and Energy
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
Efficiency Investments um we also view
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
this bill uh as a hindrance to um
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
developing that infrastructure and we
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
were recommend um itl um to ensure that
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
Municipal governments have the options
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
they need uh to finance critical
 
02:16:54.669 --> 02:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Investments um and
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
finally on the uh Energy Efficiency side
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
um series uh is supportive of Energy
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and uh projects wherever they
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
can uh get them so um again 372 is a uh
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
a hindrance on those efforts as well at
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
the municipal level so with that I'm
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
02:17:22.110 --> 02:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
Lan is it it's when it's red awesome I
 
02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
haven't done this for a while um thank
 
02:17:51.389 --> 02:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you for having having me this
 
02:17:53.549 --> 02:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is Lori Lane and I am
 
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
the superintendent of schools for the
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield school district and I'm here
 
02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
to today to ask you to oppose HB
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
372 this bill seeks to amend RSA 33 col
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
7-e which currently allows a governing
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
body such as a local school board the
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
authority to enter into lease agreements
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
as a funding source for various types of
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
equipment including equipment purchased
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
as part of a building a building bus and
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
Facilities improvements and
 
02:18:26.349 --> 02:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
Renovations the proposed Bill seeks to
 
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
change the RSA by preventing school
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
boards and municipalities from being
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
able to finance the purchase of
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
equipment that becomes a fixture and
 
02:18:37.629 --> 02:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
that's in quotes because there's that's
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
one of the changes in the in the
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in a building with any kind
 
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
of lease agreements including Energy
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency focused performance lease
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
agreements I'm asking you to oppose this
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
bill because it's unclear to me why the
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to limit the option
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
for school boards and communities on how
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
they choose to fund Capital Improvements
 
02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
to their schools performance lease
 
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
agreements allow school districts
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
another option besides raising taxes and
 
02:19:07.950 --> 02:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
taking out long-term bonds to fund
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
projects to keep their school building
 
02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
safe for Learning and working in a state
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that Prides itself on local control and
 
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
local decision making I find it puzzling
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the legislature would want to limit
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
the local a local community's ability to
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
make its own funding decisions entering
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
into a performance lease agreement to
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
pay for necessary HVAC equipment boiler
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
plant Replacements and lighting
 
02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
equipment upgrades will result in
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
increased Energy Efficiency while at the
 
02:19:41.469 --> 02:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
same time allow school districts to save
 
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars in
 
02:19:46.509 --> 02:19:46.519 align:start position:0%
operating costs each year depending on
 
02:19:48.309 --> 02:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
the scope of the capital Improvement
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
project performance lease agreements can
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
be can make these projects cost neutral
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
for school districts for example when I
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
worked in the summersworth school
 
02:19:59.309 --> 02:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
district the school board approved
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
entering into two different cost neutral
 
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
performance leases one for a schoolwide
 
02:20:08.670 --> 02:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
HVAC system and the other for
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
districtwide lighting retrofit project
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
the performance lease annual payments
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
for these projects were entirely offset
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
by the Energy savings the district
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
experienced there were no new taxes
 
02:20:24.990 --> 02:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
raised to pay for either of these
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
projects in closing school boards and
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
communities have many challenges as they
 
02:20:32.429 --> 02:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
look for ways to manage the rising costs
 
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
of aging and energy inefficient
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
buildings losing the performance lease
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
option would significantly hamper School
 
02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
District's ability to address aging
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and inefficiencies in a
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
cost effective way and with that in mind
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
I ask you to oppose HP 372 I thank you
 
02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative Comey thank you
 
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
question um and not sure how long you've
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
been a educator but we greatly
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate you gray hair a long time 35
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
years ma'am wow all right then maybe you
 
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
can answer this question um what does it
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
look like
 
02:21:24.190 --> 02:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh when and it was touched on a little
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
bit but what does it look like when a
 
02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:28.429 align:start position:0%
bit but what does it look like when a
bond

02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
bond
 
02:21:31.469 --> 02:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
is taken out for a
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
project uh you might be 10 years into a
 
02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.349 align:start position:0%
project uh you might be 10 years into a
20-year

02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
20-year
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
Bond and that school is
 
02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
closed what happens to the other 10
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
payments so a bond versus the lease
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
correct so my understanding is the bond
 
02:21:55.389 --> 02:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
the debt remains so the districts need
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
to figure out how they're going to
 
02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
continue to pay for that so you know and
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's closing a school it's or in
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
a partnership with another school
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
district so when I was in summersworth
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford also um was a part of that
 
02:22:15.309 --> 02:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
SAU at one time and so there was
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford would also be assuming some
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the debt when they return when they
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
remove their students from the school so
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
they have to continue to do that whereas
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
like you know as as you've heard another
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
testimony you know you can pay those
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
leases off um early which which is an
 
02:22:35.710 --> 02:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
attractive option I mean I just hope we
 
02:22:38.670 --> 02:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
don't limit what we try to do we schools
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
we we try to be very creative in what we
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
do and how we fund projects and our
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our buildings are getting
 
02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
older and whether they you know get
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
repurposed for other things or they end
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
up you know serving
 
02:22:52.990 --> 02:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
um you know school students in a
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
different capacity um you know I I just
 
02:22:57.630 --> 02:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
feel it's it's important for us to be
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
able to cre be as creative as possible
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
and not have our opportunities limited I
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
think it's important for us to be very
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
transparent about what we're doing and
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
some of the comments I've heard that
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
that it kind of sounds like that's not
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
been the case um that's not the case you
 
02:23:15.269 --> 02:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
know I feel like my my colleagues and I
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
do a do an excellent job of trying to
 
02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that voters and the school
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
boards are very aware of what's what
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're asking for terrific thank you
 
02:23:24.319 --> 02:23:25.309 align:start position:0%
we're asking for terrific thank you
you're

02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you ma'am for coming in
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
whoops I'm sorry oh representative
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
Walker thank you Mr Vice
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
chair leasing small dollar items baffles
 
02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
me in I'm from Rochester in Rochester
 
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
when we have a budget I live in
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
Rochester so we have the capital side uh
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
the bonding side and we have a cash side
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
small items like this we would put a
 
02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
cash reserve on it and pay it off we
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to pay any interest rates
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
is whatever so we don't do small leasing
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
on building fixtures or anything like
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
that we use cash items we have two two
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
pots of money now as administrator
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't your District do that that sort
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
of thing have a cash side and a and a
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
bonding side well you have different
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
options to fund so one of the projects
 
02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
that we did in summersworth was uh to we
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
had all these old so think about old
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
hotels these unit ventilators and they
 
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
were incredibly inefficient this project
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
was about a million dollars we took all
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
of those out and put in a ducted system
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
um this was in
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
2019 and so we didn't have uh a capital
 
02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
improve like a like a reserve fund there
 
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
there was nothing we we got some we
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
leveraged funds from uh School building
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
Aid um and we got some from the city we
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
asked for uh funds to help support the
 
02:25:00.349 --> 02:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
project but there there wasn't another
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
option and we were like how how could we
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
possibly do this and so in working with
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
you know eei was the company we worked
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
with as part of one of the
 
02:25:10.349 --> 02:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
subcontractors with this project that we
 
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
were able to to say we're going to save
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
this amount money money in um in Energy
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
savings so we reduced the amount of um
 
02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
energy costs for the school by like 25
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
26,000 and those that money went to
 
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
paying for the lease so that's the cost
 
02:25:32.349 --> 02:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
neutral part I'm not sure I'm answering
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
your question but but that's how it
 
02:25:37.389 --> 02:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
worked and so you know I think I think
 
02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
schools have a responsibility to look at
 
02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
all different options and you know
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
whether you can go to the city and ask
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
for um support whether it's through the
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislature whether it you know with um
 
02:25:52.269 --> 02:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
and the the Department of Education to
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
get funds for you know School building
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
Aid I mean I think there's a lot of
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
different things but you know for some
 
02:25:59.710 --> 02:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
communities a million dollars million
 
02:26:02.269 --> 02:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
and a half I think it was that that HVAC
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
project was was a lot of money and so
 
02:26:07.389 --> 02:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
this was how we chose to we chose to
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
make um to fund that project thank you
 
02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:12.389 align:start position:0%
make um to fund that project thank you
you're

02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
02:26:16.990 --> 02:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thanks for coming
 
02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.790 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thanks for coming
in

02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
ma'am okay m said Dean and
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
sir I'd like to thank the members of the
 
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
committee for uh having us speak today
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here to speak in opposition to HB
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
372 uh I work for Johnson Controls I am
 
02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
the account executive uh that does uh
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
energy performance Contracting through
 
02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
all of New England uh to make that short
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's Maine Vermont and New Hampshire
 
02:26:59.469 --> 02:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
um some things I I I just want to point
 
02:27:01.469 --> 02:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
out that I've heard throughout this
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
meeting uh we we we're hearing about
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
bonds we're hearing about tax exemp
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
purchases and what I've heard is that
 
02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
apparently the tax assembly purchases
 
02:27:14.750 --> 02:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
has a higher cost if we look at the
 
02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
definition of an energy performance
 
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
contract the energy performance contract
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
is set up so that the Energy savings
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
that are guaranteed by the Esco the
 
02:27:27.630 --> 02:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
Energy Services Company are there to
 
02:27:30.990 --> 02:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
completely offset all costs for the
 
02:27:33.150 --> 02:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
project um and that's the way we build
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
our projects and we do it in a in a
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
manner with all of our customers that is
 
02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:37.950 align:start position:0%
manner with all of our customers that is
100%

02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
100%
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
transparent um even down to markups and
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature so that our
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
customers understand how the costs are
 
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
allocated and how that tax is least
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
purchased is set up so that the Energy
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
savings are guaranteed to offset that
 
02:27:58.990 --> 02:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
debt so whether you go to a bond and to
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
me a bond automatically means a tax
 
02:28:04.110 --> 02:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
implication or whether you go to a tax
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
tax exemple purchase to me is a fiscal
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's a fiscal decision made by a a
 
02:28:12.910 --> 02:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
committee at a school or a municipality
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
to say I want to put all my debt here
 
02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
and have it completely offset by Energy
 
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
savings or if I'm going to use a bond
 
02:28:22.269 --> 02:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
toay pay this off I'm going to be going
 
02:28:24.750 --> 02:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
back to my taxpayers at some point for
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
possibly a increase in their taxes
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's something that we've always
 
02:28:31.389 --> 02:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
fought to avoid uh in building these
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
projects they take a great deal of time
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
to put together um and there's a great
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
deal of information that's shared
 
02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
between the Energy Services Company and
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
the customer so that when you get down
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
to final presentations and final
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
decision-making processes that
 
02:28:49.389 --> 02:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
everything is above board um and I think
 
02:28:51.389 --> 02:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
I've said this a million times to my
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
customers if I can prove it to you on
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
paper if I can show you the cash flow
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
and show you where the eyes are dotted
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the tees are cross and guarantee
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
that these savings will offset your debt
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
obligation is there any reason why you
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to move forward with this
 
02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
type of
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
arrangement I have a school system in uh
 
02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
in uh New England uh where we have done
 
02:29:14.590 --> 02:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
three phases of energy work energy
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
performance work uh over the last 10
 
02:29:20.190 --> 02:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
years in 10 years we've reduced our
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
total energy spend to date by half
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
measured and verifiable which equates to
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
I believe just a little over $5 million
 
02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 years that's a
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
pretty significant sum of money in a
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
small small town in New England um I
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
could say that uh to move forward with
 
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation is going to
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
restrict the ability of uh Energy
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
Services companies like uh my colleagues
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
and I sitting here today to come out and
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh prove prove that you know in each
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
instance we are trying to do the best
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we can to help municipalities small
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities medium municipalities
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
large municipalities make the most of
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
every budgetary dollar that they have I
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
don't look to go to my customers and
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
seek Capital funding for their projects
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
what I do is I go to my customers and
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
say what can I do to get you the things
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
that you need and fit it all into
 
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
something that is cost contained and
 
02:30:18.269 --> 02:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
does not impact the tax implications for
 
02:30:20.269 --> 02:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
your constituents
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I I would hope that uh
 
02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing then thanks for coming
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
in sir I appreciate it thank
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
you our last speaker
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Sam Evans
 
02:30:58.950 --> 02:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
Brown I'm the executive director of
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire uh one of the
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
benefits of going last is I don't have a
 
02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
great deal to add in addition to what
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
the folks who are real experts in this
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
have already stated um I would just say
 
02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire as an
 
02:31:12.269 --> 02:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
organization represents many of the
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
energy service companies uh that that
 
02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
are here before you uh as as members of
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
our of our business membership but also
 
02:31:21.389 --> 02:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
closing in I was actually looking at the
 
02:31:23.070 --> 02:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
the little blurb on the back of Our
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
Testimony which needs updating we're
 
02:31:26.309 --> 02:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
closing in on 50 municipalities in the
 
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that we provide
 
02:31:30.190 --> 02:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
technical assistance in in pursuing
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
clean energy projects in their own towns
 
02:31:35.469 --> 02:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
and so we uh serve as sort of a uh you
 
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
know vendor neutral nonpartisan actor in
 
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
this space and I would just say there
 
02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
are a great number of communities that
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
are using these Energy Services
 
02:31:45.070 --> 02:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
Contracting lease arrangements to save
 
02:31:47.710 --> 02:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
money for their taxpayers uh and just in
 
02:31:49.150 --> 02:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
very simple terms I think that the
 
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill is going to result
 
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
in in higher expenses for uh New
 
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire residents so I I
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
see it as a a problem in search of a
 
02:31:59.790 --> 02:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me a solution in search of a
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
problem um which I think is exactly why
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoed this last year uh
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
just for a bit of legislative history I
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
think the reason that it got over to the
 
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
Senate it with uh a unanimous
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that most of us just
 
02:32:13.469 --> 02:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
didn't notice it we missed it uh last
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
year uh and sort of swung into action
 
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
once we saw this bill uh and and
 
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
realized what it what it meant which is
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
why you're seeing such a um you know an
 
02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
array of folks coming out to oppose it
 
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
today uh so uh with that said I will I
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
will let my written testimony speak for
 
02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
itself um if folks have questions for me
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer them but I would
 
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
urge you to uh con you know recommend
 
02:32:37.870 --> 02:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh in expedient to
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thanks for coming
 
02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:46.910 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thanks for coming
in

02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
sir okay that was the last pain card is
 
02:32:51.550 --> 02:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
there anyone else in the audience that
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.030 --> 02:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
none when you're ready representative
 
02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
none when you're ready representative

thank you Mr chair um for the remote
 
02:33:25.269 --> 02:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
signin we had three in support of this
 
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
bill and uh 29 in
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
opposition and on the paper blue sheet
 
02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
we had uh four in opposition and one uh
 
02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%

so with that that concludes our publicly
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
noticed hearings for today and before we
 
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
go to lunch um

announcements so um we're going we're

04:14:49.950 --> 04:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
move into executive sessions and I do
 
04:14:52.990 --> 04:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
apologize for the slightly delayed start
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
but the Republicans um decided to caucus
 
04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.710 --> 04:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
bill so um we have a lot of amendments
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
floating around and after lunch you
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
probably when you come came back
 
04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
probably saw an explosion of paper had
 
04:15:16.109 --> 04:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
your Des areas so I I will go slowly
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
through the executive session in order
 
04:15:21.870 --> 04:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
to um allow enough time for the
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
committee members to sort themselves out
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.269 --> 04:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
bill so at this time I will open the
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
569 relative to the establishment of
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
at this time I would like to offer
 
04:15:49.520 --> 04:15:51.550 align:start position:0%
at this time I would like to offer
amendment

04:15:51.550 --> 04:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:15:55.950 --> 04:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
20255 61h to House Bill
 
04:16:00.030 --> 04:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
569 so this amendment
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
um addresses feedback that we heard um
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
during the hearing and I worked with the
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor on this amendment and the
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
first thing that it does
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
is it added in governing bodies of
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities um into
 
04:16:27.870 --> 04:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
that may include themselves in the the
 
04:16:30.990 --> 04:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
this planning committee and also um
 
04:16:34.830 --> 04:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.469 --> 04:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
language states that this shall be an op
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
in provision rather than an opt out
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
provision as the bill had been F that
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
seems to make um more sense and it also
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
provides that governing bodies of
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities can vote to join uh the
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
communications District planning
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
committee at a future time and um if the
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
communications District um is
 
04:17:04.830 --> 04:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
established they may also vote to to
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
future so is there a second
 
04:17:16.990 --> 04:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
on well I I just I seriously messed up
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right I forgot that I was
 
04:17:21.750 --> 04:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to offer this and then ask for
 
04:17:24.109 --> 04:17:24.119 align:start position:0%
a second so let me back up so I'd like
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
to offer this amendment is there a
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
second represent Colby seconds it yes
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um I'm not I I don't need to
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
repeat my little explanation does
 
04:17:39.389 --> 04:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything that they
 
04:17:42.189 --> 04:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
would like to um say with regards to the
 
04:17:42.199 --> 04:17:47.790 align:start position:0%
would like to um say with regards to the
amendment

04:17:47.790 --> 04:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:47.800 --> 04:17:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
grund the one thing I'd like to say is
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh making an opt
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
in further com um representative Walker
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes just a
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
little uh typographical here you mention
 
04:18:08.910 --> 04:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's in h uh tyze and bold or governing
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
bodies of a county should it say
 
04:18:13.469 --> 04:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
governing bodies govern bodies of a
 
04:18:15.109 --> 04:18:15.119 align:start position:0%
county in the other paragraph that's
 
04:18:15.119 --> 04:18:16.030 align:start position:0%
county in the other paragraph that's
being

04:18:16.030 --> 04:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
changed because I was told by my County
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that a county is not a
 
04:18:25.870 --> 04:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
municipality um yes that so just to be
 
04:18:29.710 --> 04:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
clear it's governing bodies of two or
 
04:18:32.109 --> 04:18:32.119 align:start position:0%
more municipalities that that that's the
 
04:18:34.309 --> 04:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
language that's already in statute and
 
04:18:36.870 --> 04:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of the bill is that
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
the governing body of a county might
 
04:18:43.990 --> 04:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
also initiate this study um um
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee so that was the whole purpose
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill so that's why that you see
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
both of those Provisions that two or
 
04:18:57.550 --> 04:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
more municipalities may form a a
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
um the this Communications District
 
04:19:00.479 --> 04:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
um the this Communications District
planning

04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
planning
 
04:19:05.309 --> 04:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
committee or a second option would be
 
04:19:08.109 --> 04:19:08.119 align:start position:0%
that the governing body of a county
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
meaning the Commissioners could
 
04:19:15.750 --> 04:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
also stand up the planning
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee that was the whole premise of
 
04:19:20.349 --> 04:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
the bill is to enable at the county
 
04:19:31.070 --> 04:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.149 --> 04:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
done further questions or comments or
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
debate so the motion before us right now
 
04:19:42.750 --> 04:19:42.760 align:start position:0%

04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%

04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
our committee in the last session um and
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%

have it again this time to look at um
 
04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
communities like mine in Lebanon now
 
04:39:52.868 --> 04:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
have a casino that had we had this
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
option in place we probably wouldn't
 
04:39:58.350 --> 04:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
have the casino right now um I think
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
that it is only prudent to give
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
residents the U option of having a
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
referendum on whether they want these
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
establishments in their communities or
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%

provides an optin provision that is
 
04:40:24.750 --> 04:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
similar that we have currently in
 
04:40:29.550 --> 04:40:29.560 align:start position:0%

04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
been here a long time or not this was
 
04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
something that was new I think it should
 
04:45:42.990 --> 04:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
have gone to ways and means but we had
 
04:45:44.750 --> 04:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
that discussion tongue and cheek but
 
04:45:47.390 --> 04:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
seriously also hopefully it is going to
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
go there as a second committee because I
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
think that's where where it belongs but
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the primary reasons
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
why I'm going to vote um in favor of the
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
amendment is really speaks to the bill
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
and the issue at large which is that uh
 
04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
these revenues really need to be
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
captured by the local communities uh up
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
there who are otherwise hurting we we at
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
a time right now where um those revenues
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
are being lost they're being sold to
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
other states or maybe just and other
 
04:46:18.878 --> 04:46:19.868 align:start position:0%
other states or maybe just and other
state

04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
California um uh where these credits are
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
being sold to another state who are
 
04:46:27.628 --> 04:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
reaping the benefits of our good
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
stewardship um I think that those
 
04:46:31.390 --> 04:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
revenues should be captured by the state
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh and for those
 
04:46:35.708 --> 04:46:35.718 align:start position:0%
reasons I I can recommend or I can
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
support the recommendation of the
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I have a few comments and and so this
 
04:46:50.190 --> 04:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
legislation before
 
04:46:53.548 --> 04:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
us involves the the timber tax which we
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
already have and as as we know the
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
timber tax is assessed on Timber when it
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
is cut for sale so the assessment is
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's a yield tax and this is not a
 
04:47:10.030 --> 04:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
new tax because under the carbon
 
04:47:13.708 --> 04:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
sequestration program the timber is
 
04:47:13.718 --> 04:47:15.948 align:start position:0%
sequestration program the timber is
being

04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:47:18.830 --> 04:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
sold however it's not being
 
04:47:23.430 --> 04:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
cut so I in my mind it's very clear that
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a new tax it's what's new is
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's a new way to sell the timber
 
04:47:34.110 --> 04:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
therefore it's appropriate that this
 
04:47:39.310 --> 04:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
yield tax be assessed for trees that are
 
04:47:42.628 --> 04:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
have been sequestered for the carbon um
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
credits this is an important issue it
 
04:47:56.110 --> 04:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a new
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
issue that the states need to um address
 
04:48:03.948 --> 04:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
through legislation and and through
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
policy and it's my understanding that
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and other legislators
 
04:48:14.430 --> 04:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
and other individuals
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
um in the state have been working on
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
this issue for many years so while this
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
bill comes before us here and now in
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
this legislative session this is
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
something that people have been looking
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
into thinking about
 
04:48:34.040 --> 04:48:37.030 align:start position:0%
into thinking about
discussing

04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and there was a bill last year that
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
established a carbon registry and this
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
would be a second piece of
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to um
 
04:48:53.948 --> 04:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
address um the issue that this bill
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
seeks to
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
04:48:59.718 --> 04:49:02.990 align:start position:0%
um I guess
solve

04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
and to be clear we heard during during
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
the hearings we heard testimony
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
that as a result of carbon sequestration
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
program that municipalities are um the
 
04:49:20.470 --> 04:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
revenue because of the fact that these
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
this Timber is being locked up in these
 
04:49:23.680 --> 04:49:25.190 align:start position:0%
this Timber is being locked up in these
um

04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
carbon in these contracts for carbon
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
credits that is um greatly affecting the
 
04:49:32.160 --> 04:49:33.150 align:start position:0%
credits that is um greatly affecting the
timber

04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
timber
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
industry and the harvesting and the a
 
04:49:39.708 --> 04:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
large percentage of New Hampshire is
 
04:49:39.718 --> 04:49:41.190 align:start position:0%
large percentage of New Hampshire is
forested

04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
forested
 
04:49:43.708 --> 04:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
and the timber industry is an important
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
industry in our
 
04:49:50.350 --> 04:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
state and we need to um we need to
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
address this here and now and not kick
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
this can down the road any
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
further there um I I feel I've worked
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
very closely with the the prime sponsor
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
and other
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives as this bill um has been
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
worked on since since the hearing
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
and I am confident in in in the language
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
that is before us um today in this
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and I fully support it and for
 
04:50:24.270 --> 04:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
those who are
 
04:50:28.830 --> 04:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that it might not be on target
 
04:50:32.190 --> 04:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
I would say that like any legislation
 
04:50:32.200 --> 04:50:33.030 align:start position:0%
I would say that like any legislation
that

04:50:33.030 --> 04:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
is brand new there's always the
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity for housekeeping bill in a
 
04:50:42.270 --> 04:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
subsequent year and and to reiterate I'm
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
I'm very confident in in what this
 
04:50:49.070 --> 04:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
amendment in this bill um would do and I
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the State of
 
04:50:55.310 --> 04:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and our
 
04:51:00.910 --> 04:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:06.030 --> 04:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
comments okay so y oh oh I'm sorry
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative grund so I'll be brief
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
but I just I want to say I appreciate
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
everything you said Madam chair
 
04:51:13.470 --> 04:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
chairwoman I I agree with where you were
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
going with that and I have gone back and
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
forth and I have struggled with this one
 
04:51:20.548 --> 04:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
for multiple weeks as I've talked to
 
04:51:24.430 --> 04:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
many people and I kept going back to you
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
know the the effect on our industry um
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
looking at what is when you look at
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
business you look at what's a taxable
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
event and what triggers those things and
 
04:51:34.750 --> 04:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
understanding the timber industry
 
04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
starting to understand a little bit more
 
04:51:39.150 --> 04:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
about how carbon sequestration falls
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
under I feel like it's cre at ated that
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
event so it falls under that yield tax
 
04:51:45.868 --> 04:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
about the timber so I do support the
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
amendment in the Bill further comments
 
04:51:49.440 --> 04:51:50.230 align:start position:0%
amendment in the Bill further comments
or

04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:51:55.390 --> 04:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you madam chair and I would
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
just like to um thank the speaker I
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
guess for sending this bill to our
 
04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee because it's really kind of
 
04:52:06.510 --> 04:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
expanded our Horizons and made us um
 
04:52:09.628 --> 04:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
stretch intellectually in ways that we
 
04:52:12.270 --> 04:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
don't normally have to and I I really do
 
04:52:12.280 --> 04:52:15.150 align:start position:0%
don't normally have to and I I really do
appreciate

04:52:15.150 --> 04:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
that further
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
comments I'm seeing none the motion
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
before us is to
 
04:52:24.480 --> 04:52:26.150 align:start position:0%

04:57:27.628 --> 04:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
motion to accept the amendment yes I
 
04:57:30.270 --> 04:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
would um as when we had the hearing a
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago one of the some of the
 
04:57:34.270 --> 04:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions that came up was who is going
 
04:57:38.110 --> 04:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh oversee where the signs
 
04:57:40.948 --> 04:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
would would be placed and there was also
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
questioning as far as electioneering so
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
working with representative Murphy and
 
04:57:48.510 --> 04:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
also I spoke with the prime sponsor of
 
04:57:50.548 --> 04:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
the bill they were comfortable with the
 
04:57:52.708 --> 04:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
amendment was being offered which would
 
04:57:54.750 --> 04:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
basically allow the municipalities to
 
04:57:57.070 --> 04:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
make their own decision whether they
 
04:57:59.070 --> 04:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
allow or disallow the signs is based
 
04:58:01.628 --> 04:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
upon local ordinance at that point and
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
the only part with the election heing
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
that got put in there was just so that
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
way the municipality didn't decide to
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
put something where they're not supposed
 
04:58:10.390 --> 04:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
to put it so that way we make sure we
 
04:58:13.548 --> 04:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
rules thank you are there any comments
 
04:58:16.320 --> 04:58:18.270 align:start position:0%
rules thank you are there any comments
representative

04:58:18.270 --> 04:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:58:21.868 --> 04:58:21.878 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Madame chairman um I
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
just noticed this sitting here uh for
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
the last 10
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
minutes the use of the words local sign
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
ordinances typically
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
um signs are regulated under zoning
 
04:58:39.548 --> 04:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
ordinances in towns that have zoning
 
04:58:39.558 --> 04:58:41.548 align:start position:0%
ordinances in towns that have zoning
ordinance

04:58:41.548 --> 04:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
04:58:43.948 --> 04:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
and correct me if my
 
04:58:48.910 --> 04:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but zoning only regulates
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
private real property I don't think
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.708 --> 04:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.080 --> 04:59:13.868 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
comments representative Walker
 
04:59:20.430 --> 04:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
yeah in Rochester we have a signed
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance that's in the the zoning
 
04:59:25.628 --> 04:59:25.638 align:start position:0%
ordinances B it's part of the site plan
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
review and so this
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
is basically what we're doing in
 
04:59:33.510 --> 04:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester we mimic the state law so they
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
don't allow any in Rochester except on
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
private property but this would change
 
04:59:38.760 --> 04:59:40.590 align:start position:0%
private property but this would change
that

04:59:40.590 --> 04:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
further comments representative Gilman
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I think the
 
04:59:48.030 --> 04:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
ordinance that's being referred to here
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
could be referred to here is one set by
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
the governing body uh for example exitor
 
04:59:56.948 --> 04:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
has a an ordinance to do to deal with
 
05:00:00.430 --> 05:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
winter parking a winter parking ban or
 
05:00:03.150 --> 05:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh what parks can and can't have dogs
 
05:00:06.310 --> 05:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
and this would fit into that I believe
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me um where signs can and can't
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
be placed and in fact
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
we also have something in our ordinance
 
05:00:12.400 --> 05:00:14.510 align:start position:0%
we also have something in our ordinance
about

05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
Elward yes in our town it's they're
 
05:00:24.670 --> 05:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
governed under our zoning
 
05:00:24.680 --> 05:00:26.270 align:start position:0%
governed under our zoning
ordinance

05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
so the zoning ordinance
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
governs personal real
 
05:00:36.270 --> 05:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
property not Municipal
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
property so I I have trouble with the
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
frases and I can't support the
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
amendment further comments
 
05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative frock thank you madam
 
05:00:51.150 --> 05:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Elward is in
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
fact correct in that um Municipal
 
05:00:58.830 --> 05:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
governments state government federal
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
government are exempt from all local
 
05:01:07.868 --> 05:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
zoning unless the property is used for
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
commercial purposes
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
pretty sure about
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
comments I have a
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
comment and it's similar to
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
representative Walker my understanding
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
that this amendment would
 
05:01:28.040 --> 05:01:30.070 align:start position:0%
that this amendment would
simply

05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
simply
 
05:01:34.310 --> 05:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
codify the F the fact that
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities can establish where or we
 
05:01:38.878 --> 05:01:41.590 align:start position:0%
municipalities can establish where or we
not

05:01:41.590 --> 05:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:01:44.910 --> 05:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
signs political signs can can be placed
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
I know that in the the town that I live
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
in they currently do that with regards
 
05:01:52.910 --> 05:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
to political signs they have a local
 
05:01:54.868 --> 05:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
ordinance that says you can put them
 
05:01:58.150 --> 05:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
here but you can't put them over here so
 
05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
to me this is not changing the statute
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
that much except for saying specifically
 
05:02:10.548 --> 05:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
that municipalities can make these
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
determinations and we have this in
 
05:02:15.270 --> 05:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
writing within the
 
05:02:20.430 --> 05:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
law so I support this amendment further
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
Elward in response to your comment um
 
05:02:31.150 --> 05:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
you said that you have an ordinance that
 
05:02:33.628 --> 05:02:33.638 align:start position:0%
says the signs can be placed here or
 
05:02:36.830 --> 05:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
there are you referring to here and
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%

to speak to your motion yes thank you
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair I think this uh proposal
 
05:12:20.910 --> 05:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
proposed bill would handcuff the
 
05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
authorized board or the appointing board
 
05:12:26.070 --> 05:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the case of uh filling a
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy I could see where they might not
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
even uh consider somebody that's ran in
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
the last three elections because that
 
05:12:40.548 --> 05:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't open up the requirement that
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
they offer it to the runner up in one of
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
the previous elections and if that
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
person is a fringe type uh
 
05:12:52.830 --> 05:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
candidate U they might not be able to
 
05:12:54.670 --> 05:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
have the person that might be best
 
05:12:57.788 --> 05:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
suited to fill the position for the town
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
or School District thank
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
you further comments or discussion
 
05:13:03.280 --> 05:13:04.470 align:start position:0%
you further comments or discussion
representative

05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
grund thank you so the other piece um
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
and I want I appreciate the uh to me the
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
will of the voter is the will of the
 
05:13:14.430 --> 05:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
voter at the time of a vote not three
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
years afterwards um the other piece is
 
05:13:19.390 --> 05:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
it never addressed Cooperative school
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
districts so if that falls under RSA 671
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
colon 33 comma 4 and that has to do with
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
so in my town we actually had this
 
05:13:31.628 --> 05:13:31.638 align:start position:0%
happen um so hean School District
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
Amhurst has five School me school board
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
members Mont Vernon has two one resigned
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
from Mont Vernon one person from Vernon
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
cannot choose the other appointee so it
 
05:13:44.430 --> 05:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the board of Selectmen this does
 
05:13:46.510 --> 05:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
not address that at
 
05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
all thank you further
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
05:13:54.830 --> 05:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chairwoman and uh
 
05:13:56.830 --> 05:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
the question also came up what happens
 
05:13:59.070 --> 05:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
if there was a tie in one of those
 
05:14:01.150 --> 05:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
elections um who would it go to there
 
05:14:03.788 --> 05:14:03.798 align:start position:0%
was no answer to that question either so
 
05:14:03.798 --> 05:14:05.110 align:start position:0%
was no answer to that question either so
they

05:14:05.110 --> 05:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:14:07.990 --> 05:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
mechanic which has happened I'm well
 
05:14:10.510 --> 05:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
aware you're well aare of
 
05:14:13.390 --> 05:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
it so there there there are I get what
 
05:14:15.310 --> 05:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
the what the sponsor is trying to do I
 
05:14:17.070 --> 05:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
certainly get what he's trying to do but
 
05:14:18.548 --> 05:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of this bill don't get
 
05:14:22.310 --> 05:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
them there thank you further comments I
 
05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
I would agree that the the bill is not
 
05:14:27.788 --> 05:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time there's a there's a
 
05:14:30.548 --> 05:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
lot of um technical issues that that
 
05:14:33.670 --> 05:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
weren't uh um perhaps thought of and
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
addressed so I support the
 
05:14:41.150 --> 05:14:41.160 align:start position:0%

to speak to your motion sure um well I
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
think we can all appreciate um the issue
 
05:17:09.868 --> 05:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
that this is trying to help with the
 
05:17:11.548 --> 05:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
homelessness crisis that we have here in
 
05:17:13.628 --> 05:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think taking it to the
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
point of no liability for the M for the
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities um is just going a bit
 
05:17:20.430 --> 05:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
kind of too far and there's some
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances especially when you get
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
into intention and what's intentional
 
05:17:29.110 --> 05:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
and not um which is why I'm moving for
 
05:17:32.430 --> 05:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
itl Thank You Is there further comments
 
05:17:32.440 --> 05:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
itl Thank You Is there further comments
or

05:17:37.510 --> 05:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:40.350 --> 05:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
discussion so a concern that I have with
 
05:17:43.110 --> 05:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is whenever we're um this would
 
05:17:46.510 --> 05:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
fall under the realm of Public Safety
 
05:17:48.430 --> 05:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
and also there there may be health
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
concerns related to this type of
 
05:17:53.548 --> 05:17:53.558 align:start position:0%
legislation and um as legislators
 
05:17:55.390 --> 05:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
whenever that comes into play we we
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
should um be mindful and take note and
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
like um representative Jama said that I
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
feel that this this goes a step too far
 
05:18:09.270 --> 05:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
so I will be supporting the um motion of
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate further
 
05:18:14.310 --> 05:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair I found
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
myself wondering as I thought about this
 
05:18:22.270 --> 05:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
bill what other classes of
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
people cannot sue a municipality if they
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
have been harmed by that municipality
 
05:18:30.670 --> 05:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me that at the end of
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:41.670 --> 05:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion before us is
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%

05:20:57.440 --> 05:21:00.270 align:start position:0%
I have a
second

05:21:00.270 --> 05:21:00.280 align:start position:0%

247 L which does a process to uh get
 
05:21:16.750 --> 05:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
approved for the horse racing and I
 
05:21:18.750 --> 05:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
think should consideration be given if
 
05:21:22.470 --> 05:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
once a company does that spends $100,000
 
05:21:24.628 --> 05:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
a million dollars putting up Casino
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
there should be some safe check or
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
specific guidelines how that license
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
could be
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%

house bills
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
668 FN local is inexpedient to legislate
 
05:23:04.990 --> 05:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
that bill will need to go onto the
 
05:23:06.670 --> 05:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
regular calendar because that is a
 
05:23:10.548 --> 05:23:10.558 align:start position:0%

10th SEC um that's will be for executive
 
05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
sessions only and not notably this date
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
will become official once it's been
 
05:24:14.310 --> 05:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled and publicly noticed which I
 
05:24:17.110 --> 05:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
plan to do by noon on
 
05:24:19.390 --> 05:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
Wednesday uh representative State I have
 
05:24:20.670 --> 05:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
a few more announcements but did you
 
05:24:23.788 --> 05:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
have something okay um additionally
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
committee reports are due um for me by
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
noon to the committee uh services staff
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
so while I know that that is not does
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
not give everybody 48 Hours exactly if
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
at all possible if you could get your
 
05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee reports to me so that I could
 
05:24:46.590 --> 05:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
submit that that would be um much
 
05:24:49.510 --> 05:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
appreciated and okay one other thing
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
with regards to amendments so I would
 
05:24:55.788 --> 05:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
kindly ask as a reminder if you plan to
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
request an amendment from OS please let
 
05:25:03.670 --> 05:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
me know before you um make that request
 
05:25:07.230 --> 05:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
not after and the reason I specify that
 
05:25:10.670 --> 05:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
is because there may be other members of
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
this committee who have the same
 
05:25:17.470 --> 05:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
idea and so um I just want to make sure
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
that we're not um submitting the same
 
05:25:23.788 --> 05:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
amendments and utilizing the resources
 
05:25:27.510 --> 05:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
of OLS so those are the only
 
05:25:29.310 --> 05:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
announcements that I have and
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative stavis did you have a
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
question or later any other
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions okay well seeing none the
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%

05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
