00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh just keeping it
 
00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh just keeping it
brief

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
brief
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to be able to go over
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
just a little background of the
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
technology involved in 5g so we get a
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
slight understanding of what we're
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
talking about here i know some of you
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
have been doing research so have we so
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
we'll cover that a little bit
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
and also is my desire that we want to
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
come up with a
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
a bill that
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
both acknowledges the public's plight at
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
the same time acknowledging the
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
types of evidence that is out there or
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
lack thereof and to come up with an
 
00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.189 align:start position:0%
lack thereof and to come up with an
amenable

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
amenable
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill that would
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
be able to bring attention to
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
the issue in terms of maybe
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
less than what the bill is saying but
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
but also saying that we want to be
 
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.870 align:start position:0%
but also saying that we want to be
careful

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
careful
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
on on what and where we do these things
 
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.469 align:start position:0%
on on what and where we do these things
so

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
at the at this working group
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to come up with some
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
issues and words that we can put there
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
that can kind of
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
call attention at the same time
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that some people do
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
have issues and we just need to to
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thomas so
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a question
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we were discussing continuing the
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
hearings on this particular bill at a
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
later date at the last session and
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
it will not be possible to hear
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
any additional testimony prior to the
 
00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.869 align:start position:0%
any additional testimony prior to the
subcommittee

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.070 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
um

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
i think we do what we need to do
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
but are you planning on additional
 
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.469 align:start position:0%
but are you planning on additional
hearings

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
at this point you know i had forgotten
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
that we had recessed that hearing and we
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
really should complete the hearing
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
before we have an executive session
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
so it's entirely possible that uh i will
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
schedule the last hour of the public
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
hearing at one o'clock on monday the 7th
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then we'll start the executive
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
session at 2 o'clock
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's the
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
the only solution that we can offer
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the the subcommittee will have to do
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
its work prior to that
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
even though we won't hear the we've
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
heard enough testimony i believe on that
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
bill two and a half hours that i think
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee can do its its work i
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
have confidence in that and thank you
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
for your answer okay thank you all right
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
any additional questions uh
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative nader
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
did you say the names of the uh
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
representatives who will be on the
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i did but to review they
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
are representative thomas will chair the
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
i would like now to
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on house bill

okay
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
i forgot the pledge so we're going to do
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
the pledge first then we're going to
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on hb 1459
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
everybody please rise
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
and join representative john lewicki who
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
my apologies for overlooking the pledge
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
i usually like to do that as the very
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
first item of business
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay so now we can move on with the
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing to house bill 1459 fn
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
relative to recycling solar panels
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i would like to
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
turn the floor over to the

thank you for your indulgence listening
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
to my testimony
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
this bill established as a program and

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
adopted in the state of washington
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
chapter 70.355 rcw
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
as of may 2020 hawaii had pending
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that would require
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%

rhode island has considered legislation
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
that if enacted would create a pv module
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer stewardship and take back
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
program so this is certainly not
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
restricted to new hampshire this idea
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
in most cases most states the

of the materials in a solar panel are
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
recyclable or reusable but the heavy
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
metals are a concern
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the panels also have adhesives and
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
sealants to make breaking them apart
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
challenging solar panels are complicated
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
to recycle
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
most solar panel recyclers can
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
mechanically recover the layers of glass

they make them make it inherently
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to use a term d manufacturers

2025.
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
the installations are rapidly
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
proliferating and that means there will
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
be a lot of solar panels heading for the
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
scrap pile
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
panels may have an economic life of 15
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
or to 30 years or less
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
some installed early in the period of
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
solar growth may be headed to the scrap
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
heap already
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
decommissioned pv modules could total 1

e-waste
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
what is the solar panels used for life
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
just like a lot of other other equipment
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
solar panels don't perform at 100 for
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
their entire life and then just stop
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
working in your 30.
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
instead solar panels are very slow rate
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
produce less electricity as they age
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
this process is called degradation
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
because of solar panel degradation most
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
panels production warranties changes
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
they age manufacturers typically
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
guarantee 90 percent of the panel's
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
production until
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
for the first 10 years
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
after 10 years that percentage drops
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
back to 80 for the remaining 15 to 20
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
years after the system's used for life
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
the panel can go
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
panels can go on producing electricity
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
but at a diminished rate so economics
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
may dictate replacement with new panels
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
especially if new solar panels become
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
more efficient and cheaper
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is an incipient problem and getting
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
ahead of it as this bill does saves
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
precious landfill space and major costs
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%

and it's in the testimony so you can
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
key it in the difference between solar
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
panels and other power production is
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
that solar panels are dispersed through
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
a large area each being a relatively
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%

other hand in conclusion this bill
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
anticipates a problem will certainly
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
come about without addressing it several
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
states have already done so i'm open for
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plett before i
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
open the floor to questions on this bill
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
i would like to remind everyone in the
 
00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.030 align:start position:0%
i would like to remind everyone in the

and fred you can submit yours later you
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it right this minute
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay so with that we'll
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
open the floor to questions and uh i see
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative callie fitz has a
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.310 align:start position:0%
representative callie fitz has a
question

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question the
 
00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.230 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question the
uh

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.269 align:start position:0%
uh
this

00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
this wants to set up a fund
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes now
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
thinking straight
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
who would get the benefit of this fund
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer the persons who install
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
the i'm thinking that these are for
 
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.389 align:start position:0%
the i'm thinking that these are for
homeowners

00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's for anybody uh who has a solar
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
system that needs to come down so that
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
the cost of removal is removed from the
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
burden from the homeowner or
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
business and is put on the manufacturer
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
follow up my follow-up would be if this
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
fund it becomes
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
available and the manufacturer is no
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
longer available
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
then what happens they have to feed they
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
have to put money into the fund so it
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference whether
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
they're available or not
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
so so this is the
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
solar panels are installed they fund
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mcgee has
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman before you begin
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee let me just remind

thank you for taking my question
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative plutt um i applaud you
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
for bringing this i think it's it's
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
definitely true that we need to be
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
paying more attention to our our solid
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
waste streams and how we're dealing with
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
technical uh you know uh
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
mechanical waste obviously and uh and
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
anything that can be leaching into the
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
system as you mentioned in your
 
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.110 align:start position:0%
system as you mentioned in your
testimony

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
my question is whether you have talked
 
00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:18.870 align:start position:0%
my question is whether you have talked
with

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the waste management group at des about
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
this because i actually
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored a bill also about waste a
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
bottle bill this this term
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
and i think we have sort of a larger
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
problem with how we're managing all of
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
it and i was wondering if they might be
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
brought in because they do have a waste
 
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.110 align:start position:0%
brought in because they do have a waste
management

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
group or you know some individuals that
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
are dedicated to how new hampshire is
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
doing waste management
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
and in fact i did they've reviewed the
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill they're not taking a position on it
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
but they thought it was uh the person i
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
thought it was well written but not
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
taking a position i agree
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
thanks um so the other thing i would ask
 
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.710 align:start position:0%
thanks um so the other thing i would ask
about

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
the position of
 
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.350 align:start position:0%
the position of
providing

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the extra cost on the manufacturer up
 
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.310 align:start position:0%
the extra cost on the manufacturer up
front

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
front
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
and whether you have found any
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
indication that that would be a
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
disincentive for people to
 
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.870 align:start position:0%
disincentive for people to
to

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
to
supply

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
supply
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
solar panels in the state of new
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire like do you think it would
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
inhibit inhibit them from doing business
 
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.310 align:start position:0%
inhibit inhibit them from doing business
here

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
if so
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
we need to take care of the problem at
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
hand which is to which is to take care
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
of the waste stream if that's a
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
disincentive that's not the intention
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a part of the total cost
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.950 align:start position:0%
of the
product

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mcgee
 
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.310 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mcgee
um

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
i have a question representative plett
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
is the
overriding

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
overriding
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of this legislation
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
our cities and towns
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
from future costs of handling this waste
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
themselves which would be a burden to
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
taxpayers absolutely either the cities
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
and towns and filling up landfills but
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
also homeowners and businesses that may
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
be stuck with some of that cost
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mcwilliams
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairvoz and thank you
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative plett for the
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
presentation i think that this is
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly timely because we've been
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
talking about land filling materials and
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
landfills filling up in new hampshire
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
this last legislative session and so
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is really helpful to see a stance
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
on solar panels so thank you for your
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
research and drafting this
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
i currently have a bill regarding
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
construction waste and debris um and
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
mandating that it be diverted from our
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
waste stream so it doesn't end up in
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
landfills um
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so i'm curious if you could see this
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
working for construction debris as well
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
as solar panels
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly have no pride of authorship
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
in fact the
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
the words came from washington state
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
modified by our ols so if you see some
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
way to tweak the wording for
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
construction debris go have at it i i
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
will say in my town anyway we do divert
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
construction debris and it goes to a
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
separate processing facility so it
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't go into landfill some of it
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
eventually does but a lot of it is
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
recycled yeah okay um that's great and
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
then the second piece follow up
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
the second piece is same question for
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
the automotive industry could you see
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
this applying to cars and sale of cars
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh possibly i i think that the cars
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
already have a robust recycling process
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
because there's value in the metals and
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
because there's such value in the metals
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
a program like this may not be necessary
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
because there's enough residual values
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
to to make the recycling worth
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
the candle so
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
but that wouldn't be true thank you
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative mcwilliams
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
thomas is recognized
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
how do you see this bill interacting or
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
how would it act with um
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
say homeowners
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
for instance that are leasing solars
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
versus ones that that own them
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
if a homeowner leases the system the
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
homeowner should have no obligation on a
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
financial obligation to remove it but
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
the least less sore will have that
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
obligation and if the lessor happens to
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
be the manufacturer problem solved
 
00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:24.789 align:start position:0%
be the manufacturer problem solved
but

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
if it's a third party
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
this bill would provide some financial
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
relief to that lessor
 
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.390 align:start position:0%
relief to that lessor
follow-up

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for the follow-up
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
question uh on a different note
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
would this bill apply to
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
any solar panels that are put on any of
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
our federal buildings in the state
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
airport and so forth
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
i hadn't thought through that but i
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't see why not a solar panel is a
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
solar panel
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
you aren't representative thomas i went
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
through my two questions i know i and i
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
thanked you for those two
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative samsung is
 
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.270 align:start position:0%
okay representative samsung is
recognized

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
represent platt for bringing this bill
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i too applaud you for this idea
 
00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:18.789 align:start position:0%
and i too applaud you for this idea
because

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
it is important for us to hold
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturers accountable for what they
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
make and how it's disposed of
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
why does this not apply to all
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
electronic waste
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
smartphones computers laptops it's the
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
same technology and often the materials
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
involved are significantly more than in
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
so they need to be disposed of as
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
e-waste in many municipalities like ours
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me this would be
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
why why can't we just put solar panels
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the same boat with e-waste a good
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you for the question i
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
think the difference is scale
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
in my town there is e-waste recycling
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i have to pay for it i may pay
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars for a tv or ten dollar
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars for
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
uh small electronics uh and so it is
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.029 align:start position:0%
taken care of
and

00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
this program may be a little too
 
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.470 align:start position:0%
this program may be a little too
cumbersome

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
for small electronics like that but it
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
is being taken care of town by town
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
so it's not been going to the waste
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
not going into the waste
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm aware of disassembling plants
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
in in europe now that are doing this
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
regularly with solar panels
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh it's it's becoming a big
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
industry there because manufacturers are
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for doing exactly what
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
you're proposing here
 
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.510 align:start position:0%
you're proposing here
however

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're proposing here a state
 
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're proposing here a state
program

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh why not let municipalities uh do the
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
same thing that they do now collect a
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
fee from
 
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.750 align:start position:0%
fee from
the

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
user of a solar panel when it gets
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
brought to your landfill
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh why why would we need a separate
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
state program for this
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
well i think it's the potential cost
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
involved in recycling
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
and the cost it would be imposed on on
 
00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
and the cost it would be imposed on on
the

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
person or business who has that solar
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a 20 tv it's something
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
much bigger than that that's why this i
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
think this program is necessary
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsic
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative mann is recognized for a
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
question turn sideways a little bit
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this is just a
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
crazy thought um
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be interesting to have uh i
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
i need to upgrade my solar panels i mean
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
might have been on my roof for quite a
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
while and they don't produce
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
what i really want i could really
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
increase it could we put the burden on
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
whoever is selling new panels
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
that was going to replace my panels on
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
my roof
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
put the burden on them to recycle the
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
ones that they remove
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's and um sorry if you weren't
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
done there's a way you know that would
 
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
done there's a way you know that would
be

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
instead of giving me discounts on the
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
price of the solar they would compete on
 
00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.269 align:start position:0%
price of the solar they would compete on
uh

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
being able to recycle cheaply
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know the business would be motivated
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
actually to
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
to uh to recycle in order to sell
 
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.269 align:start position:0%
to uh to recycle in order to sell
upgrades

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
upgrades
 
00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
upgrades
i'm

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
i don't quite speak english but uh is
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
that is that an interesting idea and
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
do you think that would work
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
you speak english very well i did
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
understand the question thank you
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative man
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
um that's something for you to negotiate
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh with a new installer to see if you
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
can pull it off but unfortunately the
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
person putting in the new solar panel
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
isn't responsible necessarily for the
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer cost of the old solar panel
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
but that's something you could certainly
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
negotiate right
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up representative matt
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative white is
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
have you looked into
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
excuse me how this would affect the cost
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
of a solar system
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
i really don't know
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
but the state washington state doesn't
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
seem to have slowed down solar
 
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.430 align:start position:0%
seem to have slowed down solar
installations

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
installations
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative partial is recognized
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
thank you chair votes and thank you uh
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
representative platt for your wonderful
 
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
representative platt for your wonderful
testimony

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me what we're speaking of
 
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.029 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me what we're speaking of
here

00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
um well first let me say i wish we had
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
this kind of foresight before adoption
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
of some other technology such as our
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
nuclear industry of how we dispose of
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
the ensuing waste
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be what we're talking
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
about is an extended producer
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility bill such as washington
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
state just enacted
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
um it plays the end of product liability
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
back onto the manufacturer and not to
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or consumers so i'm all for
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
this bill in theory
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
are you aware of h house bill one one
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
one one which addresses these same
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
issues broadly for all solid waste right
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
i am not and frankly i don't go around
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
remembering house bill numbers in my
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
head uh so so
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
i do i do if if i'm familiar with the
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill i remember it by its content not by
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
its number but no i'm not okay i
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
understand that and i would have the
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
same problem
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
i will say with respect i will say with
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
respect to nuclear power there is a
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
whole program federally imposed for
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
decommissioning of the plants and
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's a federal program the federal
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
government hasn't lived up for handling
 
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.230 align:start position:0%
government hasn't lived up for handling
the

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the waste so so i do think that has been
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
taken care of
um

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative partial is behind
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up please in case you're trying
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't worry about it um i would love to
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
talk about the what you brought up this
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
now i first mentioned nuclear so pardon
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
me maybe that cloudy issue let me take
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
that back then
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
um but would you support a broader
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
approach that addresses electronics and
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
batteries and all these other products
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with right now for
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
disposal and create more extender
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
more producer liability on these end
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
life products that's a good question and
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
the answer is maybe
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason the word maybe is because
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
this program may be too big a hammer for
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
the problem at hand on the other hand i
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
do see this extending to uh central
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
station batteries uh
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
the the uh and automotive batteries i
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
could see it extending to when we have a
 
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
could see it extending to when we have a
viable

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
viable
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
electric car industry that's going to be
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of batteries that need
 
00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:13.669 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of batteries that need
recycling

00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for
 
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.950 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for
answers

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.990 align:start position:0%
answers
okay

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
notter is recognized
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman may i ask a
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
question of representative mann
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
at this time uh that's not typically the
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
way we do things if that gets me off the
 
00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:32.070 align:start position:0%
way we do things if that gets me off the
stand

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
stand
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
if that gets me off the stand i'm all
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you could do that offline
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if the questions that have
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
come up and there's a lot of questions
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:55.110 align:start position:0%
 
previous

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
dealings with recycling and how
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
some of the countries are not doing that
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
anymore and how it's very difficult to
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
do it and
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
be amenable to making this a study to
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
look into the cost issues to how they'd
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
be handled who would handle them
 
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.430 align:start position:0%
be handled who would handle them
and

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
instead of just going forward and saying
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
without all or a lot of the details in
 
00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:25.350 align:start position:0%
without all or a lot of the details in
place

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
if that is the
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
will of the committee i could i
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't fight that but i
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
think it has been put in place in
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
washington state
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it has worked so i'm not sure a
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up one follow-up
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
do we have the details or any of the
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
details from washington state and is
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
this the exact verbiage
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much the exact verbiage of
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
washington state uh it's
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
of course modified to new hampshire so
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
they had a depart a division we don't
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
have so in our cases environmental
 
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.789 align:start position:0%
have so in our cases environmental
services

00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
services
so

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
the the agency names have changed but
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's essentially
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
exact verbiage
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pimentel is
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you representative
 
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.509 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you representative
plett

00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
plett
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking this on i
 
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:21.990 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking this on i
appreciate

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
any recycling that we can do
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
as a country
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
products that
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
basically when they get replaced
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
there is a fee attached to them things
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
like tires
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
which pays for the proper disposal
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
of the one that was just removed
 
00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:47.909 align:start position:0%
of the one that was just removed
um

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's inst i don't know if it's a
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
federal law or
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
a state law but wouldn't that be a
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
simpler way of dealing with panels so
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
that when they're actually removed
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh there would be a fee attached for
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
uh interesting question thank you
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel and and the
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
concern i have is the size of the fee to
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
cover the cost it's one thing when
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a small radio or tv
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
or a tire
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
but it's another thing when you're
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with the massive amount of
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
panels that need recycling so that fee
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
might be exorbitant so the whole purpose
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to shift that cost to the
 
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.110 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to shift that cost to the
manufacturer

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
do you need a follow-up
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman but
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
whether we pay before or after
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we still be paying
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a cost imposed on the
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturer up front because of this
 
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.470 align:start position:0%
manufacturer up front because of this
bill

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
i certainly would think that the
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer would try to build that
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
into the upfront cost of the panel
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
maybe but competition might keep that
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
from happening so i can't answer the
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
but it's it's true that some of those
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
costs the the homeowner may be paying
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
one way or another but but i can't say
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
that all of those costs are passed on to
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
the homeowner or business some of them
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
may be absorbed through competitive
 
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.790 align:start position:0%
may be absorbed through competitive
pressures

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative um
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
the wiki is recognized for a question
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
give us the chairman uh thank you
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative um i see us going all
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
over the map here talking about
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
automotive waste and so forth and
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be better to stick with
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
the subject i know that well perhaps as
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
a question are you aware of the program
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
where the autopsy stores will take a
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
battery no questions asked and give you
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
a ten dollar credit
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
have done that myself but i'm not sure
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
what that gets what's that got to do
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn your mic back on
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
when you speak okay um no but thank you
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's just that we seem to be all over
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
the map we're talking about electronic
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
waste automotive waste and so forth and
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
we've got one specific thing and i think
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
it might be better to concentrate
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm just looking at the fiscal note
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it the last sentence says it should
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
be noted the bill uh provides neither an
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation nor authority for the
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
establishment of the new position that
 
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.150 align:start position:0%
establishment of the new position that
it

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
it discusses
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
us needing in order to sort of
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
administer having a program like this so
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if you had any
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
thoughts about whether
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
we we might need to define an
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the state to be able
 
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the state to be able
to

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
implement the program
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
my answer is that this will go to the uh
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee from it is if it's a
 
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.870 align:start position:0%
finance committee from it is if it's a
fn

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
fn
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
um and the reason why it's not uh
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
funding if funding isn't identified
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
above is because it says it's in uh
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and 25 and so they'll
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
have to maybe give that
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
at least note that so when it before
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
implementation it is approved by the
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.109 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
any uh additional questions
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
i have an additional question
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
since it's likely that when a solar
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
system comes to the end of its life it's
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
not just one panel
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
would the cost of disposing of those
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
solar panels be quite high
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.510 align:start position:0%
solar panels be quite high
and

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
should there be some kind of a an
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
arrangement such as the one you propose
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
to make that cost
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
less difficult for the person who's
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
recycling his panels to accomplish
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for the question i
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
think that's the whole purpose of the
 
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
think that's the whole purpose of the
bill

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
is to is to remove is to shift cost
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
burden from the homeowner or business to
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the manufacturer
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
and provide a program for safe recycling
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
i will say that in many cases
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
solar panels can go a long time before
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
they in fact do need to be scrapped or
 
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.750 align:start position:0%
they in fact do need to be scrapped or
recycled

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
recycled
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
even though with lesser output they may
 
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.550 align:start position:0%
even though with lesser output they may
find

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
a use with that lesser output but
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
eventually they'll have to be scrapped
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what this program is about
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay my follow-up question then is
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
let's say i buy solar panels for my
 
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.069 align:start position:0%
let's say i buy solar panels for my
house

00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
but then i sell my house
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
and the sec the owner who owns the house
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
after me
 
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.109 align:start position:0%
after me
after

00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
say 20 years decides he needs to replace
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
those solar panels
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
would he get hit with uh additional fees
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
when he goes to do that recycling the in
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
my view of this bill with the bill
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
that the homeowner he or she
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
can go to the
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
des and get get the cost of removal
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
covered without the bill yes they'll be
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
stuck with costs
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
for representative plett oh
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
did i miss you representative partial go
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
ahead yes thank you chair that's one
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
more quick question
 
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.510 align:start position:0%
more quick question
um

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
i i do like this bill very much and i
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
really think it's a time that we stop
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
passing hidden costs along to the
 
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
passing hidden costs along to the
consumers

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
my only concern is that this product
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
maybe should be addressing some of these
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
other issues that have been said are
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
tangential i mean it's i feel it does
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
single out the solar panel industry
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
when there's
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
other industries that would benefit from
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
the same approach of uh extended
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to hear your comment on
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
that if i may okay i'm going to use a
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
word i invented i'm dealing with a son
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
who's been seven through seven years of
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
bad health
 
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
he's been struggling to get along to a a
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
a a healthy uh state and he's close
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
but he's having to do the same thing
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
over and over and over every day so he
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
invented the word of the
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
one foot in front of the other
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
and so let's get this one passed and i
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
may very well come back next year with
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
something to extend it to uh central
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
station and automotive batteries in in
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
electric cars
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
and about one foot in front of the other
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
and see where the need is
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay follow up then yeah follow up do
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
you think we could get more of an uh
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
economy of scale if we did take the
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
entire problems on square you know uh
 
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.870 align:start position:0%
entire problems on square you know uh
uh

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
what's you know that's rather than
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
sail right towards the enemy as it were
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
um do you think we get more accomplished
 
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.430 align:start position:0%
um do you think we get more accomplished
by

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.550 align:start position:0%
by
um

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
addressing multiple issues with the same
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
kind of uh approach you're taking here
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
which i think is a good approach
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
and my answer is possibly
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm not expert enough uh and so it'd
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
have to involve des and others in in
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
that discussion and my afraid of putting
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
too many uh bulbs on the christmas tree
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
is that the christmas tree might fall
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
over that we will let's get something
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
passed and then grow from there sure
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for those answers
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
good analogy about the christmas tree
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
you may have noticed uh members of the
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee that i have uh my excuse
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
not yet not yet
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
i have allowed more than the two
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
question per member limit
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
so far in this discussion
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i have done that on purpose because
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
i have scheduled this hearing for two
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
hours in anticipation that there would
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
be a lot of discussion i think a robust
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
discussion of this issue
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
is worthwhile
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
and as a result i've decided to waive
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
our requirement that each member be
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
limited to two questions
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
because i only have one other pink card
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's been submitted
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
for testimony on this bill so we have
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
plenty of time
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
so if any of you were wondering about
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason i have done that
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
so i will allow some additional
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
questions since we do have time
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative samsic indicated that he
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.829 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman and thank you
representative

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
i want to underscore the idea that we
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
need we should take a more comprehensive
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
view of all this waste because
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned solar panels have a
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
lifetime of a life
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
a long life of 20 years more more
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
but cell phones
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
laptops computers
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
three four years
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
and they're piling up like crazy in our
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
landfill and not landfills but in our
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
recycling centers
 
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.670 align:start position:0%
recycling centers
and

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
the materials in there are both more
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
valuable and more toxic than anything in
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
a solar panel
 
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
a solar panel
so

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the one one hand it's good to deal
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
with this but this is a problem that
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
right now in new hampshire especially
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
where we have so little solar energy
 
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.190 align:start position:0%
where we have so little solar energy
installed

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
installed
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
we probably have 20 years before we have
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
any significant amount of panels to to
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
let landfill or dispose of
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
versus every three years everyone's
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
getting a new cell phone everyone's
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
getting a new laptop
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
those are all the same type of
 
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.349 align:start position:0%
those are all the same type of
technologies

00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
and with many more valuable materials
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
and many more toxic materials included
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
compared to a solar panel
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me if we're going to make
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
some rules and and set up a fund
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
for disposal of these materials for
 
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.950 align:start position:0%
for disposal of these materials for
solar

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
solar
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
it would make a lot of sense to include
 
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
it would make a lot of sense to include
the

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
the other technologies and waste that's
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
very typical of this this type of
 
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.349 align:start position:0%
very typical of this this type of
technology

00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill as well because
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
already causing a problem whereas the
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
solar panel waste is going to be
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
several years before we see significance
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
don't you think we should include that
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
as well considering the lifetime of
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think i addressed that with earlier
 
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.069 align:start position:0%
i think i addressed that with earlier
questions

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a matter of scale
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the cell phones
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so on do have a
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
recycling process so you find boxes to
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
put them in in towns they have places to
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
put them and they are being recycled and
 
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
put them and they are being recycled and
and

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
this sort of bill may be a little too
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for something that small
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
but but which are being addressed anyway
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
but i i'm open uh if there's some future
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
date let's see if we can't get something
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
passed and build on it
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing that solar panels
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
are in a different category in my
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
opinion on some of the other
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
equipment that was mentioned because
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
they are big time producers of
 
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.589 align:start position:0%
they are big time producers of
electricity

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a cell phone so i think
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
they might fall into a special case but
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
i was wondering
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
have you received any feedback at all
 
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.309 align:start position:0%
have you received any feedback at all
from

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
anybody here in the state
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the solar panel industry on your bill
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
or any suggestions thereof
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
i would have thought that this bill
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
would have attracted huge attention so
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just kind of curious if anyone has
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
spoken to you about it at all i'd be
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
curious to know what their thoughts are
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
on that the only people who've spoken to
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
me at all on this bill
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
are from des
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh when
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
michael wimsat and i forget the
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
young man working for him have reviewed
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill i've not gotten any uh
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
feedback from anybody in the solar
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
industry or anywhere else except uh
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
articles newspaper uh
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
articles that were posted which were not
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
complementary from some of the solar
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
industry but have not seen anything
 
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:18.470 align:start position:0%
industry but have not seen anything
directly

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.710 align:start position:0%
directly
follow-up

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
i'll do a follow-up thank you mr chair
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up so uh
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
michael north i'm sorry
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
the the the article you mentioned the
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
articles you mentioned in in the paper
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
we're not directed solely at you
 
00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
we're not directed solely at you
so

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
i can can would you assume
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
say for that article that there's not a
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
whole lot of
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
concern on this bill from the solar
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
industry since no one has talked to you
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
or is here to testify i've learned not
 
00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:53.990 align:start position:0%
or is here to testify i've learned not
to

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
attribute motives or to anybody else
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
that i can only say i introduced this
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill i've had no feedback and you can
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
read however you wish it to read
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.390 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
recognized

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
sorry fred my mind is working a little
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
slow today
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh i'm thinking
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
that not the majority of solar panels
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
are not manufactured in the united
 
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
are not manufactured in the united
states

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of distribution i see
 
00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:28.630 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of distribution i see
installers

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
installers
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't
 
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.270 align:start position:0%
but i don't
know

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
what the percentages of
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
manufactured panels in the us
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
am i correct in my assumption that most
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the panels come from overseas and my
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know what's the litigation process
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
or what's the process of forcing
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
a country or an another
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer in a different country
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
to contribute to a fund so those were
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
two questions ahead well my
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is they have to contribute
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
up front so they want to sell their
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
panel they'll have to contribute uh and
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
and like my concern
 
00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:12.790 align:start position:0%
and like my concern
uh

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
is if the moral manufacturing were in
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
the united states you're right a lot of
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
it's from china i think the uh the view
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
of solar panels may be somewhat
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
different because there's a lot of
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
mining of stuff
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
and we won't tolerate it but china it's
 
00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:31.270 align:start position:0%
and we won't tolerate it but china it's
okay

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.910 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
pimentel

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of other
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
areas of the world like the eu
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other countries
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
have within their borders
 
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.390 align:start position:0%
have within their borders
um

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
essentially stuff what we're talking
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
about with this bill where there is a
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory recycling of these panels
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from uh
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative sanchez
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
break down these
 
00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:18.710 align:start position:0%
break down these
panels

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
panels
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
and actually recycle 95 of what
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's it doesn't seem to fit an economy
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
of scale
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i also
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if that is going to
 
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.829 align:start position:0%
wonder if that is going to
affect

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
solarized so to speak
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
compared to the rest of new england and
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that was i'm sure i
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
understand the question what i heard out
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
of something that i think i've answered
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
previously what the impact might be on
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
the solar industry and uh the amount of
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
installation and my answer was it's this
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate cost and if it slows it
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
down that's a side effect that's not the
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
intent but we have to take care of the
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
problem of a waste stream so keep it out
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
transfer station out of the landfills
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
and keep heavy metals from polluting our
 
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.750 align:start position:0%
and keep heavy metals from polluting our
ground

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.790 align:start position:0%
ground
our

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh our uh atmosphere so if that if this
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
has a chilling effect that's not the
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
purpose but my answer is so what it's
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up representative
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
no thanks thank you miss uh rep
 
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
no thanks thank you miss uh rep
uh

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
i i kind of wanted to um
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
underscore what
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
the previous representative just
 
00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.870 align:start position:0%
the previous representative just
mentioned

00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
if this program were to be set up
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
where actually would the disassemble
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
wing of the panels happen
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
who would do this who would take these
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
panels to recover them to recycle them
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i say this because
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned before since 2018 the
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
very first disassembling plant in europe
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
in france has been set up
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
very impressive
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh highly robotic they can disassemble
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
and recover materials from one solar
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
panel within five minutes and it creates
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
huge economic stimulus for jobs for
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
technology and all that stuff which
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
would be great if we if new hampshire
 
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.030 align:start position:0%
would be great if we if new hampshire
became

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
became
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
a disassembler of solar panels as an
 
00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:53.270 align:start position:0%
a disassembler of solar panels as an
industry

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
however as was just mentioned we have so
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
little right now in this state and we're
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
such a small scale state
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh that i don't see us getting involved
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
in this issue uh proactively
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative samsich so you'll recall
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
that uh yeah two weeks ago we talked
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
about not making speeches sorry about
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
that okay mr chairman you have a
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
question to extract some information i
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
think there was a question
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that we create
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
disassembling facilities in new
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire no
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
if that happened i'd be all for it but
 
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
if that happened i'd be all for it but
but

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's a role for government the role
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
for government is bills like this the
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
role for government isn't to create
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing let it happen and if you
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
look if you look
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
on the web and as i said on my testimony
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
there were several it's a nascent
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
industry the recycling industry but
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
there were several set up across the
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
country to do just this
 
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.069 align:start position:0%
country to do just this
and

00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
so if that happens in new hampshire fine
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't find as long as it's taken
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
care of and
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
who i don't know but there's several out
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
there to go to
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative flett i
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
detect that the questions are starting
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
to get repetitive
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to thank you for your
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
and we're going to move on to our next
 
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.069 align:start position:0%
and we're going to move on to our next
presenter

00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
presenter
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to call on sam evans brown
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
representing clean energy new hampshire
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you to the
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is sam evans brown i'm
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
the executive director of clean energy
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
we are a small non-profit policy
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
that represents individuals and
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state of new
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are interested
 
00:52:57.599 --> 00:52:58.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are interested
in

00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
the state having good policies to
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
encourage a transition to clean energy
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh indeed many of our business members
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
do include representatives of the the
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
solar installer uh workforce that would
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
be impacted by this bill
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
and and we have some concerns
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
we would be very open to working with
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative plett to uh to address
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
those concerns because the solar
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
industry writ large i think is very
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
interested in answering this question of
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the life of these solar
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
panels i think the feeling is just that
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps as as representative platt
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
himself said that this is a rather large
 
00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:39.510 align:start position:0%
himself said that this is a rather large
hammer

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
hammer
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
when when the problem has yet to yet to
 
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.990 align:start position:0%
when when the problem has yet to yet to
materialize

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
materialize
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
um i think if you that just sort of to
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
pull back a bit if you look around
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
yourself right now we're surrounded by
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
all sorts of goods uh you know tables
 
00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:55.670 align:start position:0%
all sorts of goods uh you know tables
carpets

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
carpets
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
light bulbs cars
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
all of which are allowed to be built and
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
sold to consumers without any sort of
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
stewardship plan
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that determines what will happen to
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
them at the end of their life
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
and and solar panels while they are
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
quite large do have a long life uh in
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
fact the the the length of service of
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
the solar panel is somewhat
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
indeterminate there was a great article
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the concord monitor a number of years
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
ago where the author tried to track down
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
the oldest solar panel in the state and
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
found one that was 40 years old and
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
still producing power
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
you know the lifespan that was cited in
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the representatives testimony
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
was perhaps a bit on the short side and
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
and uh i would highlight the fact that
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
there is in fact an a an nrel study from
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
the national renewable energy laboratory
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
that talks about the thriving salvage
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
market for panels that are pulled off
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
the pulled out of installations um so it
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
is not clear that after the the you know
 
00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.030 align:start position:0%
is not clear that after the the you know
warranty

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
warranty
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
service life of 25 years that solar
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
panels will immediately go into into the
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
landfill um and as several
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
representatives have pointed out there
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
will be a large volume of solar panels
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming out of service you know
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
several decades from now and and i think
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's the opportunity to let the
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
private market step up and uh provide
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
the service of recycling those panels
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
that that we allow the private market to
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
do for all of the other consumer goods
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
that surround you here today
 
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.789 align:start position:0%
that surround you here today
um

00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think you know representative ple
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
cited that by 2030 we might have a
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
million tons of solar panels going into
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
solar panels very briefly i googled what
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of the american waste stream
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
that would represent that would be less
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
than one percent of the american waste
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
stream assuming and that's assuming that
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
every solar panel that was taken out of
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
service was immediately landfilled as
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh sold into the salvage
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
market or recycled for for parts um as
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
as is done today in fact uh we we uh in
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
our testimony cite the the
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
decommissioning plan of the fitzwilliam
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
solar site the chinook uh solar array
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
that was the 30 megawatt array that was
 
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.549 align:start position:0%
that was the 30 megawatt array that was
built

00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:05.109 align:start position:0%
built
was

00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
approved by the site evaluation
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
committee a few years ago and they have
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
a very robust decommissioning plan
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's built into that
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
approval that includes the the installer
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
covering the full cost of uh returning
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
the site to pre-construction condition
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
and indicates that not only will all the
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
solar panels be recycled but even the
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
the foundations and the chain-link
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
fences will be recycled from that
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
project so again i would i would just
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
highlight that perhaps this is a uh
 
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.950 align:start position:0%
highlight that perhaps this is a uh
a

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
solution that the private market can
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
provide on its own already
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
that said you know when it comes to
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
smaller smaller installations
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
residential installations and municipal
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
installations there is perhaps a role
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
for the state to do something like it
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
does with the recycling of tires um and
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that is something that we we
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
should be thinking about proactively um
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
i would simply
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh ask the question of why
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
why it would be that solar panels which
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
you know in the worst case scenario
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
would represent a tiny fraction of our
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
total solid waste stream should be in
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
this special category uh and with that
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions that the
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr evans brown for your
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
testimony looking for questions now for
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh mr evans brown and i recognize
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative thomas for a question
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you for
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question i
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh first let me preface my comment my
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
question by saying i i
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
am continue continuously frustrated when
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
government is aware of a problem but
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
kicks the can down the road because they
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to deal with it right now
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
it always costs us more later on to fix
 
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
it always costs us more later on to fix
it

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
but in terms of
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
the solar panels
 
00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.270 align:start position:0%
the solar panels
why

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.630 align:start position:0%
why
why

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
they they produce a large amount of
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
electricity they're producers
 
00:57:56.799 --> 00:57:57.750 align:start position:0%
electricity they're producers
and

00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
it i can't
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
believe that in time would do you
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
believe that you know what this is not a
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
do you believe question but but with
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
technology changing all the time
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
if there's not a way to recycle
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
existing solar panels and new technology
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
comes out that the solar industry wants
 
00:58:16.799 --> 00:58:17.910 align:start position:0%
comes out that the solar industry wants
to

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
sell a new improved version of a panel
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
but they can't because people
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
they they don't want to get rid of the
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
old ones but uh if there was a recycling
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
program developed now where they could
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
get rid of their old panels and and buy
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
new improved ones would wouldn't that be
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
helpful for both the the environment
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
recycling and the solar industry if we
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
did if we did develop a program now
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
as a way to to get rid of solar panels
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm not suggesting that the
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
recycling of solar panels is not a good
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
thing and not a desirable outcome that
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
the state should be working towards the
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
question is merely why why would the
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
state feel the need to step in right now
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
and create such a program as opposed to
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
letting the private market step forward
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
and do so itself because there are a lot
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
of indications as representative samsic
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
laid out in the european example in
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
which the private market is going to do
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
exactly that um and and so you know
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
when we when we think about an
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
individual homeowner and their their
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
financial decision of of whether to
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
replace some old degraded
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
less efficient panels with newer shinier
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
more efficient ones that's simply an
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
economic decision that that individual
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
homeowner will make
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be based on a number
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
of factors including the salvage value
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
of the panels but also the installation
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
cost of of taking the old ones down and
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
putting the new ones up and so i i i
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
merely ask you know this is
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
your you prefaced your question by
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
saying that you're concerned when the
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
government sees problems and does
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
nothing about them if what we're
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
concerned about here is solid waste
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you to look up the
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
percentage of the various waste streams
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
that go into our landfills and attack
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
that problem and what you'll find is
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of our solid
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
waste the largest tranche is organics
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
right so so we should perhaps develop a
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
composting program what we're concerned
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
about is solid waste
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
but what i'm i'm merely suggesting that
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
this may not actually be a problem the
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
private market may solve this problem
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
no follow-up thank you
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay no follow-up
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
i got a question about
 
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
i got a question about
if

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the alternative which is end
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
of use
 
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.230 align:start position:0%
of use
uh

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
payment for disposal
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
and my question is would wouldn't that
 
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.549 align:start position:0%
and my question is would wouldn't that
encourage

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
the the owner of the panels
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
to either one
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
keep them longer despite
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh that their reduced uh
 
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:03.589 align:start position:0%
uh that their reduced uh
efficiency

01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
and two
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
find an appropriate
 
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.829 align:start position:0%
find an appropriate
place

01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
sell the panels
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
i will confess that i have not given a
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
great deal of thought as to what the
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
impacts of an end of end of life sort of
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
recycling fee a la what we do with tires
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
what type of effect that would have um i
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
think this the suppositions you lay out
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
seem seem reasonable and i think that
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps if if the committee does want to
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
look into
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
alternative language this bill that
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
might be something that we could that we
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
could work on together collaboratively
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor and with the department
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
of environmental services um
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
so so i think uh perhaps would be my
 
01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:53.190 align:start position:0%
so so i think uh perhaps would be my
answer

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and wouldn't you
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm looking at infrastructure as
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
far as
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for setting up the
 
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.630 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for setting up the
pro

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
pro
 
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.430 align:start position:0%
pro
for

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
a program
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
laid out in the bill
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having
 
01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:13.670 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having
um

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of fee
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
at end of use and what what the
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
difference in the infrastructure costs
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the states
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh that that i think is an excellent
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
point in particular when we when i look
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
at this bill uh there is a new position
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
created at the department of
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
environmental services there's not as
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
far as i can tell funding for that
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
position except for what could perhaps
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
be extracted from the manufacturers of
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
representative cali pitts asked earlier
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
about how how many of those
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are in fact in the united
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
states the answer is less than one
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
percent of solar panels are manufactured
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the united states so so there's an
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
enforceability question as to whether
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
the state will be able to get
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to pay into a fund to
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
support a position
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
um so so i i think that if what we're
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
looking for is a solution to the end of
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
life to solar panels
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
something that is perhaps a lighter
 
01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.990 align:start position:0%
something that is perhaps a lighter
touch

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
touch
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
and and doesn't create so much
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as you put it could be it
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
we have a few more questions i have one
 
01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:19.109 align:start position:0%
we have a few more questions i have one
myself

01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in your written testimony
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
that the chinook solar
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
system solar project down in fitzwilliam
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
had a decommissioning plan as part of
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
its original
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
original project plan
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
now that's a solar a utility scale solar
 
01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:40.549 align:start position:0%
now that's a solar a utility scale solar
project

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
and required the site evaluation
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
approve the project and the site
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee of course has rules
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
that require decommissioning
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
plans so my question is what about these
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
small residential solar systems you know
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
5 10 15 solar panels
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
what would you envision as being
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
an appropriate methodology to avoid
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities having to deal with
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
increased costs when a residence tries
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
to dispose of
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
i would i would reiterate what i said in
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
my in the beginning of my testimony
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
which is that this is this is a concern
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to reduce our solid waste
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
stream is something that i think that is
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
in fact an appropriate role for the
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
government um but the question is why
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
why in particular are we concerned about
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
solar panels versus all of the other uh
 
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
solar panels versus all of the other uh
large

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
and recyclable consumer goods that are
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
that are sold each year why are there no
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
stewardship plans for cars as was laid
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
out and the answer is because the
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
private market is allowed to step up and
 
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.430 align:start position:0%
private market is allowed to step up and
and

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
provide solutions to
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
to goods that are still valuable um and
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
am not averse and i think our members
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
are not averse to asking the question of
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
is there some sort of state program that
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
could encourage the recycling of these
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
materials i think that our membership
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
simply feels that the program that is
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
laid out in the bill as written is
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little heavy-handed
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
now what would i personally envision um
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
i would envision that a robust recycling
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
industry would would spring up
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
as the need as the need uh dictates and
 
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
as the need as the need uh dictates and
that

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that a robust recycling
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
industry does not exist right now
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
because there's no need for one and
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a large volume of solar
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
panels that are being decommissioned as
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
of yet
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you following up on that
 
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.549 align:start position:0%
okay thank you following up on that
question

01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
there are municipal municipal plans in
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
place currently to charge people to
 
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.270 align:start position:0%
place currently to charge people to
recycle

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
recycle
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
certain types of of materials for
 
01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.870 align:start position:0%
certain types of of materials for
example

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
in order for me to take a refrigerator
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
to my local municipal
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
transfer station i have to pay a fee
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
and that fee is reasonable it might be
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
as much as 25 but it's it's reasonable
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
but what if the fees to dispose of solar
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
panels were much much higher
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
would that discourage people from taking
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
those solar panels to the transfer
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
station and would we end up with a bunch
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
of disposed solar panels in the woods
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh as that's a hypothetical question um
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
if that scenario were to were to play
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
out um
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
you know i would imagine the state would
 
01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:32.950 align:start position:0%
you know i would imagine the state would
would

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
assess that problem as it started to
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
occur and and deal with it the question
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
is are we looking for a solution without
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
having a problem first
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
now that said
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
i i do feel that the solar industry writ
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
large is serious about this problem and
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
is very open to looking for solutions
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
proactively before the before the
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
problem starts to occur i simply think
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
that we should we should think of a
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
program that is scaled to meet the
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
likelihood that a problem
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
is going to arise
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
and from my in my sort of
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
read having having spent a lot of time
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
paying very close attention to this
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
industry i'm not convinced the problem
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
is going to arise i do think the private
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
industry will step up and provide
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
solutions before a problem comes to pass
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee is
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
following along on this line of
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
questioning and some stuff that's come
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
up already i i think
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
the heavy-handedness or the the
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
fulsomeness of what the bill attempts to
 
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
fulsomeness of what the bill attempts to
do

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh i'll go back to representative kelly
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
pitt's point that she made earlier
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers are not in this
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
country and while business is
 
01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
country and while business is
international

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
international
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
it appears that there's a lot of
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
interaction between
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
the state whoever we put in charge of it
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the state if we hire someone and the
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturer remember no speeches
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
questions well it's based on the bill um
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
so the bill includes in it
 
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.630 align:start position:0%
so the bill includes in it
uh

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
details of how the manufacturer will
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
interact with the state and if and if
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
they don't conform to the things that
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
are in this bill
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
then they would be prohibited from
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
functioning in the state so i guess the
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.709 align:start position:0%
question is
uh

01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have to submit a plan and
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
jump through these hoops and write back
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
and forth and meet all these hurdles
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
does that convolute their ability to
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
work in the state or does it you know
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
confound the ability for people to
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
operate as
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are selling in the
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
state because that was my original
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
question and i'm just curious uh clean
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire does does share
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
these concerns about enforceability uh
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i i would uh i would particularly
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
think that the department of
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
environmental services should like to
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
sound uh have their voice heard on on
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
how they would imagine they would
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
enforce this bill um i would also be
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
interested to reach out to the state of
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
washington if if in fact that this is
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
where this language came came from and
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
asked how their experience has been in
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
trying to trying to enforce um and
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
interact with manufacturers that are
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
that are largely overseas
 
01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
that are largely overseas
um

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
if what we're looking for is a program
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
that has a lighter footprint
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest that perhaps some
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
sort of fee that is levied on either
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
installers or or customers
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
might be something that's more
 
01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
might be something that's more
appropriate

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
and that fee could that if he could fund
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of program that um
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
that would that we could we could work
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
with the solar installers to try to
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
determine what what makes sense um i
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
think that that generally speaking clean
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire's concern is with
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
the bill as written not with the concept
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
of trying to come up with some sort of
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
solution for the end of life of solar
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
panels thank you
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
i love to be controversial
 
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
i love to be controversial
uh

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
what i
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
was thinking i'm trying to
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
get it all together so
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
forgive me for a minute when i return my
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
battery i'm the customer so i pay for it
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
so perhaps
 
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.870 align:start position:0%
so perhaps
there

01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
a fee on
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
solar power customers a small fee per
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
and electric companies because most of
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
solar power and correct me if i'm not
 
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.630 align:start position:0%
solar power and correct me if i'm not
wrong

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
is meant is
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
net metered
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
so you really have two customers you
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
have the the
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
the homeowner or and i'm thinking small
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
places because large places are
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
controlled by the s e c if they're large
 
01:10:38.719 --> 01:10:40.149 align:start position:0%
controlled by the s e c if they're large
farms

01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
farms
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh and the other customer is the power
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
company because they buy some of it
 
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.149 align:start position:0%
company because they buy some of it
so

01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
that to me would seem to be a better way
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
to establish a fund
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
for the decommissioning and the
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
recycling especially if you have to
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
transport these panels
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
i would think and and the other question
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
i had is
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
we require an electrician to connect
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
these panels correct
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
do we require an electrician
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
to deconnect them
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
so to answer the last question first the
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
answer is yes a licensed and master
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
electrician is required to to work or
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
that said because it does say our
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
license plates live free or die
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
homeowners are also allowed to do their
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
own electrical work on their own premise
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
premises but uh it is either a master
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
electrician or the homeowner who who uh
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
does that work
 
01:11:35.679 --> 01:11:37.110 align:start position:0%
does that work
um

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest if if it was if if you
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
were asking me my opinion that the most
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate way forward with this bill
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
would be to study the question uh
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
because because would uh some sort of
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
fee levied through your utility bill be
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
a more appropriate way to come up with a
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
recycling and stewardship plan how much
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
would that fee need to be what is the
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
cost of recycling a solar panel what is
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of transporting it uh you know
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
what is the state of the salvage market
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
these are all questions that that i
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
think should be answered before a
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
program is established
 
01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.310 align:start position:0%
program is established
follow-up

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
do you need a follow-up
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
any additional questions representative
 
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
any additional questions representative
lewicki

01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
lewicki
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can you give us
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
any idea what the actual scrap value is
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the solar panel how many pounds of
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
aluminum how many pounds of copper how
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
many pounds of lead you know these are
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
all materials that have commodity value
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
and if we could have a feel for that it
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
might tell us whether it's actually
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
economical to recycle them as is or not
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i i do not have those numbers
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
at my fingertips um what i can tell you
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that the in terms of the weight of
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
solar panels most of the weight is glass
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
and aluminum um the actual the actual uh
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know functional uh pieces of a solar
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
panel the silicon and the and the metals
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh the conductors that are contained
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
therein are you know typically less than
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
25 of the weight of a solar panel so
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
really what we're talking about is
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
something that would recycle aluminum
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
and glass and would and would
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
deconstruct the panels into their
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
composite parts and then the question of
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
how to deal with the heavy metals that
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
are part of the that are part of the the
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
system that conducts the electricity
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
through the panel it's the same the same
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
way that you that you recycle e-waste
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
generally and that is that is a
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
complicated uh and and frankly dirty
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
process um which i think is highlighted
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
in in this bill and in representative
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
plett's testimony um but that said uh
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
the i i would go back to my my initial
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
point here which is why are we singling
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
out this particular uh product when
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
there is no such stewardship plan for
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
any other type of e-waste uh and and the
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative did in his own testimony
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
sen uh uh highlight that this would this
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
this product is only one percent of the
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
global uh weight of e-waste that's
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
produced each year so so
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh that that is simply my question it
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
seems like this bill is singling out a
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
specific product and i'm not sure why
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
no follow-up okay
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
next up is representative partial
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair vos and uh thank you mr
 
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.790 align:start position:0%
thank you chair vos and uh thank you mr
brown

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
brown
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that we can't always
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
depend on private industry to take
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility especially if there's no
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
profit to be made
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
we know right now that consumers are
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
already paying much of the price of
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
disposal of products right across the
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
board whether it be plastic bottles or
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
my transfer station in marlboro
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh was funded self-funded by the
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
overseas sales of plastic china all the
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
recyclables were going over there now
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
they've recently stopped buying these
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
plastics the market's fallen and we now
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
have to take up the additional cost of
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
our disposing
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
and our transfer station as community
 
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.310 align:start position:0%
and our transfer station as community
um

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
now could you foresee a similar ferris
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
question could you foresee a similar
 
01:15:03.679 --> 01:15:04.950 align:start position:0%
question could you foresee a similar
situation

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
with recycling in solar panels should
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
the market for the recyclables that are
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
derived from that fall out and would
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
have built in
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
the implied question is a bill like this
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate in that like
 
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate in that like
uh

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is is yes of
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
course i think that that there may
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
eventually be a problem that would need
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
to be solved the question of uh do we
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
need to create a program preemptively
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
before a problem begins to materialize
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh that that is the question before us
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
today right are we going to create a
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
program preemptively before problem
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
materializes uh
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
i one thing that i would say is that
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire does not take
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
a position on um enhanced producer
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
recyclability did i get that right
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility responsibility um
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
programs um that but but at the bare
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
minimum such a such a program that
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
encompasses all the items that go into
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
our waste stream does have the benefit
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
of being ideologically consistent as
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to singling out individual items
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh from the waste stream and uh so so i
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
would simply suggest that that if what
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
what is the problem we are trying to
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
solve here is the problem how we manage
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
our waste streams if so it seems that
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
the bill should be written differently
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
um if the problem is the the amount of
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
solar panels going into landfills today
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
i would suggest we don't really have a
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem yet
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and i did have a second
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
question but i think you answered it so
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you both okay thank you
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative manners no okay
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative thomas did you have
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
another question uh thank you miss chair
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
i i think it may have been an answer but
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'll ask it any different way
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
transportation accidents faulty panels
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
there have been um panels that had to be
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
disposed right now
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
how is that handled right now and is it
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
is it just purely landfilled or as is or
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
do they break the glass up and segregate
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
how is it handled now the the answer to
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
that question is
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
is that i don't have the numbers to
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
answer with with great precision but i
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
can tell you that uh all of the above do
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
occur i'm certain that there are panels
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
that have wound up in landfills i am
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
certain that there are panels in the
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
united states that have been recycled
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
into their composite parts what i do not
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
know and can i answer for you today is
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
what percentage of each practice has
 
01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
what percentage of each practice has
happened

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thanks for follow-up so
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
for the ones that are currently in
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
landfill now do you foresee
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
a future not in the two distant
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
future where they will discover that
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
those landfills will become
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
toxic like the super sites
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh again uh the the if the question is
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh is the volume of solar panels being
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
disposed of in our landfills creating
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
for instance uh groundwater problems is
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
a broader question um and i would i
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
would also add that it's a question that
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
is not confined simply to the disposal
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
of solar panels but also uh i i know for
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
a fact that uh double a batteries go
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
into the go into landfills all the time
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
even though they shouldn't and the same
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
the same problem applies to whenever
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
that happens and so that is a broader
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
question of our solid waste management
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
and if what if that's what we're
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about there should be a
 
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
broader program of how we approach solid
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
waste management including uh you know
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring the integrity of the lining of
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
landfills and their caps and all the
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
other things that the department of
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
environmental services is
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
charged with
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh looking for additional
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
questions from mr evans brown
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you mr evans brown
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony we appreciate you
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
coming here today and uh giving us your
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you very much
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
well it's 10 22.
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
and we're done nobody else has signed up
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill
 
01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill
and

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
i have not scheduled another bill until
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
12 30. so we're going to have a
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
lengthy lunch break today
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
unless anybody has
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
something that they would like to
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
discuss before we break for lunch
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
in which case representative mick
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
williams is recognized
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair votes i wanted to ask
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
about working in subcommittees for this
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
committee um will we be assigning any
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
folks especially for the early bills to
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
do some working committees i've noticed
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
that as our scheduling
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
for the last couple of hearings we've
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
had some openings that perhaps could
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
have been an opportunity for a
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to get together and i'm
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
hoping we could maybe talk about that
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you were here earlier we
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
did establish a subcommittee earlier
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
today for house bill 1644 the 5g bill
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
and that committee will be meeting on
 
01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.070 align:start position:0%
and that committee will be meeting on
monday

01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
monday
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
we have not established any
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittees for any other bills
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
i am scheduling an exact session for our
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
five early bills on monday february 7th
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
we will complete the public hearing on
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
hb 1644 at one o'clock
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
on february 7th and then at 2 o'clock on
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
february 7th
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
start an executive session on the five
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
early bills
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
of which hb 1644 is won
 
01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.550 align:start position:0%
of which hb 1644 is won
so

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
if anybody sees any need for a
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on the other four bills
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
that are targeted for that executive
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
session please
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
right away
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can think about whether or
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
not we should form such a said committee
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
the four bills that you're talking about
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
we have i think five fn bills so which
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
ones specifically are they from
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
1 11 or 1
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
18 or
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
yeah but that would be the fns right or
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
well interestingly uh
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
informed me that five of our bills were
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
early bills
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
and there were a couple that had an fn
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
after them that weren't on that list so
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the criteria they use for
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
determining what's an early bill and
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
what isn't
 
01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.709 align:start position:0%
what isn't
is

01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
i did send an email earlier today to
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
our admin gary morris about setting up
 
01:21:47.679 --> 01:21:48.470 align:start position:0%
our admin gary morris about setting up
the

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
exec session for february 7th i've got
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
to go talk to her about adding the
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
continuation of
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on hb14 1644 to that
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
list but um
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
i can if you want to go with me we can
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
go over there and and
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
quickly identify what the other four
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
bills were
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head they were
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that establishes a
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
concert climate conservation corps
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
commission okay um
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm i'm not dredging it up from my
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
memory exactly what four they were but
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're the bills that i talked
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
about at the beginning of our session as
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
being early bills that have to be done
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
by february 17th
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
and just last week we're informed that
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
we have to move that date up to february
 
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.550 align:start position:0%
we have to move that date up to february
10th

01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
10th
 
01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
10th
because

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
the speaker had to schedule a house
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
session the week of february 14th which
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
means it will likely be on the 17th
 
01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
means it will likely be on the 17th
so

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
in order to get those bills done by the
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
10th we have to have this exact session
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
on february 7th yep
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
again my brent's not working too well on
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
the seventh and does that mean we have a
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
free morning
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
and can we use some of that for
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
discussion time on the bill i mean you
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
said one o'clock you're gonna schedule
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the public hearing and two
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock the executive session
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
what's the plan for the morning
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
there is no plan for the morning at the
 
01:23:28.239 --> 01:23:29.189 align:start position:0%
there is no plan for the morning at the
moment

01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:30.149 align:start position:0%
moment
so

01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
but you're right that time is available
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
and if we see the need as a committee to
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
schedule some
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
a work session for that for that period
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
of time we can do that
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's why i raised the issue to discuss
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
do we need any more subcommittee work
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
sessions on those five bills
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee i would very much
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
like to have time to work with
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative platt on 1459 to discuss
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were raised
 
01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:01.510 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were raised
today

01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's not an early bill you're right
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying if we have a work
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
session or if we have time where we can
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
put in bills that we'd like to discuss
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
further my interpretation is that this
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
is not an early bill because it's
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh is so far in the in the future so
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
that's why i guess the clerk decided it
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
didn't need to be an early bill
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
but certainly i'm not opposed to setting
 
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
but certainly i'm not opposed to setting
up

01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee for this bill
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it needs to be done on
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
february 7th
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
or before that but we do need to have a
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
probably have a subcommittee for this
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill eventually yes
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested in what the
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
representatives think uh it needs
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
tweaking in the bill frankly i thought
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
it was well written i want to present it
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
as is but if somebody if there's an
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelming desire to change it in some
 
01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.790 align:start position:0%
overwhelming desire to change it in some
way

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'll listen
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
i'll allow representative mcgee to
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
answer that question yeah i would just
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
say i think it is very well written i i
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
think what i'm concerned about is if
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to produce the desired
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes and i think there are some
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
issues to talk through in terms of
 
01:25:12.639 --> 01:25:13.750 align:start position:0%
issues to talk through in terms of
whether

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.870 align:start position:0%
whether
um

01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get in terms of the
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
the goal
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
is actually going to be achieved by the
 
01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:23.830 align:start position:0%
is actually going to be achieved by the
bill

01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
i think callie pits yeah i think that
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
two hours ago i said i thought it needed
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be a study committee
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
i think it needs to be a study
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
commission and i i would want to work
 
01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
commission and i i would want to work
with

01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:25:38.159 --> 01:25:39.430 align:start position:0%
with
representative

01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
on perhaps doing that
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that the next session you could come
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
up with some
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
really positive details and some
 
01:25:46.639 --> 01:25:48.229 align:start position:0%
really positive details and some
information

01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:49.669 align:start position:0%
information
i

01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
the more i think about it the more
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised i think we
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
need to really work on answering some of
 
01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
need to really work on answering some of
those

01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
not that the bill isn't well written not
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
that cia that washington state doesn't
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
have some good ideas
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
but i i really think we have to
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
call it into new hampshire
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i really think we need to look at
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that input why don't
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
we do this
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
anybody who's interested in serving on a
 
01:26:20.159 --> 01:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
anybody who's interested in serving on a
subcommittee

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
on hb 1469 the solar recycling bill
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
please send me an email
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
and once uh
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
i get
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
let's let's i put a should put a
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
deadline on this send me an email by a
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
week from
 
01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.629 align:start position:0%
week from
today

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
which would be february february 1st
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
and once i have that information i will
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
determine if there are enough
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
interested persons to form a study
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee or a
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and if so we'll form one
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
01:26:57.679 --> 01:27:00.229 align:start position:0%
how's that
acceptable

01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
okay any other issues representative
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
mann thank you mr mr chairman i'm my
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
concern is um
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
get an understanding of the details of
 
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.430 align:start position:0%
get an understanding of the details of
recycling

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of early recycling parts like
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
taking off the aluminum and the copper
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
should be quite easy but
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
some of the later steps
 
01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.070 align:start position:0%
some of the later steps
so

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
if we could understand how the industry
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
would actually the recycling industry
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
would actually work
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
it might actually be helpful to inform
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
our legislation
 
01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.669 align:start position:0%
our legislation
um

01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
there needs to be also some financial
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
incentive for the recycling to take
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
place and of course that's what this
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill is about but
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier perhaps the person the
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
company is replacing a solar panel which
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
is the most likely
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
reason to
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.669 align:start position:0%
might be
[Music]

01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
by requiring them to
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
supervise the recycling or make sure
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
that it's done properly that might be
 
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.709 align:start position:0%
that it's done properly that might be
useful

01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a thought that would be
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
that would be part of the study
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee that's being recommended now
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thoughts on that i've
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
i've done some reading about recycling
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
of solar panels and the reading i've
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
done is suggested
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
that the cost to recycle a solar panel
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
exceeds the value of the materials you
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
you derive from that recycling process
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it would seem on the surface
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
to be uneconomic to recycle recycle a
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
solar panel but
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's something we should investigate
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
in in detail
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill is is
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
less concerned with recycling solar
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
panels than it is
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
in protecting new hampshire
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities from having to deal with
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
unexpected costs
 
01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.550 align:start position:0%
unexpected costs
when

01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
solar panels show up on their doorstep
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um it's interesting
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
on the entire conversation with um
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
1469 and all the other items they were
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned about being recycled
 
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
mentioned about being recycled
that

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
what was interesting was wind turbines
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
were never brought up
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
and so i might
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
suggest that if the committee decides
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
they want to expand the bill and i'm not
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
saying they should but if they do
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
wind turbines should play
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
a major factor if they don't already
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate point most wind farms
 
01:29:44.639 --> 01:29:46.070 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate point most wind farms
are

01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
large enough that they are
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
governed by the rules of the site
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee which requires
 
01:29:51.679 --> 01:29:54.950 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee which requires
decommissioning

01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
as part of the
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
the overall project plan and its cost
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
but it is something we should look at
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
because there may be especially going
 
01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.790 align:start position:0%
because there may be especially going
forward

01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
it may be possible for an individual
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
homeowner to
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
put a a wind turbine in his backyard and
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
generate electricity so it might be
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
worthwhile considering how to deal with
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
the waste generated by recycling one of
 
01:30:18.239 --> 01:30:20.629 align:start position:0%
the waste generated by recycling one of
those

01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay any any other comments before we
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
i will recess
 
01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.110 align:start position:0%
i will recess

01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
this meeting today until 12 30 at which
 
01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.350 align:start position:0%
this meeting today until 12 30 at which
time

01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
we will hear
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 1628
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
directing the department of energy to
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
generate a report on the micro grid
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
project currently in progress at the
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire in

been
 
03:35:21.990 --> 03:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
that since there was a
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
microgrid project being developed by the
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
un university new hampshire and
 
03:35:26.880 --> 03:35:28.150 align:start position:0%
un university new hampshire and
eversource

03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
03:35:30.790 --> 03:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh as well as i think unitil
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh i wanted us to have some type of a
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
report or documentation about that
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
about that project uh to guide us with
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
looking at other possibilities for
 
03:35:41.359 --> 03:35:42.790 align:start position:0%
looking at other possibilities for
microgrades

03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
microgrades
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
however i was
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
informed with conversations from
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
tom cronin of unh and from donna gamache
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
of eversource that in fact
 
03:35:54.550 --> 03:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:35:57.190 --> 03:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
this is not the only microgrid uh in
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
progress and in fact some businesses
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
already have their own separate
 
03:36:01.200 --> 03:36:02.630 align:start position:0%
already have their own separate
microgrids

03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
microgrids
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the state that unh is aware of and so
 
03:36:06.960 --> 03:36:07.830 align:start position:0%
in the state that unh is aware of and so
um

03:36:07.830 --> 03:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
they asked me to broaden my bill
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
to not just focus on the project at unh
 
03:36:14.560 --> 03:36:16.309 align:start position:0%
to not just focus on the project at unh
and

03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:19.110 --> 03:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
and the one with eversource and unh but
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
also to
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
focus on trying to accumulate a report
 
03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
that in fact inventories
 
03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
the current
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
projects that have been in place already
 
03:36:32.550 --> 03:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
and are or are being developed right now
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and put a report like
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
that together by november first so we
 
03:36:39.429 --> 03:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
have a more comprehensive look at what's
 
03:36:41.349 --> 03:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
going on in new hampshire and we just
 
03:36:43.990 --> 03:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't focus on one single project which
 
03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
incidentally has stalled for a very
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons and i'm sure some of
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
the testimony we'll hear after me will
 
03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:52.229 align:start position:0%
the testimony we'll hear after me will
explain

03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
explain
 
03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
so that was the motivation behind this
 
03:36:54.399 --> 03:36:57.269 align:start position:0%
so that was the motivation behind this
and

03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
that's all really i have to say about it
 
03:37:01.030 --> 03:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm willing to take any questions i
 
03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
can answer right now and i'm sure some
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
of the people
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
behind me who will be testifying will
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
give more details about that
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative samson for
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
that bill introduction are there any
 
03:37:16.950 --> 03:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative thomas is
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you mr chair thank you
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i guess the
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
including unh but perhaps other
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
areas that have microgrids
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
do they do they not have reports that
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
they are doing at least internally
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
as to how their microgrids are doing
 
03:37:39.429 --> 03:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
have did you ask them or look into
 
03:37:41.190 --> 03:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
whether they would have some some
 
03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
reports generated
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
within themselves
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh represent
 
03:37:49.590 --> 03:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
thomas uh i
 
03:37:52.229 --> 03:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
i was not aware of businesses that were
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
until a couple days ago until unh
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
contacted me about it
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
and um they were the ones who said they
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
know of several businesses who are doing
 
03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
know of several businesses who are doing
this

03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there's an internal report
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
about it at the at the companies
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
involved i just didn't have any kind of
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
any link yet with the companies to find
 
03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
out more about it and i thought this
 
03:38:17.910 --> 03:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
report would be an ideal way of
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
gathering that information in one report
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
together from all the sites in new
 
03:38:25.750 --> 03:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i i think some people who
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
will testify after me will talk about
 
03:38:29.910 --> 03:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
that very issue
 
03:38:33.030 --> 03:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay i'll look forward to that thank you
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
do microgrids have to be
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
registered or licensed or approved by
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh representative calpis
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
i i'm not exactly sure what how that's
 
03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
done but my understanding is that since
 
03:39:01.349 --> 03:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
the utility has to be involved there has
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be some approval process that lets
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
the utility work with an entity to
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
create a microgrid
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
as part of the puc process but
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the details how that
 
03:39:14.790 --> 03:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
works i'm sure you just can't do it on
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
your own
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
now you could do i guess you could do a
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
microgrid that doesn't connect to the
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
main grid if it's just your internal use
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of what i'd like to know
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
how these businesses are doing it versus
 
03:39:31.510 --> 03:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
like a public entity like unh would be
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
doing it with eversource and they were
 
03:39:35.349 --> 03:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
doing it with unitil as well so they're
 
03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
doing the gas utility electric utility
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the campus
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's a much bigger entity
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
but i'm not aware what the process is
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure there's some type of
 
03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
regulation or registration of that
 
03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
process before you can go ahead with it
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
my point of the question was would the
 
03:39:56.399 --> 03:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
my point of the question was would the
utilities

03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me have the information
 
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we're seeking and have if they do
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
could we ask them to
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
relate it to us so if they have
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
helped in the process of creating some
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
of these microgrids i'm sure that they
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
would have
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
some of that information that's all
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you that my initial
 
03:40:18.640 --> 03:40:19.429 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you that my initial
uh

03:40:19.429 --> 03:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
intention of the initial bill was to get
 
03:40:23.590 --> 03:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
that information about the unh project
 
03:40:26.070 --> 03:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
from eversource and from the unh
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
and uh but they made me aware that
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's more out there than just that
 
03:40:32.710 --> 03:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
one project
 
03:40:34.870 --> 03:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay ms gamache has signed up to testify
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
for eversource so i'm sure she'll have
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
additional information to supply
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you uh
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
my honorable colleague for your bill
 
03:40:50.239 --> 03:40:51.590 align:start position:0%
my honorable colleague for your bill
introduction

03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
on griffin
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
roberge from the department of energy
 
03:41:01.030 --> 03:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
who has signed up to testify for two
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the record uh griffin
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
roberge from the new hampshire
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:41:22.150 --> 03:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
here to testify in a neutral position on
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1628 um unfortunately i can't
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
speak substantially to the amendment as
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'm only just now seeing it
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i can't really give a lot of feedback
 
03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
on that until i have a chance to kind of
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
review it with other staff and
 
03:41:40.389 --> 03:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
provide some feedback on it which i'm
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
more than willing to do at a later date
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh v yeah gotta write sorry via email um
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh house bill
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
1628 fn as introduced
 
03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
the department outlaw outlined um
 
03:41:55.359 --> 03:41:56.469 align:start position:0%
the department outlaw outlined um
some

03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
some observations in the fiscal note
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
specifically on lines 19 and 20
 
03:42:05.349 --> 03:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
where it requires the department of
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
energy to
 
03:42:09.269 --> 03:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
generate a report describing new
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire communities where a micro grid
 
03:42:13.269 --> 03:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
project may have the greatest impact
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
i i you know based on the fiscal note it
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
said that a lot of of what was required
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
under this previous report could be
 
03:42:20.309 --> 03:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
accomplished by existing staff and
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
funding but that
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
sentence on lines 19 and 20 was a little
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
bit broad
 
03:42:28.630 --> 03:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
i guess the phrase greatest impact is
 
03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
not defined so
 
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
are we talking about reduction of
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions reduction in
 
03:42:36.389 --> 03:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
electric costs
 
03:42:37.830 --> 03:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
that would need to be flushed out but
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
again you know that's a previous version
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
03:42:40.800 --> 03:42:41.910 align:start position:0%
of the bill
um

03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of microgrids currently in the
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
state and i know
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
donna gamache is behind me she can
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
certainly correct anything i have to say
 
03:42:49.359 --> 03:42:50.469 align:start position:0%
certainly correct anything i have to say
but

03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
i know there is an ongoing docket at the
 
03:42:58.590 --> 03:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
19057 if anyone's interested um in part
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
of that docket um eversource proposed um
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
two projects as part of a uh
 
03:43:11.189 --> 03:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's part of a grid transformation
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
transformation and enablement program
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
and one of those is obviously the unh
 
03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:16.070 align:start position:0%
and one of those is obviously the unh
project

03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the purposes of this it's the
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
oyster river
 
03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
clean innovation project
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
after talking with tom france who's the
 
03:43:26.550 --> 03:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
director of regulatory support at the
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
department um
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
eversource and unh are no longer
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
pursuing this project
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
at unh
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
in my shorthand conversations with unh
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
staffing funding issues that type of
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
thing are the greatest concern for them
 
03:43:44.870 --> 03:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
mr director france also reached out to
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
other regulated utilities in the state
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
to see if they have any active micro
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
grid projects currently in existence
 
03:43:55.830 --> 03:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
and as of just a few moments ago i we
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
heard back from liberty unitel and
 
03:43:59.429 --> 03:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
eversource and to the best of our
 
03:43:59.439 --> 03:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
eversource and to the best of our
knowledge

03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
03:44:02.550 --> 03:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
there aren't any active microgrid
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
projects in the state that they're aware
 
03:44:04.399 --> 03:44:05.189 align:start position:0%
projects in the state that they're aware
of

03:44:05.189 --> 03:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
at least under
 
03:44:09.030 --> 03:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
eversource's proposal they
 
03:44:09.040 --> 03:44:10.630 align:start position:0%
eversource's proposal they
um

03:44:10.630 --> 03:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
in this dock at 19057 they intended to
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
take out these two projects from the
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
docket and then submit it to puc for
 
03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
review and approval in a separate docket
 
03:44:21.199 --> 03:44:22.229 align:start position:0%
review and approval in a separate docket
however

03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
no docket has been filed to date again
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
because unh is no longer pursuing the
 
03:44:26.720 --> 03:44:28.070 align:start position:0%
because unh is no longer pursuing the
project

03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any questions that the
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee might have but again um any
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
questions relevant to the amendment that
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer more than willing to
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
provide an email with
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh written comments at a later time

basically says nothing it says
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do anything
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
and they said that they would
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
forward a completed fiscal note to the
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%

03:46:00.389 --> 03:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to know do you know if all
 
03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
mike any and all microgrids in the state
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
are subject to regulation
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
going off of your last question as to
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not they they
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
receive puc review and approval i assume
 
03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
utilities when they're pursuing a
 
03:46:19.990 --> 03:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
project like that would like to
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
engage in cost recovery in which case
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
yes it would be subject to puc review
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
and approval
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
man follow-up follow-up would that
 
03:46:26.880 --> 03:46:28.710 align:start position:0%
man follow-up follow-up would that
include

03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:46:31.110 --> 03:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
private businesses i couldn't answer
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
that definitively i can certainly check
 
03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
but you know to the extent you know that
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
say utility worked to the private
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
business to develop its own micro grid
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
project i'm assuming
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
you know a utility might want to pursue
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
cost recovery of that but i can
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
certainly look into that thank you for
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
being private businesses thank you
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized
 
03:46:52.229 --> 03:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:46:54.150 --> 03:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
question did i understand you to say
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
there are no active
 
03:46:56.160 --> 03:46:57.349 align:start position:0%
there are no active
microgrid

03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
microgrid
 
03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
grid projects being pursued anywhere in
 
03:47:00.630 --> 03:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:47:02.070 --> 03:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
again i can't predict what the future
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
might say but again based on
 
03:47:05.349 --> 03:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
correspondence that uh the the
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
department has had with uh three
 
03:47:09.269 --> 03:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities in the state liberty
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
unitel eversource um they are not aware
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
of any microgrid projects currently in
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
existence in there and is still
 
03:47:15.439 --> 03:47:16.870 align:start position:0%
existence in there and is still
premature

03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
premature
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
i guess that was a follow-up but you
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't need to answer it
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized thank
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you mr robert
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again good to see you um
 
03:47:33.990 --> 03:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
so when you
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
talked about the bill and doe's position
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
or non-position you know looking at the
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill you mentioned
 
03:47:42.309 --> 03:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh two different items that you were
 
03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
unsure whether the bill was asking of
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
doe because it was kind of vague and you
 
03:47:48.550 --> 03:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
said you know are you looking at
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
lowering emissions or are you looking at
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
costs yep um
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
and i think the thing that i would bring
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
up that i think doe would be helpful in
 
03:47:58.710 --> 03:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
especially if there aren't any active
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
plans going on right now
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
is the idea of resiliency which is i
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
think the point of microgrids is to have
 
03:48:07.349 --> 03:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of self-sufficiency
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
and for different areas and businesses
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
or towns to have some ability to take
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
care of their own energy needs in case
 
03:48:17.189 --> 03:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
of something going wrong so i think
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's probably where that vague thing
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
was going so i i don't know if the
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
department has had any discussions
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
around the role of microgrids or
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
whether there should be any role for the
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
department energy of energy in trying to
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
look at whether
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
microgrids make sense in parts of new
 
03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire sure and and that's something
 
03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
hampshire sure and and that's something
i'm

03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
certain could be studied or something
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
like that but in terms of i guess the
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
specific concerns on lines 19 to 20
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
again it's just greatest impact
 
03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
departments i think is the committee
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
well know love as much clarity as
 
03:48:50.710 --> 03:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
possible so um you know getting some
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
specificity to that as to specifically
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
what the department is looking at what
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature would like to see in
 
03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
terms of greatest impact would be
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
welcomed but again that's in the as
 
03:49:01.349 --> 03:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
introduced version of the bill and again
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to you know welcome the
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment more definitively
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the amendment after i have a chance
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh any additional questions for
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative lewicki
 
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh looking for information but do we
 
03:49:24.309 --> 03:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
know how many uh base
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
how many people who are just off grid
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
that have a significant grid of their
 
03:49:30.550 --> 03:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
own is this a knowable thing
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
and how do we define the difference
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
between off grid and microgrid micro
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
good i would assume means it will be
 
03:49:38.790 --> 03:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
connected to the main grid some of the
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
time yeah sure so a micro grid is
 
03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
basically a group of say interconnected
 
03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
loads and distribute energy resources
 
03:49:48.150 --> 03:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
your battery storage your solar that can
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of flip on and off the grid
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
when necessary or at will
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
as representative mcgee noted you know
 
03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
discussions that microgrids might be
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
beneficial to
 
03:50:02.550 --> 03:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
deploy these distributed energy
 
03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
resources and also improve resiliency
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing and to also kind
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
of be a
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
a modified way of addressing issues in
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
the distribution system say if there's
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
an outage or something like that to
 
03:50:17.110 --> 03:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
redirect resources elsewhere um in terms
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
of your specific question in terms of
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
tallying you know individual homeowners
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
or specific businesses that may may or
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
may not be off the grid
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
i i couldn't answer that definitively at
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
this time
 
03:50:32.229 --> 03:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
again you know going back to what was
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
being proposed in the docket between
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
eversource and unh you know that was
 
03:50:37.990 --> 03:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
something that came but came through for
 
03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh cost recovery in a in a docket um you
 
03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:42.710 align:start position:0%
uh cost recovery in a in a docket um you
know

03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of what a private business or a
 
03:50:46.389 --> 03:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
private residence might do with power
 
03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
that they're generating on site i can't
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
speak to that definitively but i can
 
03:50:50.950 --> 03:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
certainly you know dig a little bit more
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
into that and get you a more substantial
 
03:50:52.399 --> 03:50:55.990 align:start position:0%
into that and get you a more substantial
answer

03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.000 --> 03:50:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:00.469 --> 03:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
any more questions for mr roberge
 
03:51:02.550 --> 03:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh thank you mr roberge for
 
03:51:04.870 --> 03:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you and i will next
 
03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
call on miss donna gamash from
 
03:51:07.359 --> 03:51:09.510 align:start position:0%
call on miss donna gamash from
eversource

03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.469 --> 03:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
please turn on the microphone
 
03:51:20.479 --> 03:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
please turn on the microphone
sorry

03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
for the record donna gamache with
 
03:51:24.630 --> 03:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
eversource energy thank you very much
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
for um uh hearing my testimony today
 
03:51:30.150 --> 03:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to speak to this our
 
03:51:33.269 --> 03:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
situation with unh and why um it no
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
longer is a pro it's no longer viable
 
03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
for us at the moment
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
originally the project was intended to
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
be a pilot so that we could learn some
 
03:51:43.750 --> 03:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
lessons from it where the weaknesses
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
were some barriers challenges
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
and what we were going to do originally
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
unh was the perfect place because if you
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
think you know to the questions that
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard before why would you even
 
03:51:57.269 --> 03:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
have a microgrid and really in our minds
 
03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
the microgrid would be to be helpful in
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
a certain geographic area when you have
 
03:52:05.830 --> 03:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
a a storm an outage for some various
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
lengths of time
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
and unh obviously is like a little
 
03:52:11.590 --> 03:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
community where folks could go for
 
03:52:11.600 --> 03:52:12.389 align:start position:0%
community where folks could go for
shelter

03:52:12.389 --> 03:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
but you would also so you would make
 
03:52:16.469 --> 03:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
sure that you had isolated that area
 
03:52:18.150 --> 03:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
whatever that geographic area is and you
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
had enough energy to just keep the
 
03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
critical facilities open and you could
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
have folks go for shelter for as long a
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
period as possible
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
so unh was perfect at the time because
 
03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
they have roughly 13 megawatts of
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
existing generations assets owned by unh
 
03:52:36.790 --> 03:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
and um griffin was correct
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
when he was talking generally about
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
microgrid you abs you have to that
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
generation helps
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
them in their existing needs but if
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to use it as a microgrid
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
you have to augment that generation so
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
we were going to add some solar and it
 
03:52:51.750 --> 03:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
was roughly five megawatts of solar plus
 
03:52:53.429 --> 03:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
some conservation
 
03:52:55.830 --> 03:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
and the and we were going to island the
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
school during whatever outage you know
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
duration it was as well as serving a
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
portion of the town of durham so by the
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
way the town of durham was also a
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
partner in this
 
03:53:03.920 --> 03:53:04.950 align:start position:0%
partner in this
um

03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:07.269 --> 03:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
and the critical facilities that we were
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to ensure would continue to
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
operate was their wastewater treatment
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
plant police and fire departments and
 
03:53:14.070 --> 03:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
their town halls as well as the
 
03:53:14.080 --> 03:53:18.070 align:start position:0%
their town halls as well as the
university

03:53:18.070 --> 03:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
we found very soon that we were bumping
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
into some challenges first off covet hit
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
griffin spoke to what unh said about
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
their challenges their resources took a
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
big hit not entirely because of covet
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
but that played a big role in it
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
this the resources became scarce in
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
order to keep moving forward but beyond
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
that the other challenges were
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
basically the costs
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
um to your point representative cali
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
pits if a utility is engaged in any way
 
03:53:49.349 --> 03:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
and the utility is going to have to
 
03:53:51.429 --> 03:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
recover costs we do have to get public
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
utility permission we have our regulator
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
has to approve it we have to make our
 
03:53:55.600 --> 03:53:56.550 align:start position:0%
has to approve it we have to make our
case

03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:53:58.319 --> 03:53:59.830 align:start position:0%
and um
ultimately

03:53:59.830 --> 03:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
what we found was there are certain high
 
03:54:04.950 --> 03:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
costs associated with it we in this
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
particular plan we never intended to own
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
the solar so we assumed in the cost of
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
this that there would be another third
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
party that owned the solar so we did not
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
include that but we found in terms of
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
some of the distribution requirements
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
there were costs associated there
 
03:54:20.720 --> 03:54:21.830 align:start position:0%
there were costs associated there
and

03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the storage it also included storage
 
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
and there were costs associated with the
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
storage so in early discussions with our
 
03:54:29.110 --> 03:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
regulators we realized that we were
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
going to have to try to come up with
 
03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
some grants to allow us to move forward
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
to learn the lessons that this could
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
provide us
 
03:54:38.469 --> 03:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
for the state generally but buy down
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
some of those higher costs and so we
 
03:54:43.110 --> 03:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
spent a great deal of time and resources
 
03:54:45.990 --> 03:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
trying to actively get some federal
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
grants to buy it down and we found that
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be very challenging those grants are
 
03:54:50.720 --> 03:54:51.830 align:start position:0%
to be very challenging those grants are
not

03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:54:51.840 --> 03:54:52.710 align:start position:0%
not
um

03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
suited very well for something like this
 
03:54:55.520 --> 03:54:56.309 align:start position:0%
suited very well for something like this
so

03:54:56.309 --> 03:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:58.229 --> 03:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
um as we were going to continue down
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
that path but what we quickly bumped
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
into was that
 
03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee you did say the
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
purpose is resiliency
 
03:55:08.229 --> 03:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
and you're correct you're quite right so
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
we would have to bring to the public
 
03:55:12.150 --> 03:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
utilities commission a really
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate cost-benefit analysis that
 
03:55:15.990 --> 03:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
showed that the benefits outweighed the
 
03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:16.870 align:start position:0%
showed that the benefits outweighed the
cost

03:55:16.870 --> 03:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
and one of the benefits is resiliency
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
but you have to be able to monetize that
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
benefit and it we found no place in the
 
03:55:27.910 --> 03:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
nation where there is a an analysis that
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
allows us to be able to monetize that
 
03:55:33.030 --> 03:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
so it was going to be a bigger challenge
 
03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
now i also checked with our team to find
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
out okay where else in our service
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
territory do we have microgrids because
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
i have heard about them in the past and
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
we have several in connecticut not all
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
of them uh are part of you know that
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
connected with us but um connecticut
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
started initiative to move forward with
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
microgrids in 2011 2012 time period
 
03:55:58.150 --> 03:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
after they're very serious i think it
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
was super storm sandy they decided that
 
03:56:01.590 --> 03:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
they had to take matters into their own
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
hands that changes the cost benefit
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
analysis enough that maybe not having
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
that resiliency analysis would was okay
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts um we do have
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
microgrids there um on the military some
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
of the military bases i don't know but
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
the military covering the cost of those
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
and obviously for reasons other than uh
 
03:56:23.830 --> 03:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know national security the cost
 
03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis takes there's a little
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
different approach there we um have
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
worked on feasibility for about 20 other
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
projects in
 
03:56:35.510 --> 03:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts as well but so far none
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
of those have come to fruition yet but i
 
03:56:39.269 --> 03:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
my i don't know if they're all still on
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
the table or not but
 
03:56:42.870 --> 03:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
anyway in a in a nutshell that's the
 
03:56:44.550 --> 03:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
issue that happened to us we did
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time that we did work
 
03:56:48.389 --> 03:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
with unh and with the town of durham uh
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
they were and unitil uh they were very
 
03:56:54.150 --> 03:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
very um good partners and um hopefully
 
03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh there is what i did learn is that
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
there is a um
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember the name of it
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
there is a group uh that is trying to
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
put together some short-term and
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
long-term analysis of how you can
 
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
quantify the benefits of resiliency
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
so they're actively working that now so
 
03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully soon we'll see we'll see an
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
outcome of that
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that testimony
 
03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
let me
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
typing catch up first there i'm all set
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
up this was a pilot
 
03:57:32.070 --> 03:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
being a pilot you don't necessarily have
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
to prove
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
beforehand that the benefit is there
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
you're learning from it is that so
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to answer that exactly
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
i would have to talk to our regulatory
 
03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
folks but i do know that originally
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
we wanted this to be part of our rate
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
case and we agreed to take it out of the
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
rate case and file something separately
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
as griffin referred to
 
03:57:56.150 --> 03:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that we could um
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
basically get into more of the
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty on it i don't know if we
 
03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
were going to move forward with that
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
case before during and after or just
 
03:58:05.429 --> 03:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
after i'm i'm sorry i don't have the
 
03:58:07.110 --> 03:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
answer but i could check follow up
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
please follow up um
 
03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
i thought you did have a micro grid
 
03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
my memory's escaping me chester field i
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
think was an area that was really weak
 
03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
with transmission and so you're putting
 
03:58:18.640 --> 03:58:19.269 align:start position:0%
with transmission and so you're putting
a

03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.269 --> 03:58:25.279 align:start position:0%
in combination with the transmission to
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh keep that system alive is that so are
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
you aware of that well if if that's the
 
03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
case i don't think we called it or we
 
03:58:34.150 --> 03:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
may not have used the term microgrid
 
03:58:35.910 --> 03:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
with that we may have had a mobile
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
substation or something that we put in
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
place and i mean
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
i guess it's terminology but i my my
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
recollection was a mobile
 
03:58:44.479 --> 03:58:45.910 align:start position:0%
recollection was a mobile
substation

03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
substation
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:58:49.750 --> 03:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
thomas is recognized thank you mr chair
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i'm i'm
 
03:58:52.469 --> 03:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
curious since you mentioned
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
massachusetts about some military bases
 
03:58:58.150 --> 03:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh having microgrids i'm wondering if
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
one of them was hanscom air force base
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason why i'm asking the
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
question is because just a few days ago
 
03:59:06.150 --> 03:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
hanscom lost total power on their base
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
so i was just curious and and if you
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
could explain how you know
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
if if you know those things how how
 
03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
i could i could dig a little more for
 
03:59:16.710 --> 03:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
you i didn't i don't have that
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
information handy but i can do that for
 
03:59:20.070 --> 03:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
you i'll get that right thank you you're
 
03:59:20.080 --> 03:59:22.469 align:start position:0%
you i'll get that right thank you you're
welcome

03:59:22.469 --> 03:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
berezni is recognized
 
03:59:28.469 --> 03:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh you
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the military has
 
03:59:33.590 --> 03:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
a cost-benefit analysis
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
from a resiliency standpoint is that
 
03:59:38.469 --> 03:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
something you you've looked at and
 
03:59:40.870 --> 03:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
does any of that make sense for for new
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire for non-military purpose but
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
still for resiliency thank you
 
03:59:48.070 --> 03:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome i i don't i don't think
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
it applies exactly because their needs
 
03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
and what their um
 
03:59:54.550 --> 03:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to protect against
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
is different than just outages and
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
resiliency like we are there for them
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's a national security issue as well
 
04:00:02.790 --> 04:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i think that cost benefit analysis
 
04:00:04.630 --> 04:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
would be very skewed differently than if
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
we would apply it here but i i could do
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
my best to see if i could find out what
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
that is i'm not sure that i'll be able
 
04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
to get all that info but i can do my
 
04:00:16.469 --> 04:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
best to find out what their analysis is
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
04:00:18.640 --> 04:00:19.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
okay

04:00:19.510 --> 04:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
next up is representative callie pitts
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you donna if i had a
 
04:00:26.479 --> 04:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
thank you donna if i had a
complex

04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
complex
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
maybe five buildings say hospital
 
04:00:29.840 --> 04:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
maybe five buildings say hospital
buildings

04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i said i do not want to be re i
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to be relying on the power
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
in an outage or whatever and i wanted to
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
go on my own
 
04:00:43.349 --> 04:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
and generate even my own internal power
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
see i i i i'm i'm having a problem here
 
04:00:52.880 --> 04:00:53.590 align:start position:0%
see i i i i'm i'm having a problem here
with

04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think i think the issue is for a micro
 
04:00:57.990 --> 04:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
grid is that it's for a
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
a geographic area and if you if it was
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
for in if it was for personal use i
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
think they probably might call that
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
self-generation even if it was temporary
 
04:01:08.469 --> 04:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
people who have generators during storms
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
don't think it would fit the category of
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
a microgrid but i would double check
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying to you
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
i will double check
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up but my follow-up would be so
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
we we worry about resiliency and i worry
 
04:01:21.279 --> 04:01:22.870 align:start position:0%
we we worry about resiliency and i worry
about

04:01:22.870 --> 04:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
04:01:32.229 --> 04:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
are there any situations where there are
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
places like that
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
where there are say complexes or
 
04:01:40.389 --> 04:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
industrial complexes that generate and
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
provide their own electricity without
 
04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
having the monica
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
micro microgrid i see your question now
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
um my my understanding is that there are
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
very many facilities in new york in
 
04:01:56.229 --> 04:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere actually but they that do have
 
04:01:57.750 --> 04:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
backup generation i can tell you every
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
source in manchester we have we have
 
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
we we have to keep running because we
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
no matter what so we do have backup
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
generation that flips on
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'm quite sure there are many critical
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals who have that
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
i know that there are some other
 
04:02:14.070 --> 04:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
businesses who have it i don't think
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's up to me to say who they are but i
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
do know there are some critical
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
businesses who have it
 
04:02:22.870 --> 04:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh additional questions for ms
 
04:02:22.880 --> 04:02:26.710 align:start position:0%
thank you uh additional questions for ms
gamache

04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative creation
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
question um so that last question made
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
me think of a different one is there
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
a different advantage to a microgrid in
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
terms of resiliency as opposed to just
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
having backup generation can you speak
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
to the the differences between those two
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
things yeah so the real i mean it set
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
aside what we were trying to do with unh
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
um but when the idea of microgrids first
 
04:02:54.150 --> 04:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
started to to gain popularity it was
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
because let's just say if you take the
 
04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
city of manchester and there's going to
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
be an outage and it's out for a while
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
enough that you're
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that people have a
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
place to go to get food gas shelter so
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
you might have a grocery store you would
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
find a geographic region where people
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
can go to a grocery store or mall to
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
stay warm
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
in between they can get gas to keep
 
04:03:16.630 --> 04:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
their car so if they had to get some
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
place they could get to the doctors and
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
get food and so the whole idea of a
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
microgrid was to make sure that there
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
was an area you wouldn't you wouldn't
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
have to worry about taking the entire it
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
would take too long to get the whole
 
04:03:28.630 --> 04:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
city up but if you could make sure that
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
there was a microgrid that you could
 
04:03:31.590 --> 04:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
turn on where you you knew that people
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
would be safe that would be the whole
 
04:03:32.960 --> 04:03:33.990 align:start position:0%
would be safe that would be the whole
purpose

04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:03:37.990 --> 04:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative notter thank you mr
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for taking the
 
04:03:51.670 --> 04:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
question you just got the wheels turning
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
because you said
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
what you just said
 
04:03:57.189 --> 04:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
made me wonder if there is a microgrid
 
04:03:57.199 --> 04:03:58.389 align:start position:0%
made me wonder if there is a microgrid
to

04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
to power up one little small area
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
would that
 
04:04:02.399 --> 04:04:03.429 align:start position:0%
would that
make

04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
getting the power back on everywhere
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
else delayed because they don't really
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
need to because they're okay for now
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't change
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
we have very strict
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
requirements about how we restore power
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
it would not change any of those
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
requirements it would just it would just
 
04:04:20.630 --> 04:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that that people had a place to
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
go while we continued to do what we did
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:04:28.319 --> 04:04:29.830 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
any

04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
last minute questions okay
 
04:04:34.469 --> 04:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts i'll
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the year but it was a
 
04:04:37.990 --> 04:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
few years ago when we had the ice storm
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
and there were people without power for
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
did we have
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
micro grids or these self-contained
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
areas then and have we proliferated them
 
04:04:50.560 --> 04:04:52.710 align:start position:0%
areas then and have we proliferated them
since

04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
so in the ice storm of 08 that was
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
really groundbreaking for us in so many
 
04:04:56.640 --> 04:04:57.830 align:start position:0%
really groundbreaking for us in so many
ways

04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
ways
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes it was 14 days in
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
some areas some areas we got on before
 
04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:05.189 align:start position:0%
some areas some areas we got on before
that

04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we had any microgrids in
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i don't think we have any
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
now isle of shoals is basically an
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
a microgrid
 
04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
but outside of that
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any at the time but the
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
one thing that we did do then
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't know i can't speak to how
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
that fits into what we do today but we
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
did try working with local officials
 
04:05:27.439 --> 04:05:28.469 align:start position:0%
did try working with local officials
to

04:05:28.469 --> 04:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
prioritize whether it was a school
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
in an area where people could go for
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
shelter because they could they could
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
they could um shelter more people than a
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
typical shelter and they could also
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
provide food and so we would prioritize
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
certain areas and at the time in 20 that
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
was 2008
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
i do remember that there were some key
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
officials some key legislators
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
governor's offices who wanted to come
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
and tour to make sure that we were
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
actually doing the right thing and that
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
it made sense and that we weren't
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
slowing up the rest of the restoration
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
by doing it so um and we had to and the
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
puc um did a a an intensive study of how
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
we there is a report that the puc put
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
out after that um you know lessons
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
learned what we could do better it was
 
04:06:12.150 --> 04:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
the first time and it sure was a it was
 
04:06:14.790 --> 04:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
a learning curve for all of us so um
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
there that that report i see if i i
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if i have any around
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
but and shortly right after that we had
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
snow tober so we went from the ice storm
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
of 08 then into snowtober where we were
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know just under two weeks
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
without power so they just started to
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
come rapidly but those lessons learned
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
brought us to the point where we
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
we are trying to look uh you know more
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
steadily at how we can find microgrids
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
that are less costly
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i have a quick question
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
is it true that an essential component
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
of a microgrid is
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
generation within the microgrid correct
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
you absolutely have to have generation
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
connecticut their focus has always been
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
on fuel cells for that generation
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
they've branched out from that as well
 
04:07:04.150 --> 04:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
but when connecticut first started
 
04:07:06.550 --> 04:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
looking at microgrids their fuel of
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
choice their generation of choice was
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
using fuel cells so yes absolutely they
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a source of generation
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
which was why unh was so perfect because
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
existing generation and then we just
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
augmented it
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have augmented it
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative plett did you have
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
another question i did
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh since restructuring uh distribution
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
companies are generally prohibited from
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
owning generation but are there
 
04:07:33.910 --> 04:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
exceptions for things like microgrids
 
04:07:38.070 --> 04:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
there is an exception
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
to that prohibition and it falls under
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
374 g i believe it's 374 g
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
and it
 
04:07:51.510 --> 04:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
for each utility you we can have it's
 
04:07:53.750 --> 04:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
like a clean energy um
 
04:07:53.760 --> 04:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
like a clean energy um
generation

04:07:55.110 --> 04:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
generation
 
04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
but it and whatever clean there's a
 
04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
certain criteria for clean energy and
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's up to a certain percent of our peak
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
load and i
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it is today but at the
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
time i think we saw it would be you know
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
generally up to like five megawatts i
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if that still exists today
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
when we first started talking about it
 
04:08:12.000 --> 04:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
when we first started talking about it
um

04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
but for that you still have to go to the
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and get
 
04:08:16.479 --> 04:08:17.590 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and get
approval

04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think that any util i could be
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
wrong but i think any utility has gotten
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
that approval yet i don't think anybody
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
i think only one utility has gone before
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
the puc for that approval i don't think
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a
 
04:08:33.600 --> 04:08:35.269 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a
oh

04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%

04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
all five of those bills are early bills
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
and so we have to complete them by
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
february 10th so we will
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
exec them on monday february 7th
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
starting at 2 o'clock
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
and prior to that at 1 o'clock we'll
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
finish the public hearing on house bill
 
04:09:55.840 --> 04:10:01.349 align:start position:0%
finish the public hearing on house bill

04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions about
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:13:11.830 --> 04:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:11.840 --> 04:15:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:59.840 --> 04:31:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
it being 1 30 i would like to call to
 
04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
order the public hearing on house bill
 
04:31:52.760 --> 04:31:54.389 align:start position:0%
order the public hearing on house bill
1250

04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
1250
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
a bill requiring the public utilities
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
commission to consider climate change
 
04:32:02.309 --> 04:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
and making rate-setting decisions
 
04:32:04.149 --> 04:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this bill is
 
04:32:07.030 --> 04:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher of merrimack
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
with representative oxenom
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
of solomon county as a co-sponsor
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
neither of them could appear apparently
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
for this hearing today so i have asked
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee to introduce this
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill representative mcgee the floor is
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
yours thank you mr chairman
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay so uh hb 1250 is as the chairman
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
stated it's a very simple bill in terms
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the letters
 
04:32:31.680 --> 04:32:33.189 align:start position:0%
of the letters
um

04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry in terms of the language that
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
is being added to the existing statute
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
on fixing of rates by the public
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
utilities commission and what it does is
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
it adds bolded language
 
04:32:47.110 --> 04:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
that basically asks that
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
if a decision
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
is up for consideration for rates fees
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
or just changes
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
in in the rate setting that they
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
in looking at that take into
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
consideration the impact
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
on of climate change it says on climate
 
04:33:05.359 --> 04:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
on of climate change it says on climate
change

04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually you know it's not my
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm not really sure why it says
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
after taking into consideration their
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
impact on climate change
 
04:33:17.119 --> 04:33:18.551 align:start position:0%
impact on climate change
okay

04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.830 --> 04:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
my i think my understanding from reading
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
the bill is
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what representative
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
gallagher's uh purpose was but i think
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
that the impetus may have been some of
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
the changes that have been requested in
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
the last
 
04:33:37.269 --> 04:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh oh is representative gallagher here
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your bill
 
04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
can i do that mr chairman
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
04:33:44.639 --> 04:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
great

04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:49.510 --> 04:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher i would remind
 
04:33:50.949 --> 04:33:50.959 align:start position:0%
you that you do need to fill out a pink
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
card eventually not right this second
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
but eventually
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
but you can take over the bill

i live in
 
04:34:25.680 --> 04:34:27.349 align:start position:0%
i live in
a

04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
pretty tall apartment building
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
in downtown concord and
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
our laundry room is on the top floor
 
04:34:37.750 --> 04:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
it has these really big windows in it so
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
whenever i go up to laundry
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
look out around the surrounding
 
04:34:41.920 --> 04:34:43.830 align:start position:0%
look out around the surrounding
countryside

04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
countryside
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
and to the south
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's this
 
04:34:50.949 --> 04:34:50.959 align:start position:0%
giant smokestack
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
from the power beau power plant
 
04:34:54.400 --> 04:34:56.310 align:start position:0%
from the power beau power plant
which

04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
especially this time of year
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
a giant smoke plume or steam plume
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
coming out of it and just whenever i see
 
04:35:09.439 --> 04:35:11.189 align:start position:0%
coming out of it and just whenever i see
that

04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm reminded about the
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions that
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
dirty power plants
 
04:35:20.080 --> 04:35:21.269 align:start position:0%
dirty power plants
put

04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
put
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
into the air
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
it um it makes me want to
 
04:35:30.470 --> 04:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
do something about that
 
04:35:30.480 --> 04:35:31.189 align:start position:0%
do something about that
so

04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
i've just been thinking about
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
what i can do about climate change
 
04:35:36.639 --> 04:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
what i can do about climate change
so

04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:37.760 --> 04:35:38.869 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:38.879 --> 04:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
um
as

04:35:40.470 --> 04:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
as a freshman representative i'm still
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
kind of new to this um
 
04:35:46.000 --> 04:35:47.269 align:start position:0%
kind of new to this um
and

04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:47.279 --> 04:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
what what bodies are there out there
 
04:35:57.119 --> 04:35:58.789 align:start position:0%
what what bodies are there out there
that

04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
regulate our electrical system the first
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
two that came to mind
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
were the site evaluation commission and
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission at first
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
i thought the former was part of the
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
latter but then i learned that it wasn't
 
04:36:17.349 --> 04:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
actually so i removed the part about the
 
04:36:19.349 --> 04:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee from the bill
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
that work might be worth
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
exploring later um
 
04:36:26.959 --> 04:36:29.029 align:start position:0%
exploring later um
so

04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:29.039 --> 04:36:30.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i want um
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
i want to do something
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
pretty simple at first um talking with
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
some other people
 
04:36:40.160 --> 04:36:41.670 align:start position:0%
some other people
um

04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
suggestions for
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
for getting into more details with
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
numbers and stuff but
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
um i wasn't quite sure how to
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
reconcile all of the
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions that i was receiving
 
04:37:04.160 --> 04:37:06.789 align:start position:0%
suggestions that i was receiving
so

04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
in the end i
 
04:37:08.639 --> 04:37:09.670 align:start position:0%
in the end i
just

04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
simple one-liner of
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
having the public utilities commission
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
take into consideration
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
the impact of climate change that
 
04:37:29.600 --> 04:37:31.029 align:start position:0%
the impact of climate change that
certain

04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.719 --> 04:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:37:36.390 --> 04:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
the idea is that
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
cleaner energy should be cheaper
 
04:37:41.520 --> 04:37:42.470 align:start position:0%
cleaner energy should be cheaper
and

04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
dirtier energy should be more expensive
 
04:37:46.639 --> 04:37:51.429 align:start position:0%
dirtier energy should be more expensive
and

04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:51.439 --> 04:37:52.869 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:52.879 --> 04:37:55.590 align:start position:0%
so
that's

04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's what i've got for
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
this legislation so far um
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
i i believe um
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
there may be some amendments
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
forthcoming but
 
04:38:06.879 --> 04:38:09.109 align:start position:0%
forthcoming but
um

04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i guess i'll take questions at
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative gallagher
 
04:38:16.000 --> 04:38:16.869 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative gallagher
for

04:38:16.869 --> 04:38:16.879 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
having the courage as a freshman to
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
come forward and
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill uh representative
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
harrington has a question for you uh
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh in reading the
 
04:38:31.039 --> 04:38:31.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh in reading the
bill

04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
that you you'll see in there obviously
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
the terms unjust and unreasonable i
 
04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned a number of times these two
 
04:38:40.390 --> 04:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
terms have years of uh
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
legal precedent establishing what that
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
means and there's all sorts of
 
04:38:45.750 --> 04:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
yardsticks that can be used to judge
 
04:38:45.760 --> 04:38:46.551 align:start position:0%
yardsticks that can be used to judge
that

04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
now this bill would bring in a totally
 
04:38:48.639 --> 04:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
now this bill would bring in a totally
new

04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh concept
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration their impact
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
on climate change i mean you could say
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
i consider this to have impact on
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
climate change is that sufficient
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here that tells the puc
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i say this as a former commissioner
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do other than
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
to consider it they can consider it by
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
saying well i read a report that
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
somebody said about that this will have
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
an impact on climate change but but what
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
do they do with it so it can you define
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit clearer as to what that
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
term taking into consideration of the
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
impact on climate change means and
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
explain how the puc would be able to
 
04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
implement it
 
04:39:27.680 --> 04:39:29.990 align:start position:0%
implement it
um

04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.000 --> 04:39:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
as for the
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
unjust and unreasonable parts i don't
 
04:39:41.590 --> 04:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
think this
 
04:39:41.600 --> 04:39:42.628 align:start position:0%
think this
really

04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
conflicts with that since
 
04:39:45.040 --> 04:39:47.110 align:start position:0%
conflicts with that since
um

04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:50.628 --> 04:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
climate change is often itself framed as
 
04:39:53.590 --> 04:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh justice issue um
 
04:39:54.550 --> 04:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:39:54.560 --> 04:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
you know
consigning

04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
consigning
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
consigning our future generations to a
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
worse world
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
a more uninhabitable world than we
 
04:40:06.550 --> 04:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
is being unjust to them
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i i think that's perfectly within
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
keeping with the um
 
04:40:13.760 --> 04:40:15.750 align:start position:0%
keeping with the um
existing

04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
unjust and unreasonable part
 
04:40:18.560 --> 04:40:23.910 align:start position:0%
unjust and unreasonable part
and

04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.920 --> 04:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
s4

04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
so as for um
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
how exactly um
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
the public utilities
 
04:40:40.470 --> 04:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
commission is supposed to
 
04:40:40.480 --> 04:40:42.310 align:start position:0%
commission is supposed to
um

04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
implement it um
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.070 --> 04:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
i i see this kind of just as a building
 
04:40:50.080 --> 04:40:51.030 align:start position:0%
i i see this kind of just as a building
block

04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
block
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
or a starting point for which the um
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
more complicated details of how exactly
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to determine
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.520 --> 04:41:12.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:15.030 --> 04:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
to how to calculate those
 
04:41:15.040 --> 04:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
to how to calculate those
um

04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:16.000 --> 04:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
you you can't really start
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
getting more into the details until you
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
have at least got like just the base
 
04:41:32.070 --> 04:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
okay any follow-up representative
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
no thank you mr jimmy representative
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
kelly pix is recognized
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for appearing
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
i've been in usc freshman
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
let i'm going to ask you if i'm
 
04:41:51.190 --> 04:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
interpreting what you're saying
 
04:41:51.200 --> 04:41:52.628 align:start position:0%
interpreting what you're saying
correctly

04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
and again i'm old so my brain doesn't
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
work so good
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
you are trying to what i believe that
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
you are trying to say is that if you
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
look if if somebody went in and looked
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
for a rate case
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
and the reason was that a polluting
 
04:42:08.878 --> 04:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
and the reason was that a polluting
plant

04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
plant
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
in your case you would think it would be
 
04:42:11.920 --> 04:42:13.350 align:start position:0%
in your case you would think it would be
bo

04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
bo
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
was costing too much
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
more much more to operate than they
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
thought it would and they're looking for
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
some compensation from the puc that the
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
puc should look into it and say
 
04:42:26.470 --> 04:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
that plant is contributing
 
04:42:28.230 --> 04:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
to pollution
 
04:42:30.550 --> 04:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore we are not going to give
 
04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
you the increase that you request or
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to minimize the increase
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
is that what you're trying to say
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
yeah that's um that sounds about right
 
04:42:40.798 --> 04:42:42.070 align:start position:0%
yeah that's um that sounds about right
yeah

04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:45.670 --> 04:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative platt has a question
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
question representative gallagher
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
are you aware since
 
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
the late 90s 2000 roughly that the
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
industry was deregulated so
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
utilities distribution utilities no
 
04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
longer own generation at all
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
the generation is not regulated
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
and that uh
 
04:43:13.030 --> 04:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
therefore the puc has no jurisdiction
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
over climate change because it's dealing
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
with transmission and distribution
 
04:43:16.798 --> 04:43:19.430 align:start position:0%
with transmission and distribution
solely

04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
solely
 
04:43:19.440 --> 04:43:21.350 align:start position:0%
solely
well

04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
all right if if that's the case then
 
04:43:24.798 --> 04:43:26.070 align:start position:0%
all right if if that's the case then
um

04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:26.080 --> 04:43:26.868 align:start position:0%
um
which

04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
which body is there that exists that
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
could do this because it seems like any
 
04:43:35.350 --> 04:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
other body get that gets suggested it
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
seems that that gets shut down shot down
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
as no that one can't do it either
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i think we've got to
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:48.080 --> 04:43:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
i i think climate change is really a
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
holistic issue that needs to be
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
thought about in terms of everything we
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:02.000 --> 04:44:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:44:03.670 --> 04:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
starting with the public utilities
 
04:44:05.360 --> 04:44:06.708 align:start position:0%
starting with the public utilities
commission

04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
is just a good place to start
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up no i think
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient okay thank you
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative samsich is recognized
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
i i totally sympathize with the
 
04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
sentiments you have
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
and while it's true that the public
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
utilities commission currently
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
does not take
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh climate change into consideration
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any reason why we
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't insist that they do
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
the question is how do we do it
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
for example if this bill said
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
look more favorably on rate setting when
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's a co2
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
reduction of emissions from a fuel or no
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
emissions from a fuel
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
that that would be a way of biasing
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
their decisions for rate setting when
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
there is no emission is that
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
i i think that's your goal right you're
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get the climate change
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
issue here and um yeah um and originally
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
like in terms of my own um my own
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
language that i was drafting it did it
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
did actually include language like that
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it just didn't
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
make it into what ols sent back to me so
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you'd like to help me
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
to make that change i would be open to
 
04:45:40.080 --> 04:45:41.910 align:start position:0%
to make that change i would be open to
it

04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up chairman thank you
 
04:45:43.760 --> 04:45:44.788 align:start position:0%
follow-up chairman thank you
uh

04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:44.798 --> 04:45:45.670 align:start position:0%
uh
and

04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh i i wonder if you're also aware that
 
04:45:52.230 --> 04:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
the bow plant that you're talking about
 
04:45:52.240 --> 04:45:54.150 align:start position:0%
the bow plant that you're talking about
operates

04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
operates
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
of just a tiny fraction of a percent of
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
the year
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
when it's when there's nothing else
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
available so to speak in the winter or
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
so that if in fact other sources come
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
that are less polluting
 
04:46:10.628 --> 04:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
there'd be no reason to turn it on at
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
all are you aware of that
 
04:46:12.958 --> 04:46:14.230 align:start position:0%
all are you aware of that
well

04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
wait could you repeat the last part of
 
04:46:16.868 --> 04:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
it again
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
easier to turn on at all or no reason to
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
turn on at all no what i'm saying is is
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
right now it is rarely turned on to
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
operate because there are other sources
 
04:46:27.040 --> 04:46:28.310 align:start position:0%
operate because there are other sources
and

04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
less emitting sources come online or
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
utilized there would be no reason for
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
that plant to turn on at all
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that um
 
04:46:39.920 --> 04:46:41.910 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that um
well

04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
i yeah i think
 
04:46:43.520 --> 04:46:44.708 align:start position:0%
i yeah i think
that

04:46:44.708 --> 04:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
04:46:47.120 --> 04:46:48.390 align:start position:0%
that's a good
example

04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:46:48.400 --> 04:46:49.270 align:start position:0%
example
of

04:46:49.270 --> 04:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
how it can't
 
04:46:53.190 --> 04:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes people will raise the
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
complaint of oh
 
04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
this might make
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
it more
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
it might make it more difficult for
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
us to have enough energy for everyone
 
04:47:06.070 --> 04:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
if uh we
 
04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
shut off power plants like bow but
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
since we barely ever use it anyways i i
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it really
 
04:47:16.390 --> 04:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh it really would cause
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
too much harm
 
04:47:17.760 --> 04:47:19.350 align:start position:0%
too much harm
to

04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:22.708 --> 04:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
make it operate even less
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you just as an fyi for you
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
station and a bow is generating 420
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
megawatts of power even as we speak
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
um anybody else have any questions for
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
well there's representative pementel go
 
04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you mr chairman and thank
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
you for uh
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
your work on this bill i'm i'm just
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
04:47:53.600 --> 04:47:54.550 align:start position:0%
wondering if
um

04:47:54.550 --> 04:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
going after
 
04:47:55.760 --> 04:47:57.590 align:start position:0%
going after
rates

04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
rates
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
as the
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
as the
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
place to be doing consideration as the
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
right place
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
having it be infrastructure or planning
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
04:48:17.200 --> 04:48:18.788 align:start position:0%
climate change
um

04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:18.798 --> 04:48:19.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't think it's the only place
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
where there could also be
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
there could also be other places where
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's worth taking this into
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
consideration as well
 
04:48:30.240 --> 04:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
consideration as well
but

04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
this is just one one of the many places
 
04:48:33.600 --> 04:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
this is just one one of the many places
where

04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
i want to start
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
i want to start with
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's just what i thought of first
 
04:48:40.400 --> 04:48:43.430 align:start position:0%
it's just what i thought of first
basically

04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.550 --> 04:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher representative
 
04:48:50.638 --> 04:48:53.110 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher representative
mann

04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:48:55.520 --> 04:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:59.670 --> 04:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
the phrase after taking into
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
consideration their impact on climate
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
change are you asking
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
the commission to um
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:16.628 --> 04:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
principles or decision criteria in terms
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
of what gets turned on and so on
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
are you are you suggesting that
 
04:49:23.120 --> 04:49:28.310 align:start position:0%
are you are you suggesting that
the

04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
since since
 
04:49:33.990 --> 04:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
electric generators
 
04:49:36.150 --> 04:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
charge a price for the electricity they
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
by essentially in
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
simplified way to buy electric power
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
from generators and
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
sell it to
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.160 --> 04:49:53.350 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
a way that perhaps representative man
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
could you pull your microphone a little
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
closer we're having trouble hearing
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
i thought you're going to thank you to
 
04:50:02.240 --> 04:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
i thought you're going to thank you to
stop

04:50:03.990 --> 04:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
stop
 
04:50:04.000 --> 04:50:08.550 align:start position:0%
stop
um

04:50:08.550 --> 04:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:10.628 --> 04:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that it's up to say
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission to
 
04:50:16.470 --> 04:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
handle this with rates for example if um
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
a polluting plant was forced to charge a
 
04:50:26.070 --> 04:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.080 --> 04:50:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
then people wouldn't then the utilities
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't buy power from that producer
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that all this
 
04:50:39.430 --> 04:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
consideration on how to make this
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually happen is you're leaving it up
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
to the public utilities commission i
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
guess that's my question
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
um at least as this bill
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
currently stands i would like to get
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
those criteria figure out
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
of how um and to help them with this job
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
of how to figure it out
 
04:50:57.600 --> 04:50:59.430 align:start position:0%
of how to figure it out
um

04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:01.030 --> 04:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
handled in
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment i believe
 
04:51:05.270 --> 04:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah somebody was actually sending to me
 
04:51:07.830 --> 04:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
last night but i managed to get by ols
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
in time to
 
04:51:09.280 --> 04:51:10.708 align:start position:0%
in time to
um

04:51:10.708 --> 04:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
get that turned into amendment an
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment yet um
 
04:51:15.520 --> 04:51:16.390 align:start position:0%
amendment yet um
so

04:51:16.390 --> 04:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:16.400 --> 04:51:18.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
but yeah if
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah until until we pass that i guess
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
they they would be able to figure that
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington has a
 
04:51:31.920 --> 04:51:33.590 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington has a
question

04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:51:34.868 --> 04:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question i think
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of confusion here
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to figure out exactly what
 
04:51:41.910 --> 04:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
you understand about how rates get set
 
04:51:43.350 --> 04:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
do you understand that
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
the puc sets electric rates on a lot of
 
04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
things a good portion of which is the
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
contracts that the utility brings to
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
them and says this is how we're going to
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
provide our power to our customers over
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
the next six months usually there's
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
multiple contracts it's broken up into
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
you know maybe 50 50 or maybe 35 35
 
04:52:02.798 --> 04:52:03.910 align:start position:0%
you know maybe 50 50 or maybe 35 35
whatever

04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:52:03.920 --> 04:52:04.708 align:start position:0%
whatever
and

04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
those contracts come in with a supplier
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
that the whether it be eversource or
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
unitel decides they're going to do based
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
on getting their someone who can meet
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
their load profile and then can also
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
give them the best price
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
and on a day-to-day basis that contract
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
is fulfilled by the supplier to the
 
04:52:26.470 --> 04:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
utility based on what's available in the
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
market for electricity and for example
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
as chairman votes just mentioned okay i
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
just want to know if do you understand
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
what i'm talking about on how the rates
 
04:52:35.910 --> 04:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
were set
 
04:52:35.920 --> 04:52:37.510 align:start position:0%
were set
um

04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:40.470 --> 04:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
i've i mean i i guess
 
04:52:40.480 --> 04:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
i've i mean i i guess
or

04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation i'm not
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
really sure how i'm supposed to reply to
 
04:52:46.560 --> 04:52:47.510 align:start position:0%
really sure how i'm supposed to reply to
it

04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:52:47.520 --> 04:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
it
um

04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's quite all right um it's a
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
complicated subject
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
are there any additional questions for
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:05.110 --> 04:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none and having no additional
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.990 --> 04:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative california i have a
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
question for the chair yes the uh
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
04:53:18.550 --> 04:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
said he got an amendment would you
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
advise him on how he can get an
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
amendment if he went through
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee who could
 
04:53:27.270 --> 04:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment for him could
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
you explain that to him i'm sure he
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand the process
 
04:53:35.030 --> 04:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative gallagher
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
now that you have introduced this bill
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
hb 1250 to our committee it no longer
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
belongs to you it's now our bill it
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
belongs to the committee
 
04:53:46.708 --> 04:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
therefore any amendments that get made
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
to this bill will have to be initiated
 
04:53:51.110 --> 04:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
by a member of this committee
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
now you can approach a member of the
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee and ask them to initiate an
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment on your behalf
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
and if they agree
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
they will do so but it will be their
 
04:54:01.200 --> 04:54:02.948 align:start position:0%
they will do so but it will be their
amendment

04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
you could potentially be a co-sponsor on
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment but it would be the
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
committee member's amendment yeah and uh
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
now that we don't typically excuse me
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
let me finish we don't typically
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
consider amendments during public
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
hearings we consider amendments either
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
during a subcommittee work session or
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
during an executive session
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
so the time to submit an amendment would
 
04:54:25.120 --> 04:54:27.590 align:start position:0%
so the time to submit an amendment would
be

04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
on the occasion of one of those
 
04:54:32.708 --> 04:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
other meetings
 
04:54:34.470 --> 04:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
right now we have no plans to do a
 
04:54:36.390 --> 04:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this bill but that could
 
04:54:36.400 --> 04:54:38.470 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this bill but that could
change

04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:54:40.550 --> 04:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
your first step
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm following through on
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts's request
 
04:54:45.750 --> 04:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
your first step would be to approach a
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
member of the committee to try to find
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
if find out if there's someone who would
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
be willing to submit an amendment on
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
your behalf
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
well um i believe i believe my
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor representative oxenham or i
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't see her here today but she's on
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
this committee isn't she
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
she is yes
 
04:55:04.470 --> 04:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah i'm i i know people on this
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee oh
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
i'll do that
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative mcwilliams for example
 
04:55:11.360 --> 04:55:12.550 align:start position:0%
representative mcwilliams for example
represents

04:55:12.550 --> 04:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
represents
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
the flow tarial that
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm in so
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to follow through on
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts's request
 
04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
that you fully understand how the
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
process works
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
04:55:28.400 --> 04:55:29.430 align:start position:0%
are there any
other

04:55:29.430 --> 04:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you um
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
i had thought quite a bit about this
 
04:55:38.310 --> 04:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
when i was asked to represent it and um
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that earlier today
 
04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion around the true cost
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
of a product being built in
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's a really
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
important point for us to think about in
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
it just struck me when i heard that
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
argument because
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
i think what's happening here is that
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
if we're not considering the
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
externalized costs
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
of how
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
climate change is something we're all
 
04:56:08.550 --> 04:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
going to be paying for especially maybe
 
04:56:10.150 --> 04:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
people of
 
04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher's generation
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think that that's the intent of the
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
bill is to try and figure out some way
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
to have the
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
the true cost incorporated into forms of
 
04:56:23.190 --> 04:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
generation that
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
that cost us more in the long run i
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comment uh
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you this is directed to
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
how does the puc have anything to do
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think the public utilities
 
04:56:44.470 --> 04:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
commission does have anything to do with
 
04:56:44.480 --> 04:56:46.470 align:start position:0%
commission does have anything to do with
generation

04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
generation
 
04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
but i think they oversee
 
04:56:49.680 --> 04:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
but i think they oversee
how

04:56:50.390 --> 04:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
generation is implemented in the market
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
and they have rate cases on various
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
types of generation and how they get
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
implemented and if they're not taking
 
04:57:00.550 --> 04:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
climate into consideration in those
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
conversations then you may get a
 
04:57:04.708 --> 04:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
different outcome in terms of
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
how the costs uh or benefits are
 
04:57:06.958 --> 04:57:08.310 align:start position:0%
how the costs uh or benefits are
allocated

04:57:08.310 --> 04:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
04:57:10.948 --> 04:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
so we seem to be straying into
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
the realm of a discussion about this
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
bill as opposed to a public hearing
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:57:20.948 --> 04:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
i would like to get a sense from the
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
committee would you like to
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
since we have a half hour roughly
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
left in before we have to tackle our
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
next bill would you like me to
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh reset not recess but end during this
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing and open a full committee
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill to have a
 
04:57:38.878 --> 04:57:40.390 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill to have a
discussion

04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
um just
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
for a heads up i have another bill that
 
04:57:48.550 --> 04:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing at uh
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
at 2 15 so i wouldn't be able to stay
 
04:57:52.948 --> 04:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
whole time your presence wouldn't be
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
required at a full committee work
 
04:57:58.230 --> 04:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
session anyway so
 
04:57:58.240 --> 04:57:59.270 align:start position:0%
session anyway so
thanks

04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay so all those who would like to have
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
a full committee work session on this
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
bill raise your hands please
 
04:58:06.638 --> 04:58:07.750 align:start position:0%
bill raise your hands please
one

04:58:07.750 --> 04:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
five six
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
seven all those who
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't really want to have a full
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee work session
 
04:58:20.080 --> 04:58:21.110 align:start position:0%
committee work session
one

04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
two three four five six seven
 
04:58:25.520 --> 04:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
two three four five six seven
eight

04:58:27.030 --> 04:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
eight
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
so it looks like eight to seven with me
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
abstaining for now
 
04:58:32.160 --> 04:58:33.110 align:start position:0%
abstaining for now
uh

04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:34.550 --> 04:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have a full committee
 
04:58:36.628 --> 04:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
work session nevertheless i'm going to
 
04:58:41.430 --> 04:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
all right representative creation has a
 
04:58:43.200 --> 04:58:44.550 align:start position:0%
all right representative creation has a
question

04:58:44.550 --> 04:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your indulgence chair um
 
04:58:49.110 --> 04:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
getting back to the question of
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
incorporating um
 
04:58:53.190 --> 04:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
the sort of externalities can you speak
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
to why
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
setting it in the rates by the puc would
 
04:58:59.830 --> 04:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
be better than other mechanisms that
 
04:59:03.270 --> 04:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
we've talked about like carbon taxes or
 
04:59:04.708 --> 04:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
other ways of incorporating those
 
04:59:04.718 --> 04:59:09.110 align:start position:0%
other ways of incorporating those
externalities

04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
um i mean if we can do one of those
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
other methods then create the um
 
04:59:14.718 --> 04:59:15.510 align:start position:0%
other methods then create the um
but

04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:59:17.270 --> 04:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
04:59:19.590 --> 04:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
one of those other methods necessarily
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
happening anytime soon
 
04:59:21.680 --> 04:59:22.830 align:start position:0%
happening anytime soon
so

04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:27.510 --> 04:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
um you know i i believe in
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
trying every method
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
and just doing do it doing what's what's
 
04:59:41.670 --> 04:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
possible to do
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
this is more yeah this is kind of just
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
like a backup in case some of the other
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
things you were discussing don't
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
04:59:57.440 --> 05:00:00.390 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
so

05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
we now do have another pink card so
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to thank
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%

department of energy here to
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
provide neutral testimony on house bill
 
05:00:45.280 --> 05:00:46.830 align:start position:0%
provide neutral testimony on house bill
1250

05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
1250
 
05:00:46.840 --> 05:00:48.550 align:start position:0%
1250
um

05:00:48.550 --> 05:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:50.070 --> 05:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
while the department doesn't take any
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
position on this uh we did want to note
 
05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
a number of uh
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
technical concerns
 
05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
um much in line with what representative
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
harrington had mentioned um
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
on lines nine eight and nine after
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration their impact
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
on climate change
 
05:01:08.708 --> 05:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
the bill does not specifically spell out
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
any criteria for the public utilities
 
05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
consider climate change are we looking
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
at reduction of greenhouse gases are we
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know any number of issues
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so if this bill were to proceed we'd
 
05:01:24.550 --> 05:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know we'd prefer that there'd be a
 
05:01:27.990 --> 05:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more of clarification there
 
05:01:30.868 --> 05:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
because the puc by and large is an
 
05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
economic regulator helping set electric
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
rates and that type of thing
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
they're not an environmental regulator
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
so if this were to proceed as is
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
the department respectfully anticipates
 
05:01:45.910 --> 05:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
that without any clear criteria there
 
05:01:48.150 --> 05:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
05:01:50.230 --> 05:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
very strong likelihood
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be additional staff
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for nearly every single
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
party and every single rate case so that
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
would mean department of energy we need
 
05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
to hire a consultant who's well-versed
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
in climate change um the utilities the
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
puc as well
 
05:02:04.718 --> 05:02:06.550 align:start position:0%
puc as well
um

05:02:06.550 --> 05:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
again without any clear criteria it
 
05:02:12.550 --> 05:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
might it might slow down the process of
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
of of
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
puc rate cases
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
some level but not you know abundant
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
consideration of climate change in
 
05:02:26.070 --> 05:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
um lease cost plans that are reviewed by
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission lease
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
cost energy planning is spelled out in
 
05:02:31.840 --> 05:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
cost energy planning is spelled out in

378
 
05:02:38.708 --> 05:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
colon 37 and it requires every electric
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
and natural gas utility to submit one of
 
05:02:42.550 --> 05:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
these plans and within those plans
 
05:02:44.470 --> 05:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's and i'm just
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
mentioning out of the statute
 
05:02:48.550 --> 05:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
um assessment of plan integration and
 
05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
impact on state compliance with the
 
05:02:51.910 --> 05:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
clean air act of 1990 and other
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
environmental laws
 
05:02:55.350 --> 05:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
an assessment of the plan's long and
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
short-term environmental
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
economic energy price and supply impact
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
what else here there's a
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
assessment of supply energy options
 
05:03:07.110 --> 05:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
including owned capacity market
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
procurements renewable energy and
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources so
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are two active lease cost plans uh
 
05:03:18.150 --> 05:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
being reviewed by the public utilities
 
05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
commission currently unitel has one
 
05:03:20.480 --> 05:03:21.670 align:start position:0%

for reference for the committee
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
that basically concludes my testimony uh
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to take any questions
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to answer them as best as
 
05:03:41.680 --> 05:03:43.510 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to answer them as best as
possible

05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative callie piss is recognized
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
my question was going to be do you
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
believe that the
 
05:03:54.550 --> 05:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission can set
 
05:03:54.560 --> 05:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission can set
criteria

05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
or that we can direct them to put in
 
05:04:00.070 --> 05:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
certain criteria
 
05:04:02.310 --> 05:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
even if they might have to
 
05:04:04.628 --> 05:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
hire an extra employee or the department
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
of energy would sure again
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's just based on the language in eight
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
eight and nine there just isn't a clear
 
05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
criteria as to what should be
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
considered for climate change i mean if
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
there was criteria put in i'm sure the
 
05:04:20.310 --> 05:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
department and the puc would
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
would uh certainly appreciate it but at
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
this time it's it's just quite broad in
 
05:04:25.520 --> 05:04:26.550 align:start position:0%
this time it's it's just quite broad in
general

05:04:26.550 --> 05:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:04:26.560 --> 05:04:27.590 align:start position:0%
general
follow-up

05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to follow up because i i i
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
believe at this point you know
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of testimony from the
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
department of energy and
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not very happy with it but we talk
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
about aesthetics
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
we don't say what aesthetic that you
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
can't block a cloud or you can't block a
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
mountain or
 
05:04:49.270 --> 05:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
so we do have
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
and that's for the puc that's for the
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
site evaluation we do have some broad
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
criteria that we do put in i'm not
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
speaking for or against this bill but
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that that if we wanted to do
 
05:05:02.160 --> 05:05:03.190 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that that if we wanted to do
this

05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
we could do it and there are other
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
examples in statute that have broad
 
05:05:07.600 --> 05:05:09.030 align:start position:0%
examples in statute that have broad
criteria

05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that sure and you
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
know referencing as you said the site
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee um in reviewing
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
aesthetics you know the
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee certainly
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
nailed down i think in rules you know
 
05:05:22.150 --> 05:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
certain things such as the stacks for
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
wind facility projects and that type of
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
thing but again in turn in terms of this
 
05:05:28.230 --> 05:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know at least having some additional
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
clarity i don't have the site evaluation
 
05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
committee statute in front of me but um
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know having some additional clarity
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of climate change would be
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
okay representative plett is recognized
 
05:05:44.470 --> 05:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
for questions thank you thank you for
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question you referred to the
 
05:05:48.550 --> 05:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
statute directing
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
lease cost plans
 
05:05:50.480 --> 05:05:51.350 align:start position:0%
lease cost plans
uh

05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
is that i mean the statute's still there
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
but is that somewhat archaic since the
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
industry has been deregulated so yes
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
class plans should only address
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution and not
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
generation correct and again i wasn't
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
referencing it as you know the best
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
alternative but it does consider in some
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
respects not entirely you know some
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
climate change aspects in terms of
 
05:06:16.150 --> 05:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
compliance with environmental laws and
 
05:06:22.830 --> 05:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
thing did you need a follow-up no
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative samsung is recognized
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
roberts for taking my
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that all energy
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
sources have
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
a variety of external costs that they
 
05:06:40.798 --> 05:06:42.070 align:start position:0%
a variety of external costs that they
might

05:06:42.070 --> 05:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:06:42.080 --> 05:06:43.510 align:start position:0%
might
create

05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
sure i mean i'm sure that energy
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
resource and some
 
05:06:49.350 --> 05:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
energy generation resources have
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
external costs but again it's not
 
05:06:51.600 --> 05:06:53.190 align:start position:0%
external costs but again it's not
anything

05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:06:53.200 --> 05:06:53.990 align:start position:0%
anything
that

05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:56.550 --> 05:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
the puc actively considers i guess
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
because they're largely focused on
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
distribution and
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
distribution rates and that type of
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
thing so you know the puc as has been
 
05:07:05.110 --> 05:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned don't get
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in generation review
 
05:07:08.788 --> 05:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing and the release
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
of carbon emissions so that type of
 
05:07:10.160 --> 05:07:11.270 align:start position:0%
of carbon emissions so that type of
thing

05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:07:11.280 --> 05:07:13.190 align:start position:0%
thing
follow-up

05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:07:14.718 --> 05:07:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
but

05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
that is exactly my point so who does
 
05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
consider those external costs and who
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
puts them into the rates yeah i mean
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's currently in
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
statute right now that'd be a decision
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.310 --> 05:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
okay any additional questions for mr
 
05:07:34.718 --> 05:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
okay any additional questions for mr
roberge

05:07:37.430 --> 05:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
roberge
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:07:43.270 --> 05:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:07:45.670 --> 05:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
as far as how they get into rates
 
05:07:45.680 --> 05:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
as far as how they get into rates
um

05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
would you agree that for example we've
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
talked about the bow power plant here
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
today they have a scrubber on it that
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
costs uh well over 400 million dollars
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
and there's other pollution control
 
05:08:00.070 --> 05:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
devices on there so would you agree that
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
their cost is uh impacted greatly by the
 
05:08:04.788 --> 05:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
pollution controls they have and that's
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
how those costs get put into rates
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:11.760 --> 05:08:12.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
any more questions for mr roberge
 
05:08:19.270 --> 05:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you for your uh
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much

okay it's 2 30 and time to resume our
 
05:32:02.548 --> 05:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
activity here
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
so i would like to open the public
 
05:32:09.990 --> 05:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
requiring notification to renewable
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
energy customer generators of issues
 
05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
related to renewable energy credits
 
05:32:21.030 --> 05:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to introduce the prime sponsor
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
of this bill representative oxenam
 
05:32:26.788 --> 05:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
and representative oxenham would like to

make a statement before she begins her
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
formal testimony on this bill
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair thank
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
you colleagues for your attention
 
05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
i have filed a conflict of interest with
 
05:32:37.760 --> 05:32:38.948 align:start position:0%
i have filed a conflict of interest with
the

05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:40.868 --> 05:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services on this
 
05:32:43.110 --> 05:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill and i am now making a verbal
 
05:32:43.120 --> 05:32:44.830 align:start position:0%
bill and i am now making a verbal
disclosure

05:32:44.830 --> 05:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
05:32:44.840 --> 05:32:46.788 align:start position:0%
disclosure
that

05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
this bill could affect
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
a property claim
 
05:32:54.390 --> 05:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
i am a renewable energy owner customer
 
05:32:54.400 --> 05:32:55.670 align:start position:0%
i am a renewable energy owner customer
generator

05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
generator
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
having a cessation of wreck sweeping
 
05:33:02.470 --> 05:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
would restore my rights to my property
 
05:33:05.750 --> 05:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
it would stop the taking of the property
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
and that could be considered a financial
 
05:33:08.240 --> 05:33:09.270 align:start position:0%
and that could be considered a financial
interest

05:33:09.270 --> 05:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
so as a serving member of this committee
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
and in consideration of the bill before
 
05:33:15.750 --> 05:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
us i am
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
verbally acknowledging that i have a
 
05:33:19.350 --> 05:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
special interest
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
and i am doing so verbally it is also
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
possible that if we are unable
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
to rectify this issue legislatively that
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
there may be a legal action in which i
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
would be a party and there also i might
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
have a financial interest to disclose
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for making that statement can
 
05:33:41.990 --> 05:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
i ask a quick question do you know if
 
05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
you will have to recuse yourself from
 
05:33:47.510 --> 05:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
executive session on this bill
 
05:33:50.708 --> 05:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
i spoke with mr rich lambert on that
 
05:33:53.190 --> 05:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
matter and it's a little unclear because
 
05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
of this issue of the cessation of a
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
practice which is now
 
05:33:58.320 --> 05:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
practice which is now
ongoing

05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
constituting a financial interest so uh
 
05:34:02.958 --> 05:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
constituting a financial interest so uh
i

05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:34:05.830 --> 05:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
could i simply say that it's under i'm
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
taking that under advisement looking
 
05:34:09.750 --> 05:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
into it and i will make sure before the
 
05:34:12.150 --> 05:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
executive session that that is resolved
 
05:34:13.990 --> 05:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
 
05:34:14.000 --> 05:34:14.868 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
so

05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
please give us your testimony on this
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
um an amendment has been passed out
 
05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
and i would just like to explain why
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
there is both a bill and an amendment
 
05:34:29.270 --> 05:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
at the time of our lsr window i was
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
under the impression that we could not
 
05:34:37.110 --> 05:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
file legislation that would be
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
substantively similar to something that
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
came up last year
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
but since this bill never made it to the
 
05:34:45.750 --> 05:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
floor and no action was taken on it that
 
05:34:48.150 --> 05:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
provision actually didn't apply
 
05:34:51.270 --> 05:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
so the bill before you is is convoluted
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
and difficult
 
05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's presented as a consumer
 
05:34:57.190 --> 05:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
notification bill and so it has all that
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
legalistic language it's about as
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
interesting as reading a credit card
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
small print
 
05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
but it
 
05:35:06.548 --> 05:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
tries to accomplish the same thing as
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amendment is simply
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
very straightforward let's eliminate the
 
05:35:16.150 --> 05:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
provision that creates the problem
 
05:35:19.030 --> 05:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
so i will be speaking to
 
05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
that goal
 
05:35:22.948 --> 05:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
it's not specific either to the
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment or to the bill since they both
 
05:35:28.390 --> 05:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
try to accomplish the goal of stopping
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
an unconstitutional taking of property
 
05:35:36.070 --> 05:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
so the fundamental purpose of hb 1645
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
is to put an end to an unconstitutional
 
05:35:44.470 --> 05:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
taking of property by the state and the
 
05:35:47.110 --> 05:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
transfer of that property to private
 
05:35:47.120 --> 05:35:48.470 align:start position:0%
transfer of that property to private
corporations

05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
05:35:51.030 --> 05:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
both new hampshire's public utilities
 
05:35:53.830 --> 05:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
and also out-of-state multi-billion
 
05:35:56.390 --> 05:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
dollar corporations like constellation
 
05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
energy and direct energy
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
a practice that is going on without the
 
05:36:03.670 --> 05:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge or consent of new hampshire
 
05:36:05.830 --> 05:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
residents or businesses
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
and without any compensation for the
 
05:36:08.558 --> 05:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
and without any compensation for the
taking

05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
taking
 
05:36:13.350 --> 05:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
first rec sweeping is a taking because
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
electricity providers are enabled to use
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
customer generators property for their
 
05:36:20.948 --> 05:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
own purposes
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
and it is a taking because in so doing
 
05:36:26.070 --> 05:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
it prevents the customer generator
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
from using their property in their own
 
05:36:28.878 --> 05:36:31.030 align:start position:0%
from using their property in their own
interest

05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
the property taken
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
is the renewable attributes of the
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
electricity that customer generators
 
05:36:37.680 --> 05:36:39.750 align:start position:0%
electricity that customer generators
produce

05:36:39.750 --> 05:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
produce
 
05:36:42.390 --> 05:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are the essence of
 
05:36:45.270 --> 05:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
what makes renewable energy renewable
 
05:36:47.830 --> 05:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
and to be clear they are created at the
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
very moment the electricity is generated
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
they can be separated from the physical
 
05:36:53.760 --> 05:36:55.350 align:start position:0%
they can be separated from the physical
electricity

05:36:55.350 --> 05:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:36:57.350 --> 05:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
and like any kind of property they can
 
05:37:01.110 --> 05:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
be bought sold or transferred
 
05:37:03.750 --> 05:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
if you separate the renewable attributes
 
05:37:05.670 --> 05:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
from the electricity produced by a
 
05:37:07.590 --> 05:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
renewable source
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
it is no longer renewable energy
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
the ftc says it is now
 
05:37:15.120 --> 05:37:16.150 align:start position:0%
the ftc says it is now
null

05:37:16.150 --> 05:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
null
 
05:37:16.160 --> 05:37:18.868 align:start position:0%
null
electricity

05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:37:20.230 --> 05:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
so to be clear
 
05:37:22.390 --> 05:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are the property
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
interest that wrecks
 
05:37:27.750 --> 05:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
represent and convey
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire statutes
 
05:37:32.230 --> 05:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
state and federal case law
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
federal guidance
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
and multiple new england pucs make it
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
that renewable attributes exist
 
05:37:43.190 --> 05:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they are ever
 
05:37:46.070 --> 05:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
registered as wrecks
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
and may i just say as an aside sometimes
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
statutes refer to rex as renewable
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
energy certificates and sometimes they
 
05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
refer to them as renewable energy
 
05:37:55.120 --> 05:37:57.670 align:start position:0%
refer to them as renewable energy
credits

05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's rec sweeping section
 
05:37:59.760 --> 05:38:01.030 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's rec sweeping section
masks

05:38:01.030 --> 05:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
masks
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying reality of this taking
 
05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
by referring to it as crediting
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
but in practice rec sweeping strips the
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes from customer
 
05:38:14.070 --> 05:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
generators electricity production
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
and transfers it to electricity
 
05:38:15.920 --> 05:38:17.270 align:start position:0%
and transfers it to electricity
providers

05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:38:19.750 --> 05:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
both public utilities and private
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
corporations in basically a 50 50 split
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
and they use them
 
05:38:32.548 --> 05:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
for their rps compliance requirements
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
so in doing this the state is taking the
 
05:38:35.360 --> 05:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
so in doing this the state is taking the
property

05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
they are transferring the right to use
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
it to private corporations
 
05:38:43.590 --> 05:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
and all the renewable attributes which
 
05:38:46.470 --> 05:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
we commonly but misleadingly often refer
 
05:38:47.910 --> 05:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
to as rex
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
all the renewable attributes used for
 
05:38:51.990 --> 05:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
rps compliance
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
legally become part of the electricity
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the providers supply
 
05:39:02.830 --> 05:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
and rps anti-double counting provisions
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
prohibit anyone else from claiming that
 
05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
they also use those same renewable
 
05:39:09.760 --> 05:39:10.948 align:start position:0%
they also use those same renewable
attributes

05:39:10.948 --> 05:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
attributes
 
05:39:13.110 --> 05:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
and claiming them as something they
 
05:39:16.230 --> 05:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
produce and consume
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
federal law likewise prohibits customer
 
05:39:21.190 --> 05:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
generators from claiming to use the
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
renewable energy they produce
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
if that renewable energy is being
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
counted toward a state rps mandate
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
again this is an anti-double counting
 
05:39:35.430 --> 05:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
provision otherwise you would be
 
05:39:37.030 --> 05:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
believing that you had double the
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy being produced in the
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
state then you do
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to any action affecting
 
05:39:47.350 --> 05:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
commerce a business that claims to be a
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
hundred percent renewably powered
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
if they've sold their wrecks they are in
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
violation of the statute and can be
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
prosecuted i believe it's a ten thousand
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
dollar a day
 
05:40:00.948 --> 05:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
fine for any business that would find
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
itself unknowingly in this situation
 
05:40:07.270 --> 05:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
so what are the key property rights that
 
05:40:09.750 --> 05:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
the consumer generator loses as the
 
05:40:12.070 --> 05:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
result of this unconstitutional taking
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
of their property
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
first it renders null and void their
 
05:40:16.798 --> 05:40:18.150 align:start position:0%
first it renders null and void their
intention

05:40:18.150 --> 05:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
intention
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
in in investing in renewable energy if
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
they wanted to move off of fossil fuels
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to reduce their carbon
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
footprint if they just wanted to live
 
05:40:30.150 --> 05:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
less destructively on the planet
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
that has been rendered null and void by
 
05:40:34.948 --> 05:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
the taking
 
05:40:34.958 --> 05:40:36.628 align:start position:0%
the taking
secondly

05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
it subverts their desire to create more
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
renewable energy additional to the
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
minimum requirement mandated by the
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
state under the rps
 
05:40:49.830 --> 05:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
final point
 
05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
to add insult to injury
 
05:40:55.270 --> 05:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
by producing this energy which they did
 
05:40:57.430 --> 05:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
to meet their own needs
 
05:41:00.548 --> 05:41:00.558 align:start position:0%
they reduce the total pool of energy
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
that is subject to rps compliance
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
and so that by by producing renewable
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
energy less money less electricity has
 
05:41:12.470 --> 05:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be purchased so the total pool of
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
energy that's subject to compliance has
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
been reduced
 
05:41:18.548 --> 05:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
and then they get to credit these
 
05:41:20.548 --> 05:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
swept wrecks
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
against that already reduced requirement
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
so they've had two two dips at
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
actually subverting the original
 
05:41:33.990 --> 05:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of having a renewable
 
05:41:36.310 --> 05:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state law especially
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
recognizes that increasing renewable
 
05:41:42.470 --> 05:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
energy generation is in the public
 
05:41:42.480 --> 05:41:43.590 align:start position:0%
energy generation is in the public
interest

05:41:43.590 --> 05:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:41:47.350 --> 05:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
rsa 362 f colon 1 states quote
 
05:41:49.270 --> 05:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
it is therefore in the public interest
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
to stimulate investment in low emission
 
05:41:54.310 --> 05:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generation technologies
 
05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
in new england and in particular in new
 
05:41:56.958 --> 05:41:58.470 align:start position:0%
in new england and in particular in new
hampshire

05:41:58.470 --> 05:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
the provision this bill seeks to remove
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
is a poison pill that was introduced
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
subsequently to the creation of the
 
05:42:05.680 --> 05:42:07.110 align:start position:0%
subsequently to the creation of the
statute

05:42:07.110 --> 05:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
and it actively works against the
 
05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
original legislative intent of the
 
05:42:11.600 --> 05:42:12.868 align:start position:0%
original legislative intent of the
statute

05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
it is an unconstitutional taking of
 
05:42:18.070 --> 05:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses property
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
by a stealth process accomplished out of
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
sight and without the knowledge of many
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
of those at harms
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
we can do the right thing
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
and remove this pernicious policy by
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
legislative action
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
or we can allow it to stand where it
 
05:42:36.470 --> 05:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
will be subject to legal challenge
 
05:42:38.470 --> 05:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
potentially costing the state and our
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in excess of 10 million
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in legal costs
 
05:42:45.910 --> 05:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
i ask you to take the first choice
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
support the amendment
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
and let's remove this provision from
 
05:42:49.520 --> 05:42:51.430 align:start position:0%
and let's remove this provision from
statute

05:42:51.430 --> 05:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:56.548 --> 05:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxidom
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
all right do we have questions for
 
05:43:00.628 --> 05:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom representative
 
05:43:04.150 --> 05:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
platt yes uh thank you for your
 
05:43:05.910 --> 05:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
statement do you have it in written form
 
05:43:07.030 --> 05:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
you can submit
 
05:43:08.708 --> 05:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
it it's a little scratched up i will
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
submit it electronically to you this
 
05:43:13.270 --> 05:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon when i get home thank you
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
every time i read it i you know
 
05:43:17.910 --> 05:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:43:20.708 --> 05:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question just so i'm clear
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
these uh swept up wrecks are these the
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
wrecks that we changed the amount from i
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
think was last year where it was a 20
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
that considered a 20 capacity factor
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
down to a 13 and a half percent is that
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
the ones we're referring to it is and
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
that was a positive move in changing
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
that because the there was an
 
05:43:41.760 --> 05:43:43.270 align:start position:0%
that because the there was an
exaggerated

05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
exaggerated
 
05:43:45.590 --> 05:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
value attached to each of those wrecks
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
when they were falsely considered to be
 
05:43:51.350 --> 05:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
producing at the rate of 20 percent
 
05:43:54.548 --> 05:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman follow up okay so
 
05:43:56.948 --> 05:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
the people that are not registering
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
their wrecks and they're now we're
 
05:44:00.548 --> 05:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
working under the assumption that
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's a thirteen and a half percent
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
capacity factor for whatever their size
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
of the solar array is
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
would most of these people have to
 
05:44:11.430 --> 05:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
install uh fairly expensive uh measuring
 
05:44:13.590 --> 05:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
equipment in order to comply with the
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
requirements so they could actually sell
 
05:44:20.230 --> 05:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:22.310 --> 05:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
you you caught me there at the very end
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
by going to sell their wrecks because
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's different than what i thought you
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
were going to go for which was to retain
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
their wreck so so let me
 
05:44:33.350 --> 05:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
back up and and answer well let me
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
clarify i mean if they say retain with
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
05:44:38.628 --> 05:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
if they're not going to do anything with
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
them at all then they wouldn't need the
 
05:44:43.750 --> 05:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
measuring equipment but if they were
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
going to either sell them to the utility
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
or sell them on the market they would
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
need additional instrumentation is that
 
05:44:50.400 --> 05:44:53.510 align:start position:0%
need additional instrumentation is that
correct

05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
there was again there was a recent
 
05:44:58.548 --> 05:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
provision change that has made it easier
 
05:44:58.558 --> 05:44:59.590 align:start position:0%
provision change that has made it easier
um

05:44:59.590 --> 05:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:02.070 --> 05:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
in in general anybody who's had their
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
system for a while is going to have to
 
05:45:04.080 --> 05:45:05.270 align:start position:0%
system for a while is going to have to
create

05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
to do exactly what you said and have an
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
auditor and a monitor and such things so
 
05:45:13.270 --> 05:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
that you know first of all people don't
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
know what's happening that they need to
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
take those steps
 
05:45:17.040 --> 05:45:18.150 align:start position:0%
take those steps
um

05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
and if they don't want to be engaged in
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
a sale
 
05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't think that they needed to
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
so the the notion here under the
 
05:45:29.110 --> 05:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
original bill was to to
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
have them informed that this is going on
 
05:45:34.390 --> 05:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
and that there is the possibility of
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
registering and retaining um
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
but that's not included in the amended
 
05:45:40.080 --> 05:45:41.190 align:start position:0%
but that's not included in the amended
bill

05:45:41.190 --> 05:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
no the amended bill simply removes the
 
05:45:44.470 --> 05:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
provision so you don't have to inform
 
05:45:45.990 --> 05:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
people that they're being harmed thank
 
05:45:46.000 --> 05:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
people that they're being harmed thank
you

05:45:47.990 --> 05:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:45:49.350 --> 05:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:45:51.670 --> 05:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
additional questions for
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
05:45:59.430 --> 05:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:01.430 --> 05:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative oxnghem i just want to
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:46:07.350 --> 05:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
recap if i understand correctly the
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
process here and
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
i just want you to confirm that that's
 
05:46:12.390 --> 05:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's basically my query here
 
05:46:17.990 --> 05:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
so basically if i have an installed
 
05:46:19.830 --> 05:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
solar array
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm not interested because i don't
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
want to get into the complications of
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring or
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
selling or all that stuff i don't want
 
05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
to get into that i just like to generate
 
05:46:30.628 --> 05:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
my own energy
 
05:46:33.670 --> 05:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i have this collector and
 
05:46:36.390 --> 05:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
so if i don't do anything to it in the
 
05:46:37.910 --> 05:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
way of uh
 
05:46:40.470 --> 05:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
marketing it somehow or monetizing it
 
05:46:40.480 --> 05:46:41.510 align:start position:0%
marketing it somehow or monetizing it
somehow

05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
05:46:43.350 --> 05:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh currently
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
my utility can claim that energy for its
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
portion of its requirement
 
05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
to generate some solar energy
 
05:46:56.070 --> 05:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
they can say that's that's ours
 
05:46:57.990 --> 05:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we're going to use that to credit it
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
against our obligations
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to notify me that
 
05:47:03.990 --> 05:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're using my energy or they don't
 
05:47:06.310 --> 05:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
have to compensate me in any way for it
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct is that the current
 
05:47:08.080 --> 05:47:09.030 align:start position:0%
is that correct is that the current
system

05:47:09.030 --> 05:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
very close
 
05:47:13.430 --> 05:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
compensate for using it it they've taken
 
05:47:16.230 --> 05:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
it they're not just you know what
 
05:47:18.628 --> 05:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
prop a property right what is inherent
 
05:47:20.708 --> 05:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
in owning property is that you have the
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
right to dispose of it and you have an
 
05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
exclusive right to dispose of it someone
 
05:47:28.948 --> 05:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
else is granted the right to use it
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
you no longer have the right to use it
 
05:47:33.750 --> 05:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
you cannot even claim that you are
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
producing and consuming it at home
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
and and a final thing which i think
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
was raised there
 
05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
is the point that um
 
05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
because the capacity factor is is being
 
05:47:51.750 --> 05:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
put against the
 
05:47:51.760 --> 05:47:53.830 align:start position:0%
put against the
um

05:47:53.830 --> 05:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:01.430 --> 05:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's not simple
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm having something called
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think i can get it wait a
 
05:48:05.040 --> 05:48:07.430 align:start position:0%
i think i think i can get it wait a
second

05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:09.990 --> 05:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
they are not only taking the excess
 
05:48:13.590 --> 05:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
energy they are taking also
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
a value the property to what you
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
self-consumed because that the they are
 
05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
applying this capacity factor to the
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
size of your array and an assumption
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
about the the days of sun if it's a
 
05:48:31.110 --> 05:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
solar system so because the assumption
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
is based on your total production
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
you're not only losing the claim to what
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
is put back out onto the grid you are
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
losing also the property right in even
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
what you
 
05:48:45.750 --> 05:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
have self-consumed behind the meter
 
05:48:48.150 --> 05:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
a question thank you mr chair thank you
 
05:48:54.470 --> 05:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i apologize for
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
coming in late during your presentation
 
05:48:56.400 --> 05:48:57.110 align:start position:0%
coming in late during your presentation
so

05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:00.150 --> 05:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'll ask this question uh i know that
 
05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced is here and i'm
 
05:49:04.230 --> 05:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
assuming you were speaking a little bit
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
about the amendment that you would like
 
05:49:08.788 --> 05:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
to be introduced or you know taken over
 
05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
in either case
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
if this was enacted
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
would this cost the ratepayer any more
 
05:49:15.360 --> 05:49:17.110 align:start position:0%
would this cost the ratepayer any more
money

05:49:17.110 --> 05:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:49:24.548 --> 05:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:25.910 --> 05:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
both the bill
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:29.280 --> 05:49:30.948 align:start position:0%
 
are

05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:49:33.030 --> 05:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
aimed at accomplishing the same thing
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
which is to stop this this process
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
um so that that was to settle your first
 
05:49:39.120 --> 05:49:40.708 align:start position:0%
um so that that was to settle your first
question

05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
the second question was about the effect
 
05:49:44.548 --> 05:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
on the rate payers
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
last year when we discussed this bill i
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
remember that it was mentioned
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
by someone
 
05:49:50.798 --> 05:49:51.990 align:start position:0%
by someone
that

05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:49:54.868 --> 05:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
this saves the rate payers money
 
05:49:58.788 --> 05:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
in fact the electricity providers
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
are not simply our public utilities they
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
are also
 
05:50:03.040 --> 05:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
are also
large

05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
large
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar outside
 
05:50:08.788 --> 05:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
corporations so that the property
 
05:50:08.798 --> 05:50:09.910 align:start position:0%
corporations so that the property
interests

05:50:09.910 --> 05:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
interests
 
05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire residents and
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
businesses are being transferred by the
 
05:50:14.718 --> 05:50:15.670 align:start position:0%
businesses are being transferred by the
state

05:50:15.670 --> 05:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:50:15.680 --> 05:50:16.390 align:start position:0%
state
to

05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:50:16.400 --> 05:50:17.830 align:start position:0%
to
out-of-state

05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
05:50:20.390 --> 05:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
private corporations and as i don't know
 
05:50:21.670 --> 05:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
if you were here when i said it's about
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
50 50. i think it's 48 of the total pool
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
goes to the competitive suppliers and
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
about 52 rounded off
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
goes to the utilities so for the
 
05:50:33.600 --> 05:50:35.270 align:start position:0%
goes to the utilities so for the
utilities

05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
they are required to pass on any savings
 
05:50:41.670 --> 05:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
to their the ratepayers for the
 
05:50:44.150 --> 05:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers who you know have
 
05:50:46.708 --> 05:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely no contact with the customer
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
generators and no interest in them or
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
our ratepayers
 
05:50:53.350 --> 05:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's simply cream it's just excess
 
05:50:57.430 --> 05:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up
 
05:50:59.200 --> 05:51:00.070 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up
um

05:51:00.070 --> 05:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:01.350 --> 05:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
since you mentioned it just for
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
clarification uh the bill that you
 
05:51:06.390 --> 05:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
referred to last year was that hp 396
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
the one that was i tailed in this
 
05:51:09.910 --> 05:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
committee last year is that the one you
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
were referring to
 
05:51:13.590 --> 05:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
when you spoke about the bill that was
 
05:51:19.430 --> 05:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:21.190 --> 05:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
i was under the impression that that
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill was one of the ones that was not
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
considered on the floor when we had that
 
05:51:27.990 --> 05:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
marathon session that ran late
 
05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
but you may if if you are correct that
 
05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
it was itled in committee
 
05:51:33.920 --> 05:51:34.868 align:start position:0%
it was itled in committee
then

05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:51:34.878 --> 05:51:35.670 align:start position:0%
then
that

05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
then we
 
05:51:38.150 --> 05:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to kill fight myself
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's all well we would we we will
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
definitely find out before we get to our
 
05:51:46.390 --> 05:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
work session if if in fact that was what
 
05:51:46.400 --> 05:51:47.670 align:start position:0%
work session if if in fact that was what
happened

05:51:47.670 --> 05:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:51:50.230 --> 05:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes since i made the motion on the floor
 
05:51:54.310 --> 05:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
i know for a fact that hb 396 was itled
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
by this committee but then it was tabled
 
05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
05:52:01.430 --> 05:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the house rules say that a bill
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's been tabled
 
05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
has not been
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
acted upon acted upon by the house
 
05:52:10.150 --> 05:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
therefore it can be brought back again
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
the following year so that that is the
 
05:52:16.948 --> 05:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
uh parliamentary situation with that
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
bill i think uh
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
representatives thomas question was
 
05:52:25.110 --> 05:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
it has the same goal
 
05:52:30.390 --> 05:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
it is not literally the same bill no
 
05:52:32.470 --> 05:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's um you know if you compare the two
 
05:52:33.670 --> 05:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
texts they
 
05:52:35.510 --> 05:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know they are different
 
05:52:37.990 --> 05:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you after a year of legal
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
research and talking with lawyers from
 
05:52:42.230 --> 05:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
around the country on this issue it's a
 
05:52:43.350 --> 05:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
better bill
 
05:52:45.750 --> 05:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
than the one we had last year
 
05:52:47.510 --> 05:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:53.350 --> 05:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get things straight in my
 
05:52:55.270 --> 05:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
own mind
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
most of the energy and correct me if i'm
 
05:53:01.030 --> 05:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
wrongly most of the energy
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we are talking about has already
 
05:53:03.600 --> 05:53:04.628 align:start position:0%
that we are talking about has already
been

05:53:04.628 --> 05:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
net metered
 
05:53:08.708 --> 05:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
to the company
 
05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
and the company has indeed bought it by
 
05:53:12.320 --> 05:53:14.310 align:start position:0%
and the company has indeed bought it by
paying

05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
paying
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
a credit back to the customer is that
 
05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
correct uh no one in fact there's a
 
05:53:22.948 --> 05:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
provision that says that that the two um
 
05:53:24.470 --> 05:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
the one cannot be
 
05:53:26.390 --> 05:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
credited the other there are people who
 
05:53:28.470 --> 05:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
have their wrecks swept who are net
 
05:53:28.480 --> 05:53:29.750 align:start position:0%
have their wrecks swept who are net
metered

05:53:29.750 --> 05:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
metered
 
05:53:29.760 --> 05:53:30.548 align:start position:0%
metered
who

05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
receive no rebate
 
05:53:35.590 --> 05:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
there are people who did receive rebates
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
who are not swept
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
it it's the the two the two are not um
 
05:53:45.110 --> 05:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
they overlap but they're not um you know
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
convergent sets you know they're not
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're not the same thing
 
05:53:54.150 --> 05:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:56.150 --> 05:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
what is the difference
 
05:53:56.160 --> 05:53:57.670 align:start position:0%
what is the difference
between

05:53:57.670 --> 05:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
sweeping wrecks
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
and aggregating reps
 
05:54:01.360 --> 05:54:07.070 align:start position:0%
and aggregating reps
rex

05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:09.990 --> 05:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
aggregating rex are you thinking about
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about
 
05:54:16.628 --> 05:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
may i clap
 
05:54:18.070 --> 05:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead i'm thinking about a
 
05:54:20.150 --> 05:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
discussion we had several years ago in
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
this committee about
 
05:54:24.470 --> 05:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
letting the
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
utilities ag
 
05:54:29.190 --> 05:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
in essence what you call sweeping put
 
05:54:30.788 --> 05:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
the wrecks together because there were
 
05:54:32.470 --> 05:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
many people who didn't want to bother
 
05:54:32.480 --> 05:54:33.590 align:start position:0%
many people who didn't want to bother
with

05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
the paperwork etc and we called that
 
05:54:39.750 --> 05:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
aggregation i believe i may be very
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
confused but that's what i seem to
 
05:54:42.240 --> 05:54:45.030 align:start position:0%
confused but that's what i seem to
remember

05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:46.628 --> 05:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
if you can't answer it it might have
 
05:54:48.628 --> 05:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
been well no it wouldn't have been that
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
because i've been here since 2014 and
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
this came in in 2012 unless it was in
 
05:54:56.708 --> 05:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
the 2012-2013 session i don't recall the
 
05:54:59.510 --> 05:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
discussion of aggregation in in terms of
 
05:54:59.520 --> 05:55:00.788 align:start position:0%
discussion of aggregation in in terms of
wrecks

05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
05:55:00.798 --> 05:55:02.150 align:start position:0%
wrecks
um

05:55:02.150 --> 05:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
but but i think you had
 
05:55:06.390 --> 05:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
you had two points there that was only
 
05:55:09.270 --> 05:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead no that that that was that we
 
05:55:13.030 --> 05:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
had the two points who answered the
 
05:55:15.270 --> 05:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
first one and maybe there's somebody
 
05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
else uh from a utility who can answer my
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
question i think it okay that's a good
 
05:55:22.470 --> 05:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
point but i think it's also that it's
 
05:55:25.110 --> 05:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
not simply your utility
 
05:55:28.390 --> 05:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
that gets the wreck that's swept it's a
 
05:55:29.830 --> 05:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
pool so
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
all of them are gathered together with
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
this um
 
05:55:35.430 --> 05:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use the word fictitious
 
05:55:38.470 --> 05:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
which is not the right word uh you know
 
05:55:38.480 --> 05:55:40.708 align:start position:0%
which is not the right word uh you know
this

05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
nobody knows how much is being produced
 
05:55:45.670 --> 05:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
so you take the capacity factor times
 
05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
the actual size of the arrays and then
 
05:55:51.430 --> 05:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
some notion about how much sun there was
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and you create this number and then you
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
divide it up
 
05:55:58.628 --> 05:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
between everybody so it your your swept
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
wreck may go to
 
05:56:02.470 --> 05:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
the out of state multinational in north
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
carolina or your swept wreck may go to
 
05:56:08.548 --> 05:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
your actual local utility but you would
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
have no way of knowing and they would
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay i can provide some clarification
 
05:56:16.080 --> 05:56:18.470 align:start position:0%
okay i can provide some clarification
here

05:56:18.470 --> 05:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
a customer generator sells a wreck
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
a utility buys a wreck
 
05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
but the utility doesn't buy it directly
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
from the customer generator there's
 
05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
always a middleman
 
05:56:31.910 --> 05:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
and these middlemen
 
05:56:35.190 --> 05:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
brokers of wrecks frequently are called
 
05:56:35.200 --> 05:56:36.708 align:start position:0%
brokers of wrecks frequently are called
aggregators

05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
aggregators
 
05:56:39.590 --> 05:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
they collect together a bunch of wrecks
 
05:56:41.830 --> 05:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
and then go to you to eversource or you
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
unitil and say i've got 10 000 recs that
 
05:56:47.110 --> 05:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
i can sell you
 
05:56:49.750 --> 05:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll sell them to you for this price
 
05:56:49.760 --> 05:56:50.708 align:start position:0%
and i'll sell them to you for this price
that's

05:56:50.708 --> 05:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:56:50.718 --> 05:56:51.670 align:start position:0%
that's
what

05:56:51.670 --> 05:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:56:55.270 --> 05:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
may i clarify with the chair
 
05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:56:58.400 --> 05:56:59.350 align:start position:0%
go ahead
did

05:56:59.350 --> 05:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:56:59.940 --> 05:56:59.950 align:start position:0%
did we
 
05:56:59.950 --> 05:57:01.510 align:start position:0%
did we
[Music]

05:57:01.510 --> 05:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:57:03.590 --> 05:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i i seem to remember this did we as
 
05:57:05.510 --> 05:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
a committee authorize that
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:11.910 --> 05:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the committee
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
specifically authorizing it it is
 
05:57:16.948 --> 05:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
authorized in statute and in commission
 
05:57:16.958 --> 05:57:19.110 align:start position:0%
authorized in statute and in commission
rules

05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:57:19.120 --> 05:57:20.150 align:start position:0%
rules
it

05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:57:21.910 --> 05:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't remember when that happened
 
05:57:26.230 --> 05:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
exactly maybe when the rps was initially
 
05:57:29.910 --> 05:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
passed back in 2007 2008 that was before
 
05:57:31.510 --> 05:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
i was in the legislature you may
 
05:57:33.190 --> 05:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
remember but i don't
 
05:57:33.200 --> 05:57:34.150 align:start position:0%
remember but i don't
um

05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:36.390 --> 05:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
but that is the way it works
 
05:57:38.788 --> 05:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
if i made that's with reference to the
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
sale of rex and that's not the issue
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
here swept wrecks were never offered for
 
05:57:45.280 --> 05:57:48.708 align:start position:0%
here swept wrecks were never offered for
sale

05:57:48.708 --> 05:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:48.718 --> 05:57:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
correct

05:57:49.910 --> 05:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:57:52.628 --> 05:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee is recognized
 
05:57:54.868 --> 05:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um my question
 
05:57:56.390 --> 05:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
takes us back to the part of your
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
testimony where you mentioned
 
05:58:01.350 --> 05:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
having looked into the legal research
 
05:58:03.750 --> 05:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
over the last year making this a better
 
05:58:03.760 --> 05:58:05.350 align:start position:0%
over the last year making this a better
bill

05:58:05.350 --> 05:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:58:07.190 --> 05:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you thought that
 
05:58:10.150 --> 05:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
there could be a lawsuit against the
 
05:58:10.160 --> 05:58:11.110 align:start position:0%
there could be a lawsuit against the
state

05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
for for
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
basically undertaking a practice that
 
05:58:18.310 --> 05:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh results in property taking i guess is
 
05:58:19.750 --> 05:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to say it
 
05:58:21.990 --> 05:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case
 
05:58:22.000 --> 05:58:24.948 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case
um

05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
05:58:29.350 --> 05:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
protect against that i guess and should
 
05:58:30.708 --> 05:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
we protect against that because it
 
05:58:32.548 --> 05:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
sounds like what you're saying is we
 
05:58:34.708 --> 05:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
have a liability here
 
05:58:37.110 --> 05:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh that maybe these people have no idea
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
they could have a class action suit or
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
whatever but that we have some kind of a
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
liability that we need to
 
05:58:45.750 --> 05:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
insulate the state from does that make
 
05:58:45.760 --> 05:58:46.948 align:start position:0%
insulate the state from does that make
sense

05:58:46.948 --> 05:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:58:50.230 --> 05:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:51.910 --> 05:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer
 
05:58:53.350 --> 05:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
but i've listened to a lot of lawyers
 
05:58:54.948 --> 05:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
and i've consulted with a lot of lawyers
 
05:58:57.110 --> 05:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding
 
05:58:59.270 --> 05:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
that if the legislature were to remove
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
this provision
 
05:59:02.548 --> 05:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
there would not be
 
05:59:02.558 --> 05:59:03.350 align:start position:0%
there would not be
the

05:59:03.350 --> 05:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:59:05.590 --> 05:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
animating um
 
05:59:07.910 --> 05:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
motivation to go to a class-action
 
05:59:11.350 --> 05:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit to reclaim past damages
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
when the plaintiff's concern is
 
05:59:17.590 --> 05:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
primarily to end the practice because
 
05:59:20.390 --> 05:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
the practice itself unconstitutional
 
05:59:23.190 --> 05:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
and is an imposition which which is
 
05:59:25.830 --> 05:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
harming the members of members of the
 
05:59:25.840 --> 05:59:26.788 align:start position:0%
harming the members of members of the
state

05:59:26.788 --> 05:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:59:28.230 --> 05:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
taking their property without their
 
05:59:31.030 --> 05:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge and without compensation
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that that would be if the legislature
 
05:59:36.628 --> 05:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
were to take that action and and cease
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
and desist
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
with with its activity it it would
 
05:59:43.350 --> 05:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
render it very unlikely that that legal
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:49.590 --> 05:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
to follow up on
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee's question can you
 
05:59:53.200 --> 05:59:54.070 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee's question can you
cite

05:59:54.070 --> 05:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
cite
 
05:59:57.270 --> 05:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
the supreme court case that makes wreck
 
06:00:09.190 --> 06:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:10.708 --> 06:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
i have
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
a um
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
the supreme court case that makes it
 
06:00:16.628 --> 06:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional what makes it
 
06:00:16.638 --> 06:00:18.548 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional what makes it
unconstitutional

06:00:18.548 --> 06:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
06:00:20.948 --> 06:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
from a due process angle
 
06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
is that property is being taken by the
 
06:00:24.470 --> 06:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
state without notice and without
 
06:00:26.948 --> 06:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
compensation not for a public purpose
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
you don't need a supreme court decision
 
06:00:34.310 --> 06:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
for that that's what the constitution
 
06:00:34.320 --> 06:00:36.070 align:start position:0%
for that that's what the constitution
says

06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
says
 
06:00:39.110 --> 06:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
um there has been no legal action much
 
06:00:42.230 --> 06:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
less rising to the supreme court which
 
06:00:44.948 --> 06:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
would have them weigh in on whether in
 
06:00:47.430 --> 06:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
fact there is a due process claim
 
06:00:50.150 --> 06:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
um so there's a procedural side to the
 
06:00:52.470 --> 06:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue and there's also a
 
06:00:54.548 --> 06:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
substantive side
 
06:00:56.628 --> 06:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
06:00:59.190 --> 06:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
property is being seized
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
and the the the owner of the property
 
06:01:04.470 --> 06:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
has no recourse
 
06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up i think i said that
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
right the
 
06:01:06.958 --> 06:01:08.788 align:start position:0%
right the
constitutional

06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
06:01:10.868 --> 06:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional deprivation that your
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill specifically mentions is a presumed
 
06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
or potential
 
06:01:15.840 --> 06:01:17.708 align:start position:0%
or potential
unconstitutionally

06:01:17.708 --> 06:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional deprivation
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't been that it has not been
 
06:01:25.270 --> 06:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
submitted to a court okay great thank
 
06:01:25.280 --> 06:01:26.628 align:start position:0%
submitted to a court okay great thank
you

06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
all right further questions for
 
06:01:31.990 --> 06:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:34.708 --> 06:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none i would like to thank you
 
06:01:37.510 --> 06:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative brezny you guys
 
06:01:38.788 --> 06:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
got to raise your hands when i first
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
look at you
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for tuning in after i look
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
away he was thinking
 
06:01:42.718 --> 06:01:44.310 align:start position:0%
away he was thinking
yes

06:01:44.310 --> 06:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:01:46.948 --> 06:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
my question is does this bill only apply
 
06:01:49.750 --> 06:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
to somebody who explicitly does not want
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to
 
06:02:01.750 --> 06:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
sell their credits and enter into a
 
06:02:03.830 --> 06:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
market relationship
 
06:02:06.868 --> 06:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
would have to register them yes so that
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
they could be tracked by kneepool
 
06:02:09.360 --> 06:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
they could be tracked by kneepool
yes

06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:02:14.788 --> 06:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:18.548 --> 06:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:21.750 --> 06:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
i guess it's more if somebody
 
06:02:24.390 --> 06:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
wants to sell their credits then
 
06:02:26.708 --> 06:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
would this help them in any way to sell
 
06:02:28.390 --> 06:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
their credits
 
06:02:31.350 --> 06:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
this does not change anything whatsoever
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
about the sale of rex
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
it doesn't does not touch that issue
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
does it make it easier
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
or help
 
06:02:45.590 --> 06:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh any further representative
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:53.590 --> 06:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
 
06:02:53.600 --> 06:02:54.948 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
so

06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:02:57.510 --> 06:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to any lawsuit
 
06:02:59.910 --> 06:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
why would not the court consider
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
unregistered wrecks
 
06:03:02.080 --> 06:03:04.830 align:start position:0%
unregistered wrecks
abandoned

06:03:04.830 --> 06:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
abandoned
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
property property um
 
06:03:10.150 --> 06:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay i'll
 
06:03:12.150 --> 06:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
maybe this will answer this is a federal
 
06:03:13.590 --> 06:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
trade commission
 
06:03:13.600 --> 06:03:14.708 align:start position:0%
trade commission
provision

06:03:14.708 --> 06:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:03:17.910 --> 06:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh which to try to simplify it for for
 
06:03:20.708 --> 06:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
folks a toy manufacturer places solar
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
panels on the roof of its plant to
 
06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
generate power and advertises that its
 
06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
plant is 100 solar powered the
 
06:03:30.310 --> 06:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer however sells rex based on
 
06:03:32.470 --> 06:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
the renewable attributes of all the
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
power it generates
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
even if the manufacturer uses the
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
electricity generated by those solar
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
panels it has by selling wrecks
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
transferred the right to characterize
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
that electricity as renewable the
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
claim is therefore deceptive
 
06:03:54.868 --> 06:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
and they are subject to litigation
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
for for fraud basically
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
so i i i it's kind of a
 
06:04:03.510 --> 06:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
sideways answer to your question could
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:09.670 --> 06:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
yes so abandoned property that was your
 
06:04:11.868 --> 06:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
point why why would
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
unregistered wrecks not be considered
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
abandoned property by any court
 
06:04:20.548 --> 06:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
adjudicating this issue okay i think the
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
confusion is the term wreck which makes
 
06:04:25.110 --> 06:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
people think that there's some
 
06:04:28.390 --> 06:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
certificate thing that creates the
 
06:04:28.400 --> 06:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
certificate thing that creates the
property

06:04:29.430 --> 06:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:04:32.948 --> 06:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
no it's clear from federal state law and
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
case law that the renewable attributes
 
06:04:37.990 --> 06:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
which is what we should be talking about
 
06:04:40.150 --> 06:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
the sweeping of renewable attributes
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
which are represented in rex
 
06:04:45.430 --> 06:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
so the renewable attributes are created
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
the moment you create the energy they
 
06:04:51.190 --> 06:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
are as it were bundled with the electron
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
if you try to separate them
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
you get a wreck that then represents
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
that renewable attribute and your
 
06:05:01.030 --> 06:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
self-generated electricity that goes out
 
06:05:03.590 --> 06:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
is now null it's not abandoned it's not
 
06:05:05.830 --> 06:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
lost but it's characterized as null
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
electricity you can't call it renewable
 
06:05:10.868 --> 06:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
the renewable attribute of the energy
 
06:05:12.788 --> 06:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
has been transferred
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
to the new owner who is either the
 
06:05:17.350 --> 06:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
purchaser of a wreck
 
06:05:18.470 --> 06:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
or the
 
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
do you need a follow-up
 
06:05:30.470 --> 06:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
no no follow-up no okay
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsuch
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
06:05:34.320 --> 06:05:35.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

06:05:35.910 --> 06:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:05:35.920 --> 06:05:36.868 align:start position:0%
representative
uh

06:05:36.868 --> 06:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
just to kind of clarify it seems to me
 
06:05:40.868 --> 06:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
the question that was just asked about
 
06:05:42.868 --> 06:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
abandoned property is a good one
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
but if i have a home
 
06:05:48.470 --> 06:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
and it's registered in my town
 
06:05:48.480 --> 06:05:49.830 align:start position:0%
and it's registered in my town
and

06:05:49.830 --> 06:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm doing everything to maintain by law
 
06:05:55.510 --> 06:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody tries to do something
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
with it they would have to notify me
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
about it before anything can happen
 
06:05:59.680 --> 06:06:00.708 align:start position:0%
about it before anything can happen
so

06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:00.718 --> 06:06:01.590 align:start position:0%
so
uh

06:06:01.590 --> 06:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:03.430 --> 06:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you have something that you own and
 
06:06:05.830 --> 06:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
then your poc knows that you own this
 
06:06:05.840 --> 06:06:07.030 align:start position:0%
then your poc knows that you own this
solar

06:06:07.030 --> 06:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
solar
 
06:06:07.040 --> 06:06:08.548 align:start position:0%
solar
array

06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
array
 
06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
and somebody wants to do something with
 
06:06:10.558 --> 06:06:11.510 align:start position:0%
and somebody wants to do something with
it

06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah if you're not around you don't
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
react to any kind of notification or
 
06:06:18.070 --> 06:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
information i guess people could say you
 
06:06:20.070 --> 06:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
abandoned it but in this case people
 
06:06:21.990 --> 06:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
aren't abandoning it that's still theirs
 
06:06:23.910 --> 06:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
they just don't know any someone's doing
 
06:06:26.070 --> 06:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
something with their property
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
i mean there is no notification there
 
06:06:31.670 --> 06:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
there is no notice
 
06:06:34.150 --> 06:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the property has been transferred
 
06:06:36.628 --> 06:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been abandoned it was it was
 
06:06:40.070 --> 06:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
originally owned by the generator
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
and then if it is conveyed to someone
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
else either by sale or sweeping
 
06:06:48.230 --> 06:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's now owned by the other guy
 
06:06:52.788 --> 06:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:54.868 --> 06:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative white is
 
06:06:56.548 --> 06:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
06:06:58.470 --> 06:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
is it safe to say that this that these
 
06:07:00.070 --> 06:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
are essentially
 
06:07:02.310 --> 06:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
intellectual property and not tangible
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
physical property that is the uh i
 
06:07:05.840 --> 06:07:06.788 align:start position:0%
physical property that is the uh i
yes

06:07:06.788 --> 06:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:07:07.830 --> 06:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's an appropriate
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
characteristic that's where a lot of
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
people get infused it is and and and
 
06:07:13.830 --> 06:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
intangible property is a more difficult
 
06:07:15.750 --> 06:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
concept yeah just want to clarify that
 
06:07:17.590 --> 06:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:07:19.590 --> 06:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
06:07:20.628 --> 06:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
a question
 
06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair and this strictly
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
just for clarification in my own mind
 
06:07:26.470 --> 06:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
please um
 
06:07:26.480 --> 06:07:27.910 align:start position:0%
please um
so

06:07:27.910 --> 06:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:30.150 --> 06:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
are you implied and intellectual
 
06:07:32.548 --> 06:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
property was a good one to come up
 
06:07:32.558 --> 06:07:33.910 align:start position:0%
property was a good one to come up
but

06:07:33.910 --> 06:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
i seem to hear the fact that this all
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
pertains to what people
 
06:07:41.830 --> 06:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
know they have and are
 
06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
using it but someone might be taking it
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
away from them so my question is
 
06:07:49.110 --> 06:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
is this the case where people are
 
06:07:49.120 --> 06:07:50.310 align:start position:0%
is this the case where people are
generating

06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
generating
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
more power than they're using and they
 
06:07:53.670 --> 06:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
they would have rex if they were
 
06:07:55.510 --> 06:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
registered but they're not but they have
 
06:07:57.350 --> 06:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
this excess power that they don't even
 
06:07:58.708 --> 06:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
know they have
 
06:08:01.110 --> 06:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
and they're not doing anything with it
 
06:08:01.120 --> 06:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
and they're not doing anything with it
so

06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:08:03.750 --> 06:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
is it in fact
 
06:08:07.110 --> 06:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh taking of of intellectual property so
 
06:08:08.868 --> 06:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
to speak that they don't know they have
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i if i'm asking the
 
06:08:13.510 --> 06:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
right question but if you don't know you
 
06:08:15.510 --> 06:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
ha you own something
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
and you're not planning to do anything
 
06:08:19.750 --> 06:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
with something you don't know your own
 
06:08:23.430 --> 06:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
how how is that taking away from you and
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
if if that makes any sense i'm just
 
06:08:27.430 --> 06:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense for for
 
06:08:29.110 --> 06:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
people that don't have their power
 
06:08:30.948 --> 06:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
directs registered
 
06:08:33.030 --> 06:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
what are they losing and would they have
 
06:08:34.310 --> 06:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
done something with them even though
 
06:08:36.548 --> 06:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
they don't know they have it
 
06:08:38.310 --> 06:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
you're getting to the very nub of the
 
06:08:39.910 --> 06:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
issue and i thank you for the question
 
06:08:42.070 --> 06:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's useful clarification
 
06:08:42.080 --> 06:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
it's useful clarification
consumers

06:08:43.990 --> 06:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
06:08:44.000 --> 06:08:45.270 align:start position:0%
consumers
have

06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
two uses for their property
 
06:08:50.548 --> 06:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
in this particular arena
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
the one is that i can claim i'm doing my
 
06:08:56.310 --> 06:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
best here to reduce my carbon footprint
 
06:08:59.350 --> 06:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
i have invested in a solar array and i
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
am using that energy and i am putting it
 
06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
out onto the grid for the benefit of
 
06:09:03.600 --> 06:09:05.350 align:start position:0%
out onto the grid for the benefit of
others

06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
others
 
06:09:07.990 --> 06:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's my primary use that's my primary
 
06:09:10.628 --> 06:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
motivation in getting that array
 
06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
my secondary use is i want to make sure
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
that we have fuel diversity in new
 
06:09:16.948 --> 06:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire i want to make sure that
 
06:09:19.270 --> 06:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's more renewable energy beyond
 
06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
legally mandated minimums so i'm going
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
to do this i'm going to buy this array
 
06:09:25.990 --> 06:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to produce this energy to make
 
06:09:28.230 --> 06:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
sure there is more renewable energy
 
06:09:28.240 --> 06:09:29.350 align:start position:0%
sure there is more renewable energy
available

06:09:29.350 --> 06:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:09:29.360 --> 06:09:30.070 align:start position:0%
available
okay

06:09:30.070 --> 06:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
rex sweeping denies you both of those
 
06:09:36.548 --> 06:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
first of all you cannot say you produce
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
and consume renewable energy because the
 
06:09:41.990 --> 06:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes have been taken
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
away by state action and they have been
 
06:09:47.910 --> 06:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
granted to corporations for their own
 
06:09:47.920 --> 06:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
granted to corporations for their own
use

06:09:49.190 --> 06:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:09:51.270 --> 06:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
in the second case
 
06:09:53.350 --> 06:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
which was creating more renewable energy
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
than the legally mandated minimum
 
06:09:56.958 --> 06:09:58.948 align:start position:0%
than the legally mandated minimum
by

06:09:58.948 --> 06:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
by creating the array by using the
 
06:10:03.350 --> 06:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
energy from the array i have diminished
 
06:10:05.590 --> 06:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
the total amount of electricity that's
 
06:10:05.600 --> 06:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
the total amount of electricity that's
available

06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:10:09.990 --> 06:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the rps requirement so i've i've
 
06:10:12.708 --> 06:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
reduced the corporation's
 
06:10:15.510 --> 06:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
need to buy wrecks because i've reduced
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
the pool of electricity
 
06:10:20.470 --> 06:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
and then you let them take
 
06:10:21.590 --> 06:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
the wreck
 
06:10:22.948 --> 06:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
and apply it
 
06:10:24.548 --> 06:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
so there's it's not like a double
 
06:10:26.628 --> 06:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
dipping but it's a double whammy
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
you you let them apply it to their
 
06:10:31.510 --> 06:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
compliance so you further reduce the
 
06:10:33.750 --> 06:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
legally required amount of renewable
 
06:10:35.110 --> 06:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
energy that will be produced in new
 
06:10:35.120 --> 06:10:36.628 align:start position:0%
energy that will be produced in new
hampshire

06:10:36.628 --> 06:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
in fact if you if you run the numbers
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
and i had to do this many times because
 
06:10:42.548 --> 06:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
it didn't make sense to me until i saw
 
06:10:45.190 --> 06:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
it with the mathematical formula
 
06:10:47.750 --> 06:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
you would have been better off not to
 
06:10:49.830 --> 06:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
have invested in renewable energy there
 
06:10:51.750 --> 06:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
would have been more renewable energy in
 
06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
if you had not created and generated
 
06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
that array
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
because of what you've done to the rps
 
06:11:01.670 --> 06:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
compliance mechanism
 
06:11:01.680 --> 06:11:02.948 align:start position:0%
compliance mechanism
less

06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
less
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
is generated
 
06:11:05.600 --> 06:11:06.628 align:start position:0%
is generated
follow-up

06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for the
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up so on point number one
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
am i correct that you're saying that uh
 
06:11:17.990 --> 06:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
you you would be taking away the right
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
for someone to claim that they are
 
06:11:22.310 --> 06:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
generating renewable energy
 
06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
that is a property right yes right and
 
06:11:27.990 --> 06:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
but point number two escapes me
 
06:11:29.590 --> 06:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh in that
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
if they're not doing anything with the
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
excess power that they're generating
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
even if they even knew they had it
 
06:11:40.390 --> 06:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:43.590 --> 06:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
losing that into the grid because they
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't even know they have it and if
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
they're not using it how how are we
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
losing it
 
06:11:49.910 --> 06:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're confusing the physical electron
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
which could be
 
06:11:53.350 --> 06:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
lost into the grid with the property
 
06:11:55.510 --> 06:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
right which is completely separated from
 
06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
the physical electron you know when you
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
create it they're bundled together the
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute and the electricity
 
06:12:06.470 --> 06:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
but as soon as there is a
 
06:12:11.030 --> 06:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
taking of it by sweeping or a sale of it
 
06:12:13.830 --> 06:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
you have split those two apart
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
and now the ability to say i use you can
 
06:12:19.350 --> 06:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
have a coal-fired power plant produce
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
all of your energy for your factory but
 
06:12:24.708 --> 06:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
if you buy rex you can say a hundred
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
percent green a hundred percent
 
06:12:29.430 --> 06:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy was used to produce
 
06:12:31.030 --> 06:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
this product
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
because the renewable attributes were
 
06:12:35.670 --> 06:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
conveyed by the transfer the property
 
06:12:37.750 --> 06:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
right to claim
 
06:12:37.760 --> 06:12:39.670 align:start position:0%
right to claim
renewable

06:12:39.670 --> 06:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
goes with the
 
06:12:42.470 --> 06:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
with us with the wreck whether it's
 
06:12:44.948 --> 06:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
swept or sold
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative cretian is recognized
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thanks for taking my
 
06:12:53.110 --> 06:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
question so my understanding is it's
 
06:12:55.750 --> 06:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
also taking away the person's ability to
 
06:12:58.310 --> 06:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
sell their wreck if they wanted to
 
06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
once it gets swept
 
06:13:03.590 --> 06:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
they not only cannot say i've produced
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy but if if i wanted to
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
sell those wrecks to an aggregator i
 
06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to now it's a very
 
06:13:12.470 --> 06:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
interesting question and i think you
 
06:13:13.990 --> 06:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
might want to go to the sustainable
 
06:13:15.670 --> 06:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
energy division which used to be at the
 
06:13:19.590 --> 06:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
puc and is now over at doe and ask them
 
06:13:19.600 --> 06:13:20.548 align:start position:0%
puc and is now over at doe and ask them
has

06:13:20.548 --> 06:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:13:23.190 --> 06:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
have i had my wreck swept it
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
am i entitled to register my production
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
and claim
 
06:13:30.548 --> 06:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
my wrecks or has that already been taken
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
away from me and i have to wait until
 
06:13:36.070 --> 06:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
next year or whatever the period is in
 
06:13:38.070 --> 06:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
order to say hey
 
06:13:39.430 --> 06:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to register it i'm going to
 
06:13:41.510 --> 06:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
retain it nobody's taking my property
 
06:13:42.948 --> 06:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
away from me without my knowledge and
 
06:13:42.958 --> 06:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
away from me without my knowledge and
consent

06:13:43.990 --> 06:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
consent
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
much less compensation which is also
 
06:13:49.270 --> 06:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
required by state takings
 
06:13:54.548 --> 06:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.868 --> 06:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett is recognized
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:13:58.160 --> 06:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

06:13:59.030 --> 06:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:14:01.350 --> 06:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want to attribute motive to any
 
06:14:03.190 --> 06:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
person who's got
 
06:14:08.470 --> 06:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
a a wreckable system uh but but some may
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
not care
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's too small they don't want a hassle
 
06:14:14.548 --> 06:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
of paperwork how is that a taking then
 
06:14:16.708 --> 06:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
if they're just not bothering and if if
 
06:14:18.230 --> 06:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
if you've changed the law the way you
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
want doesn't that force
 
06:14:20.638 --> 06:14:22.070 align:start position:0%
want doesn't that force
uh

06:14:22.070 --> 06:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:23.830 --> 06:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
essentially credit for something they
 
06:14:25.190 --> 06:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
didn't want to follow through with it a
 
06:14:26.548 --> 06:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
lot of other people are following
 
06:14:26.558 --> 06:14:28.070 align:start position:0%
lot of other people are following
through

06:14:28.070 --> 06:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:14:30.548 --> 06:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
i i i don't
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
want to be fanciful but if i lived in
 
06:14:35.990 --> 06:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
colorado and i owned 150 acres of uh
 
06:14:38.548 --> 06:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
prairie land and i never saw it and
 
06:14:41.670 --> 06:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else grazed their animals on it
 
06:14:43.110 --> 06:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
am i harmed
 
06:14:45.110 --> 06:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
by somebody else taking my property and
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:52.470 --> 06:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
you can answer the question
 
06:14:53.750 --> 06:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm harmed
 
06:14:55.590 --> 06:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's my property and somebody else is
 
06:14:57.590 --> 06:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
taking it and using it and they're you
 
06:14:59.590 --> 06:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
know creating erosion and they're doing
 
06:15:01.830 --> 06:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
other things that you know maybe the
 
06:15:03.510 --> 06:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
purpose that i bought the land for was
 
06:15:05.830 --> 06:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that prairie dogs could
 
06:15:05.840 --> 06:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
to make sure that prairie dogs could
flourish

06:15:07.910 --> 06:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
flourish
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay we have two people uh two
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
additional people signed up to testify
 
06:15:12.948 --> 06:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
06:15:15.750 --> 06:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
and as a result i'd like to move on if
 
06:15:17.190 --> 06:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's okay with the other members of
 
06:15:19.590 --> 06:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:15:21.270 --> 06:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
so representative oxendine we really
 
06:15:23.030 --> 06:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming in and testifying
 
06:15:24.868 --> 06:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
on this bill today and
 
06:15:27.110 --> 06:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
please have a safe trip home
 
06:15:27.120 --> 06:15:29.190 align:start position:0%
please have a safe trip home
and

06:15:29.190 --> 06:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
we will now call on griffin roberge from
 
06:15:34.470 --> 06:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to testify on
 
06:15:39.830 --> 06:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:41.350 --> 06:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
i should have turned it off before i did
 
06:15:43.430 --> 06:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah that would have worked
 
06:15:45.430 --> 06:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me i have a question for the
 
06:15:45.440 --> 06:15:46.628 align:start position:0%
excuse me i have a question for the

06:15:46.638 --> 06:15:49.430 align:start position:0%
chair
yes

06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit a piece of me that's
 
06:15:53.270 --> 06:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
feeling uncomfortable
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
if we've been told that we're going to
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
possibly have litigation
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
and these tapes of this meeting can be
 
06:16:04.070 --> 06:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
discussing this at all
 
06:16:07.510 --> 06:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
i i
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know but i feel uncomfortable
 
06:16:10.548 --> 06:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:16:12.390 --> 06:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
well we're not discussing it we're
 
06:16:14.788 --> 06:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
asking questions and getting answers and
 
06:16:17.670 --> 06:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's the legitimate purpose okay of
 
06:16:19.430 --> 06:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
our committee right
 
06:16:20.868 --> 06:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
well i
 
06:16:22.868 --> 06:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
but i have never come into a committee
 
06:16:25.510 --> 06:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
meeting in 25 years where somebody has
 
06:16:25.520 --> 06:16:26.390 align:start position:0%
meeting in 25 years where somebody has
said

06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:16:28.390 --> 06:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
if you don't do this this is probably
 
06:16:30.390 --> 06:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
going to go to court knowing that these
 
06:16:30.400 --> 06:16:31.270 align:start position:0%
going to go to court knowing that these
tapes

06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
tapes
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
and anything that's said in here
 
06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
can be used and we can be witnesses so i
 
06:16:38.150 --> 06:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know if there's a
 
06:16:41.030 --> 06:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
clarification on that thank you
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
yes you're welcome
 
06:16:42.638 --> 06:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
yes you're welcome
uh

06:16:43.670 --> 06:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:16:45.670 --> 06:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
i have heard of that kind of thing
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
happening in committee meetings on
 
06:16:49.110 --> 06:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
numerous occasions so
 
06:16:50.548 --> 06:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a first for this committee
 
06:16:53.830 --> 06:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not a first for committees so
 
06:16:57.350 --> 06:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
mr robarge you're uh on for uh your
 
06:16:59.350 --> 06:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill thank you thank
 
06:17:00.868 --> 06:17:00.878 align:start position:0%

griffin roberts from the new hampshire
 
06:17:05.910 --> 06:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
department of energy here to
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
provide testimony in house bill 1645.
 
06:17:11.190 --> 06:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral but however i
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
understand that there has been an
 
06:17:14.548 --> 06:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
amendment introduced by representative
 
06:17:14.558 --> 06:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
amendment introduced by representative
oxenham

06:17:15.830 --> 06:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
oxenham
 
06:17:17.590 --> 06:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
i don't feel comfortable commenting on
 
06:17:17.600 --> 06:17:18.548 align:start position:0%
i don't feel comfortable commenting on
it

06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
until i
 
06:17:22.150 --> 06:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
am able to look at it more thoroughly on
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
short glance it looks like it repeals
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
the uh class one and class two uh wreck
 
06:17:30.150 --> 06:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
sweeping credit
 
06:17:30.160 --> 06:17:31.190 align:start position:0%
sweeping credit
um

06:17:31.190 --> 06:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:33.910 --> 06:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's currently in statute
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
initially i had intended to come here
 
06:17:38.230 --> 06:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
today to testify on the substance of the
 
06:17:39.910 --> 06:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced
 
06:17:41.590 --> 06:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:17:44.868 --> 06:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
was unsure as to how it would
 
06:17:47.670 --> 06:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
comply with what's on page three lines
 
06:17:50.310 --> 06:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
one to seven it does in terms of this
 
06:17:52.230 --> 06:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
notice that would be sent to customer
 
06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
generators it would require the
 
06:17:55.430 --> 06:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy to fulfill that
 
06:17:58.390 --> 06:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
obligation i just wanted to note that
 
06:17:59.670 --> 06:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:18:00.948 --> 06:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know isn't in the business of
 
06:18:03.430 --> 06:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
conducting mass mailings to
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
customer generators or anything like
 
06:18:06.868 --> 06:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
that and the language does allow the
 
06:18:08.230 --> 06:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
department to
 
06:18:09.430 --> 06:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
shift that responsibility to
 
06:18:12.230 --> 06:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
distribution companies and
 
06:18:14.548 --> 06:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
installers of renewable energy systems
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for net metering
 
06:18:18.788 --> 06:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
given that that's a likelihood that
 
06:18:20.070 --> 06:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
would take place if this bill were to
 
06:18:21.910 --> 06:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
pass as introduced
 
06:18:25.030 --> 06:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:27.670 --> 06:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
cause some rate impacts at least for
 
06:18:29.510 --> 06:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
the utilities and recovering the cost
 
06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
for that mailing
 
06:18:33.510 --> 06:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
additionally in the notice as well
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
the department had concerned with what
 
06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
was said on page two line 18 to 28 where
 
06:18:41.830 --> 06:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:43.590 --> 06:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory action from the federal trade
 
06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
commission there isn't any specificity
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
there in statute citing the
 
06:18:47.600 --> 06:18:48.548 align:start position:0%
there in statute citing the
federal

06:18:48.548 --> 06:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
federal
 
06:18:51.750 --> 06:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
rule or ftc rule that
 
06:18:55.910 --> 06:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:58.788 --> 06:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
for this regulatory action um certainly
 
06:19:00.468 --> 06:19:00.478 align:start position:0%
we'll try to answer any questions that
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
people might have regarding the
 
06:19:02.798 --> 06:19:03.590 align:start position:0%
people might have regarding the
uh

06:19:03.590 --> 06:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:19:06.788 --> 06:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
rps and the credit mechanism as i think
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
the committee has discussed that bill
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
that credit was amended last year with
 
06:19:12.868 --> 06:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
representative harrington's house bill
 
06:19:12.878 --> 06:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
representative harrington's house bill
309

06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
309
 
06:19:16.230 --> 06:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
reduced the capacity factor for that
 
06:19:17.990 --> 06:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
credit from 20 percent to one that's
 
06:19:20.310 --> 06:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
tied to iso new england it's around a
 
06:19:20.320 --> 06:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
tied to iso new england it's around a
more

06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:27.990 --> 06:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
it is in statute currently and
 
06:19:30.310 --> 06:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
everything like that is being used um i
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
can cite what the credit has been in
 
06:19:34.468 --> 06:19:34.478 align:start position:0%
past compliance years but i couldn't
 
06:19:35.750 --> 06:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
cite that for
 
06:19:37.510 --> 06:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
anything recent just because that
 
06:19:39.590 --> 06:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
information isn't readily available
 
06:19:41.110 --> 06:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll only answer any questions that
 
06:19:42.788 --> 06:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
the committee might have
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
but i realized that there was also some
 
06:19:46.548 --> 06:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
06:19:49.750 --> 06:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
legal concerns i'm not a lawyer and i'm
 
06:19:52.150 --> 06:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
not going to try to answer any questions
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
on that so
 
06:19:55.670 --> 06:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask but you know i don't
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
think i can answer anything like that
 
06:19:56.878 --> 06:19:58.468 align:start position:0%
think i can answer anything like that
definitively

06:19:58.468 --> 06:19:58.478 align:start position:0%
definitively
 
06:20:00.468 --> 06:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony
 
06:20:08.310 --> 06:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:09.910 --> 06:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
all right miss uh representative
 
06:20:09.920 --> 06:20:12.868 align:start position:0%
all right miss uh representative
pimentel

06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh mr
 
06:20:15.760 --> 06:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh mr
roberts

06:20:17.030 --> 06:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
roberts
 
06:20:17.040 --> 06:20:18.390 align:start position:0%
roberts
so

06:20:18.390 --> 06:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
basically all of your comments were on a
 
06:20:23.270 --> 06:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill that wasn't introduced and my
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
question is
 
06:20:27.990 --> 06:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh the bill that was introduced simply
 
06:20:30.548 --> 06:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
eliminates wreck sweeping could you
 
06:20:32.230 --> 06:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
comment on how
 
06:20:34.868 --> 06:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
that will affect anything yes so so the
 
06:20:37.030 --> 06:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
amendment would repeal the credit you
 
06:20:38.788 --> 06:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
know i can i can really only reference
 
06:20:40.788 --> 06:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
to what was done what was mentioned in
 
06:20:42.788 --> 06:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
the past um
 
06:20:46.150 --> 06:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of context the puc
 
06:20:47.750 --> 06:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
when the puc managed the renewable
 
06:20:49.830 --> 06:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
06:20:51.830 --> 06:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
regularly conducted reviews every so
 
06:20:54.150 --> 06:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
often on the on the art on the renewable
 
06:20:55.990 --> 06:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard offer it was a
 
06:20:58.708 --> 06:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
stakeholder driven process with a lot of
 
06:21:01.350 --> 06:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
collaboration and
 
06:21:03.110 --> 06:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
made recommendations to the legislature
 
06:21:04.788 --> 06:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
as to what should change
 
06:21:06.628 --> 06:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion in the last
 
06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
review in 2018
 
06:21:10.868 --> 06:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
on the class two net metering credit and
 
06:21:13.110 --> 06:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
i can certainly provide that review with
 
06:21:16.230 --> 06:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee but in short
 
06:21:17.350 --> 06:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
amongst the stakeholders who were
 
06:21:19.190 --> 06:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
involved quote there was no consensus
 
06:21:20.548 --> 06:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
amongst the stakeholders on the
 
06:21:22.548 --> 06:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
necessity of the net metering credit for
 
06:21:23.910 --> 06:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
class two
 
06:21:26.310 --> 06:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
some stakeholders argued in favor of
 
06:21:28.070 --> 06:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
retaining the credit because it reduces
 
06:21:29.590 --> 06:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of compliance for
 
06:21:32.070 --> 06:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
electric providers thereby reducing the
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
impact of rps compliance costs on
 
06:21:33.840 --> 06:21:34.948 align:start position:0%
impact of rps compliance costs on
ratepayers

06:21:34.948 --> 06:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
others thought the credit should be
 
06:21:38.070 --> 06:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated to increase the market for
 
06:21:41.830 --> 06:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
class two wrecks or reducedness of all
 
06:21:44.468 --> 06:21:44.478 align:start position:0%
eligible solar pv sites in new hampshire
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
including those that are not rec
 
06:21:45.920 --> 06:21:47.030 align:start position:0%
including those that are not rec
certified

06:21:47.030 --> 06:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
certified
 
06:21:47.040 --> 06:21:48.468 align:start position:0%
certified
additionally

06:21:48.468 --> 06:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
06:21:50.548 --> 06:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
because pv facilities for which the
 
06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
credit is being claimed likely received
 
06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
support from the renewable energy fund
 
06:21:57.670 --> 06:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'll put attack on this for now the
 
06:22:00.150 --> 06:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is funded through
 
06:22:01.590 --> 06:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments under
 
06:22:03.030 --> 06:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard to
 
06:22:03.040 --> 06:22:03.990 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard to
provide

06:22:03.990 --> 06:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
provide
 
06:22:06.390 --> 06:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
rebates to residents commercial
 
06:22:10.708 --> 06:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
industrial customers to develop
 
06:22:12.628 --> 06:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
projects that might produce wrecks to
 
06:22:14.548 --> 06:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
help you know provide more wrecks to the
 
06:22:14.558 --> 06:22:16.548 align:start position:0%
help you know provide more wrecks to the
market

06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
market
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
further because pv facilities for which
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
the credit is being claimed likely
 
06:22:19.200 --> 06:22:20.070 align:start position:0%
the credit is being claimed likely
received

06:22:20.070 --> 06:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
received
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
support from the renewable energy fund
 
06:22:23.910 --> 06:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
the energy generated from non-rec
 
06:22:25.990 --> 06:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
certified net metered solar electric
 
06:22:27.990 --> 06:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
facilities should contribute to the
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
state's renewable energy policy goal of
 
06:22:32.390 --> 06:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
20 of uh renewed state's renewable
 
06:22:34.310 --> 06:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
energy goal so i'm sorry representative
 
06:22:36.390 --> 06:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
06:22:38.548 --> 06:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
under the renewable portfolio standard
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
there are some entity or residents
 
06:22:42.948 --> 06:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
businesses that received rebates to
 
06:22:45.990 --> 06:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
create pv facilities and that was funded
 
06:22:48.468 --> 06:22:48.478 align:start position:0%
through alternative compliance payments
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
the credit mechanism is a way to capture
 
06:22:52.390 --> 06:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
those people who might not be rec
 
06:22:54.390 --> 06:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
certified but did receive a renew a
 
06:22:56.468 --> 06:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
rebate from the renewable energy fund
 
06:22:59.430 --> 06:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
without that credit based on the review
 
06:23:01.510 --> 06:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's isn't a real way to capture
 
06:23:03.190 --> 06:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
those folks to help contribute to the
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
rps goals
 
06:23:06.868 --> 06:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
hope that answers the question a little
 
06:23:09.910 --> 06:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
bit mr chair a question for the chair
 
06:23:11.990 --> 06:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
just for clarification i i believe i
 
06:23:16.070 --> 06:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
heard the representative's question
 
06:23:18.788 --> 06:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
refer to the the amendment as being
 
06:23:20.788 --> 06:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
introduced into the committee in fact it
 
06:23:22.468 --> 06:23:22.478 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
06:23:24.788 --> 06:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced is what's been
 
06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
introduced to the committee and the
 
06:23:29.030 --> 06:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh can be spoken
 
06:23:31.830 --> 06:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
to from from the originator uh but for
 
06:23:33.590 --> 06:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
the record it was has not been
 
06:23:35.670 --> 06:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
introduced in into the committee
 
06:23:35.680 --> 06:23:36.548 align:start position:0%
introduced in into the committee
yet

06:23:36.548 --> 06:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:23:38.708 --> 06:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
technically you are correct yes
 
06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay apologies for that um
 
06:23:44.708 --> 06:23:44.718 align:start position:0%

06:23:56.868 --> 06:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
puc decision or what was that you just
 
06:24:00.310 --> 06:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry this is the 2018 rps
 
06:24:00.320 --> 06:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry this is the 2018 rps
review

06:24:01.430 --> 06:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:24:03.190 --> 06:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and again i can certainly share that
 
06:24:05.110 --> 06:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
with members of the committee if people
 
06:24:07.190 --> 06:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
want to go looking for it for themselves
 
06:24:10.390 --> 06:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
it specifically starts on page 27
 
06:24:14.948 --> 06:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:17.270 --> 06:24:17.280 align:start position:0%

06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:29.670 --> 06:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
donna gamache who wants to testify on
 
06:24:38.150 --> 06:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:39.830 --> 06:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you donna gamache with eversource
 
06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
again this afternoon i appreciate your
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
indulging me i didn't intend to testify
 
06:24:45.910 --> 06:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and i put the pink card
 
06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
in before griffin had a chance to finish
 
06:24:49.110 --> 06:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
and i think he really spoke to
 
06:24:51.270 --> 06:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
everything that i wanted to say
 
06:24:54.310 --> 06:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
but in a nutshell i'm waiting for
 
06:24:56.868 --> 06:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
information back from our team
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
to show what does that look like when we
 
06:25:01.190 --> 06:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a term of use whether you
 
06:25:03.190 --> 06:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
call it sweeping or aggregating we call
 
06:25:07.350 --> 06:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
it aggregating all of that power that um
 
06:25:09.030 --> 06:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
wrecks are not being created by the
 
06:25:10.868 --> 06:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
powers because it's too small
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so a decision had been made by you
 
06:25:17.110 --> 06:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature that it since customers
 
06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
are required to pay
 
06:25:21.990 --> 06:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
um for the utilities to purchase the
 
06:25:24.150 --> 06:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
wrecks to comply with the rps payment
 
06:25:26.788 --> 06:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
that there in fact is renewable energy
 
06:25:28.868 --> 06:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
being created that
 
06:25:31.190 --> 06:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
they contributed to a fund to help
 
06:25:33.990 --> 06:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
provide a grant to install those that it
 
06:25:35.750 --> 06:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be applied against the requirement
 
06:25:37.750 --> 06:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
from the utilities i know that the
 
06:25:39.510 --> 06:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor did say
 
06:25:39.520 --> 06:25:40.390 align:start position:0%
sponsor did say
that

06:25:40.390 --> 06:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:25:40.400 --> 06:25:41.670 align:start position:0%
that
utilities

06:25:41.670 --> 06:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
06:25:43.830 --> 06:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know put that savings back to
 
06:25:45.510 --> 06:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
customers we do not keep it but i wanted
 
06:25:47.510 --> 06:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you understood that we
 
06:25:50.548 --> 06:25:50.558 align:start position:0%
do not keep that um and oh i might have
 
06:25:52.468 --> 06:25:52.478 align:start position:0%
it here now let me just see
 
06:25:52.478 --> 06:25:53.190 align:start position:0%
it here now let me just see
so

06:25:53.190 --> 06:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:53.200 --> 06:25:54.468 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:25:54.468 --> 06:25:54.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:56.468 --> 06:25:56.478 align:start position:0%
last year it i was waiting for this to
 
06:25:58.070 --> 06:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
come back is again i wasn't expecting to
 
06:25:58.080 --> 06:25:59.270 align:start position:0%
come back is again i wasn't expecting to
testify

06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:26:01.830 --> 06:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
last year for our customers the savings
 
06:26:03.190 --> 06:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
was a million
 
06:26:05.590 --> 06:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
on their compliance for the rps
 
06:26:07.670 --> 06:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
statewide it was roughly two and a half
 
06:26:07.680 --> 06:26:08.628 align:start position:0%
statewide it was roughly two and a half
million

06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:26:11.350 --> 06:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
so if you as a legislature determined
 
06:26:13.990 --> 06:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
that you want to do it differently we do
 
06:26:14.000 --> 06:26:14.788 align:start position:0%
that you want to do it differently we do
not

06:26:14.788 --> 06:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:26:16.390 --> 06:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
we do not take a position on that that
 
06:26:18.788 --> 06:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
is clearly in within your um rights to
 
06:26:21.270 --> 06:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
do so i just wanted to clarify but i
 
06:26:24.070 --> 06:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
think griffin did a good job that um we
 
06:26:25.830 --> 06:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
why you why you made the decision to do
 
06:26:27.590 --> 06:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
it in the first place that we don't keep
 
06:26:29.510 --> 06:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
the dollars the dollars go back um to
 
06:26:31.190 --> 06:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
our customers and with that i'm done
 
06:26:32.468 --> 06:26:32.478 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
06:26:34.478 --> 06:26:35.430 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
question

06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:26:37.750 --> 06:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
to simplify what you just said if we
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
eliminate if we pass this bill it raises
 
06:26:42.230 --> 06:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
customer rates by one million in your
 
06:26:43.270 --> 06:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
case and two and a half million
 
06:26:43.280 --> 06:26:45.030 align:start position:0%
case and two and a half million
statewide

06:26:45.030 --> 06:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
06:26:45.040 --> 06:26:46.230 align:start position:0%
statewide
um

06:26:46.230 --> 06:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:46.240 --> 06:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
um
that's

06:26:47.750 --> 06:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct but it is in your um
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
purview i i would just say that i what i
 
06:26:53.990 --> 06:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
heard the speaker say that excuse me the
 
06:26:56.548 --> 06:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
sponsors say was that there's like a
 
06:26:58.708 --> 06:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
social benefits to holding on to those
 
06:27:01.110 --> 06:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
wrecks and not so that that utilities
 
06:27:02.788 --> 06:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
continue to have to go out and purchase
 
06:27:04.628 --> 06:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
more wrecks for that same amount of
 
06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
power that it's in the it's in the best
 
06:27:07.990 --> 06:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
interest of the public i leave that to
 
06:27:09.990 --> 06:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
you to decide
 
06:27:11.510 --> 06:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:27:15.670 --> 06:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsich is recognized
 
06:27:17.750 --> 06:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
06:27:19.830 --> 06:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
miss kimash
 
06:27:22.548 --> 06:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
i understand that one person's savings
 
06:27:24.868 --> 06:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
is another person's expense
 
06:27:26.628 --> 06:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
so if we're now
 
06:27:26.638 --> 06:27:27.830 align:start position:0%
so if we're now
taking

06:27:27.830 --> 06:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
taking
 
06:27:29.750 --> 06:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
this attribution
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
from some
 
06:27:33.350 --> 06:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
of our residents
 
06:27:36.390 --> 06:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
are we not using that to subsidize the
 
06:27:39.430 --> 06:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
power from the utilities for other
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
residents but nonetheless we are taking
 
06:27:43.510 --> 06:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
it for someone
 
06:27:45.030 --> 06:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
without their permission without
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
compensation and yes of course it's
 
06:27:50.310 --> 06:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
gonna have a beneficial impact on those
 
06:27:52.390 --> 06:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're not taking them from
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
but the point of the sponsor i think was
 
06:27:57.030 --> 06:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be doing this without
 
06:28:00.390 --> 06:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
permission or or uh i mean so
 
06:28:02.468 --> 06:28:02.478 align:start position:0%
don't you agree that when you're saying
 
06:28:04.948 --> 06:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
okay this would cause an increase in the
 
06:28:06.390 --> 06:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
06:28:09.910 --> 06:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of power to ratepayers
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's certainly true but we're doing it
 
06:28:14.230 --> 06:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
at the cost of taking that attribution
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:20.788 --> 06:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
i i think the best way to answer that is
 
06:28:22.310 --> 06:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
that that's a determination that you
 
06:28:23.510 --> 06:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to make
 
06:28:25.830 --> 06:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
um we we're we're not in the business of
 
06:28:27.350 --> 06:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
making that determination we're doing as
 
06:28:28.788 --> 06:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
we're told based on what you as a
 
06:28:30.948 --> 06:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
legislature determine as our goals i
 
06:28:33.110 --> 06:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
understand thank you thank you
 
06:28:34.868 --> 06:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
 
06:28:36.868 --> 06:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
creation you have a question
 
06:28:38.310 --> 06:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
06:28:40.868 --> 06:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
question um so you mentioned that some
 
06:28:42.948 --> 06:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
people don't get their system certified
 
06:28:44.548 --> 06:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
to create wrecks because it's just too
 
06:28:47.190 --> 06:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
small is there actually a hard limit on
 
06:28:48.548 --> 06:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
how much
 
06:28:51.270 --> 06:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
energy you need to generate in order to
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
to to produce a wreck there is
 
06:28:55.990 --> 06:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a one megawatt hour
 
06:28:58.310 --> 06:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
right i thought so one megawatt hour and
 
06:28:59.670 --> 06:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about systems that are too
 
06:29:01.190 --> 06:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
small for that
 
06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
so um you know the original goal of the
 
06:29:06.708 --> 06:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund was for that to as
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
much as possible be empty because you
 
06:29:09.590 --> 06:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
were giving the grants out as much as
 
06:29:10.708 --> 06:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
you could get when you got them in you
 
06:29:12.070 --> 06:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
gave them out and the grants are going
 
06:29:13.750 --> 06:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
to create more and more and more
 
06:29:16.070 --> 06:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy so that you're actually
 
06:29:16.080 --> 06:29:17.510 align:start position:0%
renewable energy so that you're actually
uh

06:29:17.510 --> 06:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:29:20.390 --> 06:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
getting to your goals so this was the
 
06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislature's attempt to say okay if
 
06:29:23.910 --> 06:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're if rate payers are putting money
 
06:29:25.110 --> 06:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
into this fund then they should be
 
06:29:26.150 --> 06:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit of all ratepay
 
06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
should be getting a credit for that but
 
06:29:27.600 --> 06:29:29.030 align:start position:0%
should be getting a credit for that but
again

06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:29:30.948 --> 06:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
you heard the sponsor of this bill say
 
06:29:32.708 --> 06:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
that there are other attributes that
 
06:29:34.310 --> 06:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
that matter as well so i leave all that
 
06:29:37.510 --> 06:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:40.468 --> 06:29:40.478 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
06:29:42.708 --> 06:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
i am totally confused
 
06:29:42.718 --> 06:29:44.070 align:start position:0%
i am totally confused
um

06:29:44.070 --> 06:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:46.868 --> 06:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
wrecks and rebates
 
06:29:49.830 --> 06:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
if you and i know intellectual property
 
06:29:51.910 --> 06:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
intellect isn't my thing
 
06:29:53.670 --> 06:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
if you give
 
06:29:56.468 --> 06:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
buy something from someone which you in
 
06:29:57.990 --> 06:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
essence are doing when you give them
 
06:30:00.468 --> 06:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
back credit for that power you are
 
06:30:02.788 --> 06:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
paying them back
 
06:30:05.670 --> 06:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
would you have to
 
06:30:05.680 --> 06:30:07.430 align:start position:0%
would you have to
deduct

06:30:07.430 --> 06:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
deduct
 
06:30:10.468 --> 06:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
the percentage of the power that
 
06:30:10.478 --> 06:30:11.190 align:start position:0%
the percentage of the power that
the

06:30:11.190 --> 06:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:30:13.510 --> 06:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
who paid was paid for
 
06:30:15.190 --> 06:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
from the wreck
 
06:30:15.200 --> 06:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
from the wreck
what's

06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
what's
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
available for rex
 
06:30:20.788 --> 06:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
and that's just the way my convoluted
 
06:30:23.110 --> 06:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
mind works
 
06:30:25.110 --> 06:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm very sorry to admit that i'm not
 
06:30:27.670 --> 06:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
quite sure i know what the question is
 
06:30:29.510 --> 06:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
if if i
 
06:30:31.830 --> 06:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
you have power i produce a mega water
 
06:30:31.840 --> 06:30:33.270 align:start position:0%
you have power i produce a mega water
power

06:30:33.270 --> 06:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
power
 
06:30:35.590 --> 06:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
you are going to rebate me through neck
 
06:30:35.600 --> 06:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
you are going to rebate me through neck
metering

06:30:39.510 --> 06:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:41.990 --> 06:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
are you gonna deduct the 20
 
06:30:45.270 --> 06:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
from what's eligible for a wreck
 
06:30:49.030 --> 06:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
no no but should you that's just good
 
06:30:50.868 --> 06:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
question that's a good question that i
 
06:30:54.948 --> 06:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's it

so much mr chair and members of the
 
06:31:44.230 --> 06:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee i promise to be brief seeing
 
06:31:45.910 --> 06:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
as we're on a time crunch
 
06:31:47.350 --> 06:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i've already submitted written
 
06:31:49.270 --> 06:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
testimony to you today
 
06:31:51.270 --> 06:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
i am here before you and for the record
 
06:31:53.350 --> 06:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
my name is kelly buchanan i'm director
 
06:31:55.270 --> 06:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
of legislative and regulatory affairs
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
for clean energy new hampshire and we
 
06:32:00.628 --> 06:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
are in support of house bill 1645.
 
06:32:02.468 --> 06:32:02.478 align:start position:0%
i know today that we've spoken about uh
 
06:32:04.230 --> 06:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
briefly the the original intent of the
 
06:32:06.150 --> 06:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment um that's been
 
06:32:08.390 --> 06:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
described regarding elimination of rex
 
06:32:10.310 --> 06:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
sweeping um clean energy in new
 
06:32:12.868 --> 06:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire is supportive of either option
 
06:32:14.310 --> 06:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
06:32:16.390 --> 06:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a very brief step back
 
06:32:17.910 --> 06:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
and have a little bit of more of an
 
06:32:19.910 --> 06:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
elementary discussion of the renewable
 
06:32:21.990 --> 06:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard and it really is new
 
06:32:23.910 --> 06:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire's only policy to promote
 
06:32:25.830 --> 06:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
renewable energy in the state and we see
 
06:32:27.510 --> 06:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
that as important because it can help
 
06:32:29.590 --> 06:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
grow our clean tech economy create
 
06:32:31.430 --> 06:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
high-paying jobs and promote our energy
 
06:32:33.190 --> 06:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
independence and so
 
06:32:35.190 --> 06:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
under the rps the utilities as we've
 
06:32:37.590 --> 06:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
heard are required to procure
 
06:32:39.830 --> 06:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
these renewable energy credits from four
 
06:32:41.910 --> 06:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
separate classes of renewable energy and
 
06:32:43.830 --> 06:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
that creates a wreck market and so we
 
06:32:46.390 --> 06:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
need two things for a healthy rec market
 
06:32:48.150 --> 06:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that's a strong annual percentage
 
06:32:50.548 --> 06:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
goal for each of those four classes and
 
06:32:52.468 --> 06:32:52.478 align:start position:0%
then also that elimination of rec
 
06:32:55.270 --> 06:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
sweeping which we see is problematic
 
06:32:56.708 --> 06:32:56.718 align:start position:0%
so that occurs is what has been
 
06:32:58.310 --> 06:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
previously discussed is when the
 
06:32:58.320 --> 06:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
previously discussed is when the
utilities

06:32:59.590 --> 06:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
06:33:02.628 --> 06:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
get those credits for free um and
 
06:33:03.830 --> 06:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
use them
 
06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
against their compliance for the rps and
 
06:33:06.240 --> 06:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
against their compliance for the rps and
so

06:33:07.030 --> 06:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:08.628 --> 06:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of diverse reasons
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
for why not all customer generators
 
06:33:13.430 --> 06:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
register to sell their wrecks some
 
06:33:15.110 --> 06:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
simply aren't aware of it it's usually
 
06:33:17.270 --> 06:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
up to the installer to notify people of
 
06:33:19.190 --> 06:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
what they're able to do
 
06:33:21.030 --> 06:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
others you know it's just one more thing
 
06:33:22.708 --> 06:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
that they have to do in terms of getting
 
06:33:24.390 --> 06:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
that special meter and registering and
 
06:33:26.468 --> 06:33:26.478 align:start position:0%
all of that paying an aggregator
 
06:33:29.030 --> 06:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the case of smaller projects so
 
06:33:30.948 --> 06:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's all concerning to us but we're
 
06:33:33.430 --> 06:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
also concerned because in terms of wreck
 
06:33:35.190 --> 06:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
sweeping when a utility is able to
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
secure those racks without having to pay
 
06:33:39.510 --> 06:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
for their cost that does distort the
 
06:33:41.990 --> 06:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
market for especially class 2 we've seen
 
06:33:43.750 --> 06:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the past and this causes a market
 
06:33:46.628 --> 06:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
distortion where prices can collapse
 
06:33:49.190 --> 06:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we find that house bill 1645 is
 
06:33:51.030 --> 06:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure that we close the
 
06:33:53.110 --> 06:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
rec sweeping loophole and ensure
 
06:33:55.190 --> 06:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
customers are able to be more aware of
 
06:33:57.510 --> 06:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunities available to them to
 
06:33:59.350 --> 06:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
secure those racks and to be able to
 
06:34:01.350 --> 06:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
sell them on the market so i would be
 
06:34:02.948 --> 06:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions although i
 
06:34:04.390 --> 06:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
know we've discussed the topic at length
 
06:34:06.548 --> 06:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
today already
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions for ms
 
06:34:09.120 --> 06:34:11.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions for ms
buchanan

06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
buchanan
 
06:34:13.270 --> 06:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
06:34:15.910 --> 06:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you mr
 
06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
buchanan for your testimony
 
06:34:19.670 --> 06:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
the question i have is you mentioned
 
06:34:23.830 --> 06:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
about uh class two wrecks collapsing
 
06:34:26.310 --> 06:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
that that the the market so i think that
 
06:34:28.150 --> 06:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's something that a lot of folks on
 
06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
the committee might benefit from more
 
06:34:31.670 --> 06:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
information about so can you say
 
06:34:33.910 --> 06:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
something about the value of the wrecks
 
06:34:36.070 --> 06:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and how you see that
 
06:34:38.548 --> 06:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
being affected by this bill
 
06:34:41.110 --> 06:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
sure so it's it's i likened it to basic
 
06:34:42.628 --> 06:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
economics essentially when there's
 
06:34:44.310 --> 06:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's a product in the market that the
 
06:34:46.310 --> 06:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
the purchaser is getting for free
 
06:34:48.230 --> 06:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're just incentivized to pay for
 
06:34:50.070 --> 06:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
them at the cost and so the price
 
06:34:52.628 --> 06:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
overall decreases
 
06:34:54.070 --> 06:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
06:34:55.830 --> 06:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
they've gone as low as five dollars per
 
06:34:58.150 --> 06:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour for class two for example
 
06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so that's concerning to us and we
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the wreck market
 
06:35:04.948 --> 06:35:04.958 align:start position:0%
and the intention of the rps to promote
 
06:35:07.670 --> 06:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy development is um
 
06:35:09.670 --> 06:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
secured through this elimination of rec
 
06:35:09.680 --> 06:35:12.548 align:start position:0%
secured through this elimination of rec
sweeping

06:35:12.548 --> 06:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:14.230 --> 06:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned as low as five i'm
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
afraid i'm not sure of what you know a
 
06:35:22.070 --> 06:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
healthy wreck market for
 
06:35:23.830 --> 06:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
a class two license would be so could
 
06:35:25.270 --> 06:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
you say anything about
 
06:35:27.270 --> 06:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know if that's low how low is that
 
06:35:29.110 --> 06:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
or what what what would be
 
06:35:31.510 --> 06:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh desirable in the state of new
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire because we don't know that's a
 
06:35:34.708 --> 06:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
good question and frankly i need to go
 
06:35:35.990 --> 06:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
back and find out for you but i'd be
 
06:35:37.750 --> 06:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up with the committee
 
06:35:37.760 --> 06:35:39.750 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up with the committee
thanks

06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
06:35:41.910 --> 06:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you seeing no further
 
06:35:47.190 --> 06:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:48.788 --> 06:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move on otherwise we're
 
06:35:52.628 --> 06:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:54.628 --> 06:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
all right representative samsit i'll
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i believe that
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
the prices are different in new england
 
06:36:03.360 --> 06:36:04.628 align:start position:0%
the prices are different in new england
states

06:36:04.628 --> 06:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:36:06.708 --> 06:36:06.718 align:start position:0%
when i sell my solar wrecks into the
 
06:36:09.750 --> 06:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
connecticut market i get like 30 dollars
 
06:36:11.670 --> 06:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
good point representative that is
 
06:36:11.680 --> 06:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
good point representative that is
correct

06:36:13.030 --> 06:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:36:14.628 --> 06:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
we are competing with other states that
 
06:36:18.230 --> 06:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:19.990 --> 06:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
more okay thank you ms mccann and that
 
06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't a question so
 
06:36:23.830 --> 06:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
06:36:25.430 --> 06:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions we thank you
 
06:36:27.510 --> 06:36:27.520 align:start position:0%

06:37:25.750 --> 06:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:27.430 --> 06:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
06:37:27.440 --> 06:37:28.948 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
um

06:37:28.948 --> 06:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:31.030 --> 06:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
let me get back up a little bit on this
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill is supposed to do is to
 
06:37:35.510 --> 06:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
help the implementation of the new
 
06:37:37.110 --> 06:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
department of energy i think as many
 
06:37:38.548 --> 06:37:38.558 align:start position:0%
people realize
 
06:37:40.548 --> 06:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
uh during the budget bill last year in
 
06:37:43.590 --> 06:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 there was a reorg which drastically
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
affected the puc and created a new
 
06:37:47.270 --> 06:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
department of energy and affected other
 
06:37:48.948 --> 06:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
departments as well
 
06:37:50.708 --> 06:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
and as that was
 
06:37:52.390 --> 06:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
went through kind of fast and there
 
06:37:55.190 --> 06:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lot of public input into it
 
06:37:58.390 --> 06:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
and it's a in fact is it was the best
 
06:37:59.670 --> 06:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
attempt but
 
06:38:01.030 --> 06:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
the people of the department of energy
 
06:38:02.230 --> 06:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
have learned that some of the things
 
06:38:03.910 --> 06:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
that were done need to be corrected
 
06:38:05.670 --> 06:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
changed whatever to make the system make
 
06:38:07.670 --> 06:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
the whole department more workable as
 
06:38:09.030 --> 06:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
you would expect when a brand new
 
06:38:10.868 --> 06:38:10.878 align:start position:0%
department has
 
06:38:13.590 --> 06:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
been formed and it's also trying to
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the existing department
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
that some of this is going to be learned
 
06:38:19.750 --> 06:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
as you go
 
06:38:22.708 --> 06:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
so this bill was our first attempt
 
06:38:24.868 --> 06:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
having met with the people from the puc
 
06:38:26.468 --> 06:38:26.478 align:start position:0%
in the department of energy and you'll
 
06:38:30.468 --> 06:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
see there's numerous changes in here
 
06:38:32.548 --> 06:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
but we've also had subsequent meetings
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
from that
 
06:38:35.750 --> 06:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we've decided it's been decided that
 
06:38:37.030 --> 06:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
would probably make some additional
 
06:38:38.548 --> 06:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
changes to a few things there's been
 
06:38:41.670 --> 06:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
some conflicts contradictions found that
 
06:38:43.670 --> 06:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh need to be corrected
 
06:38:46.070 --> 06:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm not presenting amendment today or
 
06:38:48.390 --> 06:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
bringing anything up as specific as that
 
06:38:50.468 --> 06:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
other than behind me people will speak
 
06:38:51.910 --> 06:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
from the department of energy they'll be
 
06:38:54.310 --> 06:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
able to go over the specific uh answers
 
06:38:55.990 --> 06:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
to questions and sort of give you the
 
06:38:57.830 --> 06:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
philosophy of where we're heading my
 
06:38:59.430 --> 06:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the chair is that we
 
06:39:01.590 --> 06:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee on this so that we
 
06:39:03.750 --> 06:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
can have more input to come up with a
 
06:39:05.590 --> 06:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
formal amendment that could then be
 
06:39:07.830 --> 06:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward to the entire committee
 
06:39:09.430 --> 06:39:09.440 align:start position:0%

flapping my gums here i'll unless
 
06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%

people from the department of energy
 
06:39:18.310 --> 06:39:18.320 align:start position:0%

subcommittee
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%

06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of this public hearing i'm
 
06:39:35.830 --> 06:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
going to be asking for volunteers to
 
06:39:37.430 --> 06:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
staff that committee which will be
 
06:39:41.030 --> 06:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative harrington

06:39:42.150 --> 06:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:39:44.150 --> 06:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts you have a
 
06:39:46.390 --> 06:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
question it's a question for the chair
 
06:39:49.110 --> 06:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittees will be open to all
 
06:39:50.788 --> 06:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
members they won't be members of the
 
06:39:52.628 --> 06:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
committee but they'll be open
 
06:39:54.390 --> 06:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct there
 
06:39:56.548 --> 06:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
will be five members of the subcommittee
 
06:40:00.310 --> 06:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
who will vote on a recommendation
 
06:40:01.750 --> 06:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
and that will be the motion on the floor
 
06:40:04.310 --> 06:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
when we go to exec session but anybody
 
06:40:06.468 --> 06:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
can attend a subcommittee meeting
 
06:40:08.150 --> 06:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
06:40:11.430 --> 06:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
do we have questions for representative
 
06:40:13.190 --> 06:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
harrington i would suggest that maybe we
 
06:40:15.270 --> 06:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
might want to wait and question members
 
06:40:16.948 --> 06:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
of the department of energy but
 
06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee if you want go
 
06:40:21.110 --> 06:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you mr chairman uh maybe you
 
06:40:23.430 --> 06:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
can answer this for me representative
 
06:40:24.948 --> 06:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at the
 
06:40:27.190 --> 06:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
bolded language on page one that talks
 
06:40:29.510 --> 06:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
about the division conducting an audit
 
06:40:31.270 --> 06:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
related to the operation of the public
 
06:40:33.750 --> 06:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
utilities in the state and i was just
 
06:40:33.760 --> 06:40:34.868 align:start position:0%
utilities in the state and i was just
wondering

06:40:34.868 --> 06:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
06:40:34.878 --> 06:40:35.590 align:start position:0%
wondering
who

06:40:35.590 --> 06:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:40:35.600 --> 06:40:36.708 align:start position:0%
who
who

06:40:36.708 --> 06:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:40:38.708 --> 06:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
among the enforcement agencies in the
 
06:40:40.948 --> 06:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
doe would have the ability or the
 
06:40:40.958 --> 06:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
doe would have the ability or the
capabilities

06:40:42.390 --> 06:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
06:40:45.190 --> 06:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
to do perform an audit of the public
 
06:40:47.350 --> 06:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
utilities because that seems like
 
06:40:49.190 --> 06:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
it seems like an out of scope thing to
 
06:40:51.670 --> 06:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
me i i just i'm not sure what it's there
 
06:40:53.910 --> 06:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
for i will have to defer some of this to
 
06:40:55.750 --> 06:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
the specific people in the department of
 
06:40:57.190 --> 06:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
energy because it is a kind of a fluid
 
06:40:59.030 --> 06:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
system my understanding that at least
 
06:41:00.628 --> 06:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
some of the auditing folks that used to
 
06:41:03.030 --> 06:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
work for the puc now work for the doe
 
06:41:04.390 --> 06:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
some of that responsibility has been
 
06:41:06.150 --> 06:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
transferred and hopefully some of the
 
06:41:08.070 --> 06:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
expertise that went along with them
 
06:41:09.590 --> 06:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
because i know from experience they had
 
06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
a very good auditing department there
 
06:41:13.750 --> 06:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
06:41:15.910 --> 06:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
so for the information of the members of
 
06:41:18.070 --> 06:41:18.080 align:start position:0%

the restructuring of the new hampshire
 
06:42:17.590 --> 06:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the public utilities commission and
 
06:42:18.708 --> 06:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
the creation of the new hampshire
 
06:42:21.430 --> 06:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh in hb2 was a
 
06:42:23.670 --> 06:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
very significant undertaking
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh even during those initial
 
06:42:27.910 --> 06:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
conversations and and that included you
 
06:42:30.468 --> 06:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
know with members of this committee i
 
06:42:30.478 --> 06:42:31.590 align:start position:0%
know with members of this committee i
everyone

06:42:31.590 --> 06:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
agreed that there would likely be the
 
06:42:35.990 --> 06:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
need for additional technical changes
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
after the restructuring restructuring uh
 
06:42:41.350 --> 06:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
settled in and we you know could sort of
 
06:42:43.750 --> 06:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
take the time to look at the effects and
 
06:42:46.230 --> 06:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
come back with some suggestions so house
 
06:42:49.270 --> 06:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill 1258 is the vehicle for those
 
06:42:51.670 --> 06:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
items uh they are for the most part
 
06:42:53.830 --> 06:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
housekeeping items technical changes and
 
06:42:55.910 --> 06:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
clarifications that we think the
 
06:42:58.468 --> 06:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
legislature ought to consider
 
06:43:00.310 --> 06:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
um we've had a number of conversations
 
06:43:02.070 --> 06:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
with uh the bill sponsor representative
 
06:43:04.390 --> 06:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
harrington uh as well as the puc and
 
06:43:06.868 --> 06:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders about um their input
 
06:43:09.510 --> 06:43:09.520 align:start position:0%

included a number of changes and
 
06:43:21.510 --> 06:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know given legislative deadlines to
 
06:43:24.390 --> 06:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
get those in uh those requests for
 
06:43:26.230 --> 06:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
changes have continued to evolve over
 
06:43:29.910 --> 06:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
the succeeding months um you know given
 
06:43:31.750 --> 06:43:31.760 align:start position:0%

for bringing it forward it was quite a
 
06:44:30.000 --> 06:44:31.110 align:start position:0%
for bringing it forward it was quite a
project

06:44:31.110 --> 06:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
project
 
06:44:33.750 --> 06:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
during the budget session to

from that process and they were good
 
06:44:43.510 --> 06:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
enough to
 
06:44:45.750 --> 06:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
bring a general bill forward
 
06:44:47.830 --> 06:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we could work on during this
 
06:44:49.430 --> 06:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
session with
 
06:44:49.440 --> 06:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
session with
stakeholders

06:44:51.270 --> 06:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
06:44:53.750 --> 06:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
that want to participate to clean up
 
06:44:56.310 --> 06:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
those loose ends right so
 
06:44:58.230 --> 06:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
i think just about everything that is
 
06:45:01.110 --> 06:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
suggested uh in in the bill
 
06:45:04.548 --> 06:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
and in the the further amendments that
 
06:45:06.390 --> 06:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
the department would suggest
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
are generally of a housekeeping nature
 
06:45:09.360 --> 06:45:10.548 align:start position:0%
are generally of a housekeeping nature
or

06:45:10.548 --> 06:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:45:12.150 --> 06:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
you might look at
 
06:45:13.510 --> 06:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
at it as
 
06:45:16.150 --> 06:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
in that reorganization
 
06:45:17.990 --> 06:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
people move to the department but the
 
06:45:20.070 --> 06:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
language and the statute didn't match or
 
06:45:22.150 --> 06:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
the language and the statute
 
06:45:24.070 --> 06:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
changed but the people
 
06:45:25.350 --> 06:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
didn't follow
 
06:45:25.360 --> 06:45:26.390 align:start position:0%
didn't follow
right

06:45:26.390 --> 06:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:45:26.400 --> 06:45:27.350 align:start position:0%
right
but

06:45:27.350 --> 06:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:45:29.270 --> 06:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
we believe we understand the general
 
06:45:31.430 --> 06:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
intent of
 
06:45:34.070 --> 06:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
that reorganization and these changes
 
06:45:36.548 --> 06:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
are designed to bring everything in line
 
06:45:36.558 --> 06:45:38.150 align:start position:0%
are designed to bring everything in line
right

06:45:38.150 --> 06:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:45:40.948 --> 06:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
and i will warn you that i've been
 
06:45:42.708 --> 06:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
through this a number of times before
 
06:45:45.590 --> 06:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
and going through each provision of
 
06:45:48.628 --> 06:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed and the
 
06:45:51.830 --> 06:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
nine or ten changes that we're proposing
 
06:45:53.910 --> 06:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
takes about an hour and a half to two
 
06:45:56.310 --> 06:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
and a half hours depending
 
06:46:00.150 --> 06:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
depending on the the questions so
 
06:46:02.868 --> 06:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
i propose that i just point out to you
 
06:46:05.030 --> 06:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of the high points leave this
 
06:46:08.070 --> 06:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
document with you and then that we work
 
06:46:10.948 --> 06:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
with the study commission to put flesh
 
06:46:12.548 --> 06:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
on the bones
 
06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
of all of these suggestions rather than
 
06:46:17.110 --> 06:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
trying to go through it today if you
 
06:46:19.670 --> 06:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
want to do that i'm more than happy to
 
06:46:21.190 --> 06:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
and to answer any questions that you
 
06:46:21.200 --> 06:46:25.510 align:start position:0%
and to answer any questions that you
have

06:46:25.510 --> 06:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:28.310 --> 06:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
but to start out uh some of the
 
06:46:30.390 --> 06:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
important changes that we we would
 
06:46:32.150 --> 06:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
really like to see made
 
06:46:32.160 --> 06:46:33.430 align:start position:0%
really like to see made
are

06:46:33.430 --> 06:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
06:46:35.200 --> 06:46:36.310 align:start position:0%
if you look at
sections

06:46:36.310 --> 06:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
sections
 
06:46:36.320 --> 06:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
sections
8

06:46:37.270 --> 06:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
8
 
06:46:39.430 --> 06:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
9 and 10
 
06:46:40.708 --> 06:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:46:42.548 --> 06:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced
 
06:46:45.670 --> 06:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
these transfer authority
 
06:46:45.680 --> 06:46:47.830 align:start position:0%
these transfer authority
over

06:46:47.830 --> 06:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:46:47.840 --> 06:46:49.030 align:start position:0%
over
utility

06:46:49.030 --> 06:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
utility
 
06:46:52.230 --> 06:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
disconnects and terminations of service
 
06:46:54.468 --> 06:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
and medical disconnections
 
06:46:56.548 --> 06:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
uh all of the
 
06:46:59.830 --> 06:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
sort of consumer protection apparatus
 
06:47:02.390 --> 06:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh and and much of the consumer
 
06:47:04.310 --> 06:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
protection responsibility was
 
06:47:06.310 --> 06:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
transferred to the department
 
06:47:08.548 --> 06:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
under house bill 2
 
06:47:10.948 --> 06:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
all of the people who conduct that work
 
06:47:13.270 --> 06:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
were transferred over to the department
 
06:47:15.270 --> 06:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
06:47:16.868 --> 06:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
not transferring
 
06:47:19.350 --> 06:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
the responsibility under this statute
 
06:47:21.270 --> 06:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
was simply an oversight
 
06:47:23.270 --> 06:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
right so it has the public utilities
 
06:47:24.948 --> 06:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
commission doing things that it doesn't
 
06:47:27.830 --> 06:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
have the rules infrastructure for doing
 
06:47:30.150 --> 06:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
or the staffing to do all of that moved
 
06:47:32.708 --> 06:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
over to the department so even though
 
06:47:36.070 --> 06:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's a full statute that really is
 
06:47:37.910 --> 06:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
in our view a housekeeping matter to
 
06:47:39.030 --> 06:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
have the
 
06:47:42.310 --> 06:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
statute follow where the the
 
06:47:53.430 --> 06:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:56.788 --> 06:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:59.270 --> 06:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have asked for housekeeping in the
 
06:48:02.390 --> 06:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
field of utility assessment
 
06:48:04.788 --> 06:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
so the general responsibility for
 
06:48:07.030 --> 06:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
assessing the utilities for the costs of
 
06:48:11.590 --> 06:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:13.510 --> 06:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
moved to the department
 
06:48:16.548 --> 06:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
but there are numerous stray references
 
06:48:18.628 --> 06:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
in the statute to the commission
 
06:48:20.948 --> 06:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
leaving everybody wondering well who
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
exactly am i supposed to submit this
 
06:48:25.270 --> 06:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
report to or who exactly is going to
 
06:48:27.430 --> 06:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
contact me about that is it going to be
 
06:48:29.510 --> 06:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
the commission or the department so we'd
 
06:48:30.868 --> 06:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
like to make
 
06:48:35.590 --> 06:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:37.350 --> 06:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
we would like to see
 
06:48:42.788 --> 06:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
the state's crossing statute changed so
 
06:48:46.788 --> 06:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
before a utility or a utility type
 
06:48:46.798 --> 06:48:47.990 align:start position:0%
before a utility or a utility type
company

06:48:47.990 --> 06:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
company
 
06:48:48.000 --> 06:48:50.230 align:start position:0%
company
can

06:48:50.230 --> 06:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:48:50.240 --> 06:48:51.270 align:start position:0%
can
cross

06:48:51.270 --> 06:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
cross
 
06:48:54.310 --> 06:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
a state park or a piece of state land or
 
06:48:56.628 --> 06:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
a public water
 
06:48:59.270 --> 06:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
they had to receive a license to do that
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
from the public utilities commission and
 
06:49:02.390 --> 06:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
that was handled
 
06:49:04.868 --> 06:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
in an adjudicative procedure before the
 
06:49:07.750 --> 06:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
06:49:10.868 --> 06:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
that responsibility was split
 
06:49:12.628 --> 06:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
by house bill 2
 
06:49:12.638 --> 06:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
by house bill 2
right

06:49:13.430 --> 06:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:49:13.440 --> 06:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
right
leaving

06:49:14.390 --> 06:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
06:49:17.910 --> 06:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
the department to grant most licenses
 
06:49:20.150 --> 06:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
but when there was disagreement among
 
06:49:22.230 --> 06:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
parties then the public utilities
 
06:49:24.150 --> 06:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
commission would do that
 
06:49:26.628 --> 06:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
but in that process they
 
06:49:30.628 --> 06:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
retained the adjudicative nature
 
06:49:32.628 --> 06:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
of that process through its entirety
 
06:49:34.548 --> 06:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
leaving the department
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
to conduct adjudications at least to
 
06:49:39.110 --> 06:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
determine who the parties were
 
06:49:41.590 --> 06:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
and under our proposal
 
06:49:44.390 --> 06:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
we would like to see
 
06:49:44.400 --> 06:49:45.190 align:start position:0%
we would like to see
that

06:49:45.190 --> 06:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:49:47.910 --> 06:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
licensing be completely
 
06:49:49.910 --> 06:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
um administrative
 
06:49:52.628 --> 06:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
right without an adjudicative proceeding
 
06:49:55.110 --> 06:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
to get to the license itself
 
06:49:57.350 --> 06:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
and then if a hearing is necessary if
 
06:49:58.948 --> 06:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
somebody disagrees
 
06:50:01.030 --> 06:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh with a decision that the department
 
06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:07.350 --> 06:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
there would be an appeal right
 
06:50:08.948 --> 06:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
to the public utilities commission to
 
06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually have that adjudicative
 
06:50:14.628 --> 06:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
proceeding if one is necessary
 
06:50:16.868 --> 06:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
in my experience at the puc
 
06:50:19.830 --> 06:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh those adjudications were hardly
 
06:50:23.910 --> 06:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
ever necessary right um most
 
06:50:25.750 --> 06:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
even even some of the most controversial
 
06:50:27.670 --> 06:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
crossings that you can think of
 
06:50:29.510 --> 06:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
there was no disagreement whatsoever the
 
06:50:31.910 --> 06:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
license was granted and and the crossing
 
06:50:33.270 --> 06:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
was made so
 
06:50:33.280 --> 06:50:35.190 align:start position:0%
was made so
um

06:50:35.190 --> 06:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:38.628 --> 06:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
the adjudication is not really
 
06:50:41.670 --> 06:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
the the major portion of that process
 
06:50:43.590 --> 06:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
the major process is what the department
 
06:50:45.510 --> 06:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
does which is conducting the safety
 
06:50:48.150 --> 06:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
review to make sure that whatever is
 
06:50:50.310 --> 06:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
constructed on state lands
 
06:50:52.948 --> 06:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
or over state waters
 
06:50:55.270 --> 06:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't a fear interfere with the
 
06:50:58.788 --> 06:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
public's use of of that in terms of the
 
06:51:00.948 --> 06:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
public safety right
 
06:51:17.670 --> 06:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:19.270 --> 06:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
so i you know i really think those are
 
06:51:22.070 --> 06:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
the high points everything else is
 
06:51:25.670 --> 06:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
really just housekeeping in nature
 
06:51:28.150 --> 06:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
but you know i'm happy to ask and answer
 
06:51:30.070 --> 06:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
 
06:51:30.080 --> 06:51:30.788 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
yeah

06:51:30.788 --> 06:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:51:30.798 --> 06:51:34.070 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

06:51:34.070 --> 06:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:35.750 --> 06:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
06:51:37.510 --> 06:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:51:40.310 --> 06:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm just looking at the list uh here
 
06:51:42.548 --> 06:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
of requests for statutory amendments and
 
06:51:44.788 --> 06:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at item number four
 
06:51:47.910 --> 06:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh with community power aggregation
 
06:51:49.990 --> 06:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
and it says to
 
06:51:52.390 --> 06:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 53e
 
06:51:52.400 --> 06:51:53.750 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 53e
um

06:51:53.750 --> 06:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:56.070 --> 06:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
and that review of approval of
 
06:51:59.110 --> 06:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the doe would
 
06:52:01.990 --> 06:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh instead of the puc and
 
06:52:03.270 --> 06:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm
 
06:52:06.150 --> 06:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
curious i know you said that there are
 
06:52:06.160 --> 06:52:07.430 align:start position:0%
curious i know you said that there are
um

06:52:07.430 --> 06:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:09.830 --> 06:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
resources from the public utilities
 
06:52:11.590 --> 06:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
commission who have moved over and are
 
06:52:13.350 --> 06:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
now performing
 
06:52:13.360 --> 06:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
now performing
similar

06:52:14.390 --> 06:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
similar
 
06:52:14.400 --> 06:52:15.510 align:start position:0%
similar
functions

06:52:15.510 --> 06:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
functions
 
06:52:18.548 --> 06:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
as i recall when hb 2 went through we
 
06:52:21.990 --> 06:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
had several presentations and there was
 
06:52:24.948 --> 06:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
a discussion a robust discussion about
 
06:52:27.670 --> 06:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
the bright red line between regulatory
 
06:52:27.680 --> 06:52:29.590 align:start position:0%
the bright red line between regulatory
proceedings

06:52:29.590 --> 06:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
06:52:31.910 --> 06:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
which at that time i think rule making
 
06:52:33.430 --> 06:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
is also was considered part of the
 
06:52:35.910 --> 06:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory piece as were adjudicative
 
06:52:35.920 --> 06:52:37.910 align:start position:0%
regulatory piece as were adjudicative
proceedings

06:52:37.910 --> 06:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
06:52:40.548 --> 06:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
there would be a bright red line between
 
06:52:42.788 --> 06:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
um you know the doe which is an agency
 
06:52:44.230 --> 06:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
under the executive branch and the
 
06:52:46.230 --> 06:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory which are
 
06:52:48.788 --> 06:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
were seen as very distinct so that was
 
06:52:50.628 --> 06:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
sort of the guarantee we were given can
 
06:52:53.830 --> 06:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
you explain to us attorney sherlock
 
06:52:56.788 --> 06:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
how some of these statutory requirements
 
06:52:59.270 --> 06:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
to switch those regulatory burdens over
 
06:53:01.590 --> 06:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy
 
06:53:01.600 --> 06:53:03.910 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy
don't

06:53:03.910 --> 06:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:06.548 --> 06:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
like remove that red line
 
06:53:08.948 --> 06:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
06:53:11.350 --> 06:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation number four
 
06:53:13.190 --> 06:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
the specific one that you you've looked
 
06:53:15.110 --> 06:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
at that we're actually continuing to
 
06:53:16.708 --> 06:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
discuss with the public utilities
 
06:53:18.628 --> 06:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
commission they're trying to decide
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
whether that is one that is appropriate
 
06:53:22.070 --> 06:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
for them to keep
 
06:53:22.080 --> 06:53:23.190 align:start position:0%
for them to keep
right

06:53:23.190 --> 06:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:53:24.868 --> 06:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
the reason that we think it's
 
06:53:27.590 --> 06:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the department to do is
 
06:53:29.990 --> 06:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
is it's not really a rate setting
 
06:53:32.868 --> 06:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
function it's it's it's a review of
 
06:53:36.070 --> 06:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
basically an aggregator's plan right
 
06:53:39.590 --> 06:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:42.468 --> 06:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
with some consumer protection aspect to
 
06:53:44.390 --> 06:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
it right and those are functions that
 
06:53:44.400 --> 06:53:45.190 align:start position:0%
it right and those are functions that
are

06:53:45.190 --> 06:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:53:48.548 --> 06:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
are really at the department right now
 
06:53:52.548 --> 06:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
so you know the the department
 
06:53:55.430 --> 06:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
regulates or oversees competitive
 
06:53:58.070 --> 06:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
suppliers and competitive aggregators we
 
06:53:59.830 --> 06:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
didn't see a reason to split off
 
06:54:03.670 --> 06:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
municipal aggregations from that
 
06:54:07.350 --> 06:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
there are some very common themes
 
06:54:08.468 --> 06:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
to the two
 
06:54:10.708 --> 06:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
and to us they just seemed better
 
06:54:13.910 --> 06:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
packaged together right
 
06:54:13.920 --> 06:54:14.708 align:start position:0%
packaged together right
the

06:54:14.708 --> 06:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:54:14.718 --> 06:54:17.430 align:start position:0%
the
commission

06:54:17.430 --> 06:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:20.948 --> 06:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
has looked at a rulemaking right
 
06:54:20.958 --> 06:54:22.788 align:start position:0%
has looked at a rulemaking right
so

06:54:22.788 --> 06:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:24.548 --> 06:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
the staff
 
06:54:24.558 --> 06:54:25.430 align:start position:0%
the staff
had

06:54:25.430 --> 06:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:54:25.440 --> 06:54:26.468 align:start position:0%
had
begun

06:54:26.468 --> 06:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
begun
 
06:54:27.750 --> 06:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
a rulemaking
 
06:54:27.760 --> 06:54:28.548 align:start position:0%
a rulemaking
um

06:54:28.548 --> 06:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:31.430 --> 06:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
some time ago to try and get community
 
06:54:33.110 --> 06:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
aggregation going
 
06:54:36.070 --> 06:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
um house bill 315
 
06:54:39.350 --> 06:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
placed that at the
 
06:54:39.360 --> 06:54:40.948 align:start position:0%
placed that at the
commission

06:54:40.948 --> 06:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:54:43.110 --> 06:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
so we took our product
 
06:54:45.270 --> 06:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
and we petitioned the commission to open
 
06:54:46.548 --> 06:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
a rulemaking
 
06:54:49.110 --> 06:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
to accomplish you know the
 
06:54:50.948 --> 06:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
the legislature's
 
06:54:54.468 --> 06:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
desires or intent and um
 
06:54:54.478 --> 06:54:55.590 align:start position:0%
desires or intent and um
uh

06:54:55.590 --> 06:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:54:59.190 --> 06:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
that is now up to the puc to decide so
 
06:54:59.200 --> 06:55:00.150 align:start position:0%
that is now up to the puc to decide so
um

06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:03.030 --> 06:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
we made a specific proposal and that was
 
06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
all done publicly right um and there
 
06:55:07.510 --> 06:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
were responses to that the commission
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
has decided to
 
06:55:09.840 --> 06:55:10.628 align:start position:0%
has decided to
to

06:55:10.628 --> 06:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:55:11.910 --> 06:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
do something slightly different from
 
06:55:14.310 --> 06:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
what the department proposed so all of
 
06:55:14.320 --> 06:55:15.350 align:start position:0%
what the department proposed so all of
that

06:55:15.350 --> 06:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:55:16.708 --> 06:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
has been handled
 
06:55:16.718 --> 06:55:17.590 align:start position:0%
has been handled
under

06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:55:19.990 --> 06:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
the bright red line if you want to call
 
06:55:21.110 --> 06:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
it that
 
06:55:21.120 --> 06:55:24.230 align:start position:0%
it that
but

06:55:24.230 --> 06:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:26.390 --> 06:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
our thought is that that jurisdiction
 
06:55:28.548 --> 06:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
the whole thing the rule making should
 
06:55:30.788 --> 06:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
come to the department
 
06:55:30.798 --> 06:55:32.070 align:start position:0%
come to the department
right

06:55:32.070 --> 06:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:55:33.190 --> 06:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
so it
 
06:55:34.708 --> 06:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a violation of that bright
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
red line it would just be a change in
 
06:55:38.548 --> 06:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction back over to to the
 
06:55:41.350 --> 06:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
department okay follow-up so
 
06:55:43.110 --> 06:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
06:55:44.948 --> 06:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
06:55:46.788 --> 06:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
i think the other thing that might be
 
06:55:50.310 --> 06:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
helpful in clarifying for this committee
 
06:55:52.150 --> 06:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
where we're going it you know it seems
 
06:55:53.990 --> 06:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
like there's a lot in here to be
 
06:55:56.070 --> 06:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
translated to the department of energy
 
06:55:58.548 --> 06:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
it's a new department that's great but i
 
06:56:00.150 --> 06:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
guess what would be helpful is if you
 
06:56:01.910 --> 06:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
could clarify
 
06:56:04.150 --> 06:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
which jurisdictions remain with the
 
06:56:05.670 --> 06:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission because they
 
06:56:07.830 --> 06:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
had kind of a breadth of
 
06:56:09.750 --> 06:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
06:56:11.430 --> 06:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
rule making you know there was rule
 
06:56:13.110 --> 06:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
making and rate setting and i think a
 
06:56:14.310 --> 06:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
lot of people thought of them as just
 
06:56:17.030 --> 06:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
rate setters but an awful lot of what we
 
06:56:18.548 --> 06:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
tried to throw over the wall for
 
06:56:21.590 --> 06:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussion and decision making
 
06:56:23.030 --> 06:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
would go to the public utilities
 
06:56:25.830 --> 06:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
commission and i think it may confuse us
 
06:56:28.468 --> 06:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
as to what we can send there if we don't
 
06:56:30.628 --> 06:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
understand in a clear way what is the
 
06:56:32.548 --> 06:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission left
 
06:56:34.230 --> 06:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
06:56:37.350 --> 06:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
as a separate entity i guess so um
 
06:56:38.390 --> 06:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
06:56:39.990 --> 06:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
a very good and a very complicated
 
06:56:40.000 --> 06:56:41.350 align:start position:0%
a very good and a very complicated
question

06:56:41.350 --> 06:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:56:41.360 --> 06:56:43.110 align:start position:0%
question
so

06:56:43.110 --> 06:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:46.390 --> 06:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know do i get points you do
 
06:56:46.400 --> 06:56:48.390 align:start position:0%
you know do i get points you do
so

06:56:48.390 --> 06:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:48.400 --> 06:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
so
the

06:56:49.750 --> 06:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:56:49.760 --> 06:56:51.830 align:start position:0%
the
both

06:56:51.830 --> 06:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
both
 
06:56:54.150 --> 06:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
agencies were given general supervisory
 
06:56:57.350 --> 06:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
authority uh over the utilities and and
 
06:56:58.830 --> 06:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
there is some
 
06:57:02.948 --> 06:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
overlap or in many areas some ambiguity
 
06:57:05.590 --> 06:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
as to who has responsibility for what
 
06:57:05.600 --> 06:57:06.548 align:start position:0%
as to who has responsibility for what
and

06:57:06.548 --> 06:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:09.430 --> 06:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
we have been working to sort of tease
 
06:57:11.990 --> 06:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
that apart and and figure out what
 
06:57:15.590 --> 06:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
should be on which side and we've just
 
06:57:17.110 --> 06:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
kicked off a
 
06:57:21.270 --> 06:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:23.350 --> 06:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
where the public utilities commission
 
06:57:23.360 --> 06:57:24.070 align:start position:0%
where the public utilities commission
and

06:57:24.070 --> 06:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:26.230 --> 06:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
the department will be working with the
 
06:57:29.030 --> 06:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
department of justice to
 
06:57:31.190 --> 06:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
sort of conduct that exercise by looking
 
06:57:33.030 --> 06:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
at the existing rules
 
06:57:34.788 --> 06:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
and figuring out
 
06:57:36.948 --> 06:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
under the wording of the statute where
 
06:57:38.868 --> 06:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
those different authorities go
 
06:57:40.788 --> 06:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
and that process is going to take a
 
06:57:40.798 --> 06:57:41.670 align:start position:0%
and that process is going to take a
while

06:57:41.670 --> 06:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
while
 
06:57:44.310 --> 06:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
we expect to have that done uh sometime
 
06:57:46.390 --> 06:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
06:57:48.628 --> 06:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
and perhaps after that there'll be a
 
06:57:50.390 --> 06:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more clarity
 
06:57:52.150 --> 06:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
and everyone will see because i'm sure
 
06:57:53.910 --> 06:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
everyone is curious it's not not just
 
06:57:56.310 --> 06:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
you the utilities wonder well who do we
 
06:57:57.990 --> 06:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
send this report to and who's really
 
06:57:59.350 --> 06:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to tell us what to do and what if
 
06:58:00.708 --> 06:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
the department tells us one thing and
 
06:58:02.708 --> 06:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
the puc tells us another
 
06:58:04.150 --> 06:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully over the next year in the
 
06:58:06.150 --> 06:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
context of that project we'll be able to
 
06:58:08.310 --> 06:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
separate that out a little bit better
 
06:58:10.628 --> 06:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
and and provide some clarity
 
06:58:13.270 --> 06:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately though
 
06:58:14.708 --> 06:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to be up to you where to send
 
06:58:17.110 --> 06:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
things and and anytime you
 
06:58:17.120 --> 06:58:18.390 align:start position:0%
things and and anytime you
you

06:58:18.390 --> 06:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:58:20.310 --> 06:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
someone proposes a bill
 
06:58:21.750 --> 06:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
we will appear
 
06:58:24.310 --> 06:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
right and the puc will probably appear
 
06:58:25.510 --> 06:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
and tell you whether we think that
 
06:58:27.270 --> 06:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate
 
06:58:28.948 --> 06:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
whether it's appropriate to go to the pc
 
06:58:31.030 --> 06:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
or appropriate to come to us and then
 
06:58:33.030 --> 06:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
the decision will ultimately be the
 
06:58:33.040 --> 06:58:34.390 align:start position:0%
the decision will ultimately be the
legislatures

06:58:34.390 --> 06:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
06:58:36.230 --> 06:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
right and and that might be a you know
 
06:58:37.750 --> 06:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
something that happens on a case-by-case
 
06:58:37.760 --> 06:58:39.110 align:start position:0%
something that happens on a case-by-case
basis

06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
basis
 
06:58:41.350 --> 06:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
even after the clarification
 
06:58:41.360 --> 06:58:44.390 align:start position:0%
even after the clarification
right

06:58:44.390 --> 06:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:47.190 --> 06:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative uh
 
06:58:49.110 --> 06:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
did you have a question no
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:56.390 --> 06:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
06:58:58.708 --> 06:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
shulock for being here and commissioner
 
06:58:58.718 --> 06:59:01.270 align:start position:0%
shulock for being here and commissioner
kilms

06:59:01.270 --> 06:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:04.310 --> 06:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i have a lot of questions
 
06:59:06.150 --> 06:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't expect to ask all of them
 
06:59:09.350 --> 06:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
today but um
 
06:59:11.430 --> 06:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
what i really like to hear from you and
 
06:59:11.440 --> 06:59:13.030 align:start position:0%
what i really like to hear from you and
uh

06:59:13.030 --> 06:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:59:14.708 --> 06:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we don't really have
 
06:59:16.628 --> 06:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
enough time to deal with everything you
 
06:59:18.468 --> 06:59:18.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned you could give us a two and a
 
06:59:20.468 --> 06:59:20.478 align:start position:0%
half hour presentation which i'd like to
 
06:59:22.310 --> 06:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
see give to the whole committee and not
 
06:59:24.868 --> 06:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
just the subcommittee because this is
 
06:59:27.510 --> 06:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
these are really important issues so as
 
06:59:30.548 --> 06:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
someone who is very supportive of a
 
06:59:33.190 --> 06:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy being created let
 
06:59:34.390 --> 06:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
me ask you this
 
06:59:37.110 --> 06:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
what what i think what my concerns and
 
06:59:39.990 --> 06:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
and unclarities right now are is
 
06:59:42.390 --> 06:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for what and how does
 
06:59:45.830 --> 06:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
it change um for example will these will
 
06:59:48.708 --> 06:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the puc be
 
06:59:51.590 --> 06:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
kind of independent of each other or is
 
06:59:53.990 --> 06:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
there some kind of a dependency that one
 
06:59:55.670 --> 06:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
will be able to
 
06:59:57.510 --> 06:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
interfere with the activities of the
 
06:59:57.520 --> 06:59:59.110 align:start position:0%
interfere with the activities of the
other

06:59:59.110 --> 06:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:00:01.670 --> 07:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
what areas of the poc that were
 
07:00:04.230 --> 07:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory in nature
 
07:00:07.110 --> 07:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
are somehow going away or being taken
 
07:00:09.990 --> 07:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
over by the department of energy
 
07:00:10.000 --> 07:00:11.350 align:start position:0%
over by the department of energy
and

07:00:11.350 --> 07:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:00:13.990 --> 07:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
how does that affect
 
07:00:14.788 --> 07:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:00:17.430 --> 07:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
us moving forward i understand these are
 
07:00:19.990 --> 07:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
also unresolved questions some of them
 
07:00:23.190 --> 07:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
for you as well uh but you know
 
07:00:24.708 --> 07:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
we're talking we're starting to talk
 
07:00:26.868 --> 07:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
about about nitty gritty details here
 
07:00:29.750 --> 07:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't even understand exactly how
 
07:00:31.350 --> 07:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
what the philosophy is of the
 
07:00:31.360 --> 07:00:33.190 align:start position:0%
what the philosophy is of the
reorganization

07:00:33.190 --> 07:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
07:00:35.910 --> 07:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
what is it for what does it do how is it
 
07:00:38.390 --> 07:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
independent of each other
 
07:00:40.230 --> 07:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
for example can the governor's office
 
07:00:42.390 --> 07:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
have influence on making something
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
happen in one department and not in the
 
07:00:46.948 --> 07:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
other or are they independent enough to
 
07:00:49.590 --> 07:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
to to have the credibility to know
 
07:00:51.110 --> 07:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
07:00:53.110 --> 07:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
as much as possible beyond political
 
07:00:53.120 --> 07:00:55.270 align:start position:0%
as much as possible beyond political
influence

07:00:55.270 --> 07:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
influence
 
07:00:57.990 --> 07:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
um so so i don't think i can answer all
 
07:01:01.990 --> 07:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
of that instead but um the statutes are
 
07:01:05.270 --> 07:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
constructed so that the two agencies are
 
07:01:07.030 --> 07:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
independent agencies
 
07:01:09.590 --> 07:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
right although the puc is
 
07:01:11.830 --> 07:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
07:01:11.840 --> 07:01:14.390 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
department

07:01:14.390 --> 07:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
07:01:14.400 --> 07:01:15.110 align:start position:0%
department
so

07:01:15.110 --> 07:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:01:17.350 --> 07:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
we can't the department
 
07:01:17.360 --> 07:01:18.708 align:start position:0%
we can't the department
cannot

07:01:18.708 --> 07:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
07:01:21.350 --> 07:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
tell the public utilities commission how
 
07:01:23.190 --> 07:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
to decide a case
 
07:01:24.548 --> 07:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
07:01:27.190 --> 07:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
is we will appear in a docket and will
 
07:01:30.708 --> 07:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
present evidence testimony and opinion
 
07:01:33.670 --> 07:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
just like any other party to that docket
 
07:01:35.910 --> 07:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the public utilities commission will
 
07:01:37.830 --> 07:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
decide what to do with that maybe they
 
07:01:40.070 --> 07:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
will agree with it maybe they won't
 
07:01:40.080 --> 07:01:41.270 align:start position:0%
will agree with it maybe they won't
right

07:01:41.270 --> 07:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:01:42.948 --> 07:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
and and they'll fashion their decision
 
07:01:44.390 --> 07:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
as they see fit
 
07:01:44.400 --> 07:01:45.190 align:start position:0%
as they see fit
right

07:01:45.190 --> 07:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:01:45.200 --> 07:01:45.910 align:start position:0%
right
so

07:01:45.910 --> 07:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:01:45.920 --> 07:01:46.788 align:start position:0%
so
uh

07:01:46.788 --> 07:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:01:51.990 --> 07:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:52.000 --> 07:01:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

07:01:53.750 --> 07:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:01:56.070 --> 07:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
way that the restructuring took took
 
07:01:58.948 --> 07:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
place the
 
07:02:01.830 --> 07:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
07:02:01.840 --> 07:02:03.030 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
is

07:02:03.030 --> 07:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:02:05.030 --> 07:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
07:02:07.590 --> 07:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
dependent is not quite the right word
 
07:02:07.600 --> 07:02:08.468 align:start position:0%
dependent is not quite the right word
right

07:02:08.468 --> 07:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:02:11.110 --> 07:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
but there were functions that were at
 
07:02:14.628 --> 07:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
the puc staff members full departments
 
07:02:14.638 --> 07:02:15.990 align:start position:0%
the puc staff members full departments
of

07:02:15.990 --> 07:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:02:18.310 --> 07:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
filled with economists and raid analysts
 
07:02:18.320 --> 07:02:19.110 align:start position:0%
filled with economists and raid analysts
and

07:02:19.110 --> 07:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:02:22.468 --> 07:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
utility analysts etc right
 
07:02:25.030 --> 07:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
who would look at a utilities filing
 
07:02:27.190 --> 07:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
analyze it prepare testimony and present
 
07:02:30.788 --> 07:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:33.030 --> 07:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
the commission no longer has that staff
 
07:02:35.270 --> 07:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
that staff is at the department and the
 
07:02:37.190 --> 07:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
way that that staff now interacts with
 
07:02:39.030 --> 07:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
the commission is through those
 
07:02:41.990 --> 07:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings
 
07:02:43.510 --> 07:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's how they
 
07:02:45.190 --> 07:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
communicate in an adjudicative
 
07:02:47.590 --> 07:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding is in filings or in the
 
07:02:48.708 --> 07:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
hearing room
 
07:02:51.350 --> 07:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
right so
 
07:02:53.990 --> 07:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
there there is some
 
07:02:55.830 --> 07:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
some need for us
 
07:02:58.788 --> 07:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
right to have
 
07:03:01.190 --> 07:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
the the commission gets a view that is
 
07:03:02.708 --> 07:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
independent of the utilities
 
07:03:06.708 --> 07:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
presentation um in in those dockets
 
07:03:09.670 --> 07:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
but they don't tell us what our view is
 
07:03:11.990 --> 07:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we can't tell them what their order
 
07:03:14.868 --> 07:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
has to say right we just do our work we
 
07:03:16.310 --> 07:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
provide them with the opinion and the
 
07:03:18.150 --> 07:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
evidence and and they do what what they
 
07:03:21.350 --> 07:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
need to do so there's that relationship
 
07:03:23.510 --> 07:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
and and you might look at it as some
 
07:03:25.910 --> 07:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
kind of dependency but
 
07:03:27.910 --> 07:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
we were really
 
07:03:31.030 --> 07:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
independent agencies with our own
 
07:03:32.948 --> 07:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
missions right
 
07:03:34.708 --> 07:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
can you refresh our memory how many
 
07:03:37.110 --> 07:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
people are currently working at the puc
 
07:03:40.788 --> 07:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:42.150 --> 07:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
chris might be able to give exact
 
07:03:42.160 --> 07:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
chris might be able to give exact
numbers

07:03:43.270 --> 07:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
07:03:45.830 --> 07:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
oh yeah the exact numbers um i i don't
 
07:03:48.628 --> 07:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
have that for the puc for uh
 
07:03:50.948 --> 07:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
the department of energy uh the position
 
07:03:52.948 --> 07:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
count is somewhere uh in the
 
07:03:55.670 --> 07:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of the low 70s we do have a
 
07:03:58.310 --> 07:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
number of vacancies as do many state
 
07:04:00.390 --> 07:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
agencies obviously it's a
 
07:04:03.030 --> 07:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult workforce time but uh
 
07:04:04.788 --> 07:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're built to i
 
07:04:06.468 --> 07:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
believe the puc is somewhere in the
 
07:04:09.190 --> 07:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 20 but they could
 
07:04:10.948 --> 07:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
provide that information thank you i
 
07:04:12.788 --> 07:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative kelly
 
07:04:14.548 --> 07:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
pitts has a question oh i'm sorry did
 
07:04:16.708 --> 07:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
you have something to say so
 
07:04:18.548 --> 07:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
it's sort of related so
 
07:04:18.558 --> 07:04:20.868 align:start position:0%
it's sort of related so
the

07:04:20.868 --> 07:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:23.590 --> 07:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
the the commission has six senior
 
07:04:23.600 --> 07:04:24.788 align:start position:0%
the the commission has six senior
advisors

07:04:24.788 --> 07:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
advisors
 
07:04:24.798 --> 07:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
advisors
now

07:04:25.670 --> 07:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:04:25.680 --> 07:04:26.628 align:start position:0%
now
um

07:04:26.628 --> 07:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:26.638 --> 07:04:28.868 align:start position:0%
um
who

07:04:28.868 --> 07:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
who
 
07:04:31.430 --> 07:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
can help them figure out
 
07:04:31.440 --> 07:04:33.030 align:start position:0%
can help them figure out
what

07:04:33.030 --> 07:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
07:04:36.150 --> 07:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
the department and all the other parties
 
07:04:36.160 --> 07:04:37.270 align:start position:0%
the department and all the other parties
mean

07:04:37.270 --> 07:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
mean
 
07:04:38.708 --> 07:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
right what their what their evidence
 
07:04:41.750 --> 07:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
means they have a they do have a staff
 
07:04:44.230 --> 07:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
to help assist them it's just much
 
07:04:44.240 --> 07:04:45.430 align:start position:0%
to help assist them it's just much
smaller

07:04:45.430 --> 07:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
07:04:47.350 --> 07:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
um and
 
07:04:49.990 --> 07:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
probably will not be capable of doing
 
07:04:52.070 --> 07:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
all the numbers crunching and and such
 
07:04:54.390 --> 07:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
that the department does right but they
 
07:04:58.310 --> 07:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
they do have some staff to advise them
 
07:05:00.150 --> 07:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
07:05:00.160 --> 07:05:02.628 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
bits

07:05:02.628 --> 07:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:04.948 --> 07:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
this is my day for confusion i'm gonna
 
07:05:08.830 --> 07:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:10.628 --> 07:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
um i
 
07:05:10.638 --> 07:05:12.628 align:start position:0%
um i
envisioned

07:05:12.628 --> 07:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
envisioned
 
07:05:14.390 --> 07:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
the department of energy as being the
 
07:05:14.400 --> 07:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
the department of energy as being the
planning

07:05:15.510 --> 07:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
planning
 
07:05:17.990 --> 07:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the sort of pushing where we go as
 
07:05:20.548 --> 07:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
far as energy goes agency
 
07:05:24.548 --> 07:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
and now i seem to have in my mind
 
07:05:27.030 --> 07:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
four balls in the air the puc the
 
07:05:29.430 --> 07:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy the sec and the
 
07:05:31.510 --> 07:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
07:05:33.510 --> 07:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
and they're hanging there
 
07:05:36.788 --> 07:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
and to be quite honest i don't know why
 
07:05:41.110 --> 07:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
one of the questions i have is who funds
 
07:05:42.948 --> 07:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
07:05:44.548 --> 07:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
and the puc
 
07:05:47.430 --> 07:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
the consumer advocate and the sec can
 
07:05:49.510 --> 07:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
you tell me that just
 
07:05:53.270 --> 07:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
who okay so the um
 
07:05:55.910 --> 07:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
the office of consumer advocate is
 
07:05:58.468 --> 07:05:58.478 align:start position:0%
completely funded by utility assessment
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
right so you
 
07:06:02.788 --> 07:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
we all pay for that as
 
07:06:05.350 --> 07:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
through our utility bills right
 
07:06:07.590 --> 07:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
um the
 
07:06:10.150 --> 07:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh department of energy is funded by the
 
07:06:12.868 --> 07:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
utility assessment and by some federal
 
07:06:15.110 --> 07:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
special federal funding you know for
 
07:06:17.350 --> 07:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
special product projects the laihe
 
07:06:19.910 --> 07:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
project etc there are a number of those
 
07:06:22.788 --> 07:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
but those are the only two sources is
 
07:06:24.548 --> 07:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
07:06:26.948 --> 07:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
oh rps funding as well right
 
07:06:26.958 --> 07:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
oh rps funding as well right
um

07:06:28.070 --> 07:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:30.150 --> 07:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
um those are the only two sources of our
 
07:06:32.150 --> 07:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
operating or three sources of our
 
07:06:35.030 --> 07:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
operating revenue right the
 
07:06:35.040 --> 07:06:36.390 align:start position:0%
operating revenue right the
sec

07:06:36.390 --> 07:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
sec
 
07:06:39.350 --> 07:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
is funded by applicant fees
 
07:06:41.270 --> 07:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i think now
 
07:06:43.190 --> 07:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
the general fund there's some small
 
07:06:49.750 --> 07:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:52.310 --> 07:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
07:06:52.320 --> 07:06:53.030 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
so

07:06:53.030 --> 07:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:06:56.788 --> 07:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
again from what i'm hearing and what i'm
 
07:06:58.468 --> 07:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
ingesting i would love to see your
 
07:07:00.830 --> 07:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
presentation by the way
 
07:07:05.110 --> 07:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
what it seems to me that the consumer
 
07:07:07.590 --> 07:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
the utility pays the consumer pace the
 
07:07:10.788 --> 07:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
consumer is now paying for two energy
 
07:07:10.798 --> 07:07:11.750 align:start position:0%
consumer is now paying for two energy
two

07:07:11.750 --> 07:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:07:13.750 --> 07:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
agencies or three
 
07:07:15.190 --> 07:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
that are doing
 
07:07:17.750 --> 07:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
almost exactly the same work
 
07:07:20.310 --> 07:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
and really haven't figured it out yet
 
07:07:22.150 --> 07:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
and every every
 
07:07:24.468 --> 07:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
increment of a year that we go a month
 
07:07:26.468 --> 07:07:26.478 align:start position:0%
two months three months that nobody that
 
07:07:29.030 --> 07:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
you can't figure out what you're doing
 
07:07:31.910 --> 07:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem because the
 
07:07:34.310 --> 07:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
consumer is paying for that that cost is
 
07:07:35.830 --> 07:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
passed on
 
07:07:35.840 --> 07:07:37.270 align:start position:0%
passed on
and

07:07:37.270 --> 07:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:07:38.868 --> 07:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
i i guess
 
07:07:38.878 --> 07:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
i i guess
when

07:07:40.070 --> 07:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
when
 
07:07:43.350 --> 07:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why it seemed again
 
07:07:48.628 --> 07:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:51.030 --> 07:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
is being slowly
 
07:07:51.040 --> 07:07:52.310 align:start position:0%
is being slowly
dissolved

07:07:52.310 --> 07:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
dissolved
 
07:07:52.320 --> 07:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
dissolved
and

07:07:53.510 --> 07:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:07:55.830 --> 07:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
that may not be true
 
07:07:58.868 --> 07:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
but that's how it appears to me
 
07:08:01.110 --> 07:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
right now okay
 
07:08:03.750 --> 07:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
07:08:05.910 --> 07:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
my personal view is that the
 
07:08:08.070 --> 07:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
public utilities commissioner or public
 
07:08:09.830 --> 07:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
07:08:12.708 --> 07:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
has a smaller role than it used to
 
07:08:15.750 --> 07:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that it is leaner and meaner
 
07:08:18.788 --> 07:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
or will be meaner shortly after they
 
07:08:20.948 --> 07:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
staff up right they they still have some
 
07:08:25.270 --> 07:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:27.830 --> 07:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
many of the things
 
07:08:30.390 --> 07:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
that were stripped out of that role
 
07:08:31.910 --> 07:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
have come over to the department they
 
07:08:33.190 --> 07:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
were always done
 
07:08:35.190 --> 07:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
they still need to be done they're just
 
07:08:37.670 --> 07:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to be done by a different agency
 
07:08:40.948 --> 07:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
and we're doing our very best to ensure
 
07:08:43.750 --> 07:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
that there will be no duplication of any
 
07:08:47.430 --> 07:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
efforts in that process and that that is
 
07:08:49.190 --> 07:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's going to go on
 
07:08:51.750 --> 07:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
in this rules project that we're
 
07:08:55.910 --> 07:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
doing this year when we divide the rules
 
07:08:58.230 --> 07:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be able
 
07:09:01.110 --> 07:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
to sh to show everybody that some things
 
07:09:03.030 --> 07:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
are going to the public utilities
 
07:09:04.548 --> 07:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
commission and some things are going to
 
07:09:07.270 --> 07:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
the department and that there's
 
07:09:08.788 --> 07:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
there isn't as much there won't be as
 
07:09:10.468 --> 07:09:10.478 align:start position:0%
much overlap
 
07:09:10.478 --> 07:09:11.350 align:start position:0%
much overlap
in

07:09:11.350 --> 07:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:09:14.628 --> 07:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
the actions of the two agencies as there
 
07:09:16.150 --> 07:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
might appear to be
 
07:09:17.830 --> 07:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the statutes
 
07:09:19.590 --> 07:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
right so
 
07:09:21.110 --> 07:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through that
 
07:09:22.948 --> 07:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
that exercise this year and try and
 
07:09:25.430 --> 07:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
divide those things we're very cognizant
 
07:09:27.350 --> 07:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we don't want to
 
07:09:27.360 --> 07:09:29.270 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we don't want to
duplicate

07:09:29.270 --> 07:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
duplicate
 
07:09:29.280 --> 07:09:30.708 align:start position:0%
duplicate
anything

07:09:30.708 --> 07:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
anything
 
07:09:30.718 --> 07:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
anything
and

07:09:33.750 --> 07:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:35.670 --> 07:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
we'll just do our best to try and make
 
07:09:40.788 --> 07:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:42.230 --> 07:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
i just want to push back a little bit on
 
07:09:44.070 --> 07:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
the characterization that you know
 
07:09:45.990 --> 07:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
things aren't getting done you know
 
07:09:48.708 --> 07:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
docket work continues our division of
 
07:09:51.670 --> 07:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory support continues uh you know
 
07:09:54.310 --> 07:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
to present the state's position uh in
 
07:09:57.030 --> 07:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
those puc proceedings orders are you
 
07:09:59.190 --> 07:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
know moving forward that work is is
 
07:10:01.590 --> 07:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
happening at the puc so regardless of
 
07:10:03.350 --> 07:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
your opinion on on
 
07:10:06.070 --> 07:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know the the content of that policy
 
07:10:07.910 --> 07:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
what comes out of those orders that that
 
07:10:09.430 --> 07:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
work is happening and that is something
 
07:10:10.948 --> 07:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
where the department has
 
07:10:13.590 --> 07:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
is is working um you know full on to
 
07:10:16.310 --> 07:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
help help support that process
 
07:10:19.270 --> 07:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to respond
 
07:10:20.788 --> 07:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
07:10:23.590 --> 07:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
remember we're not here to debate i was
 
07:10:23.600 --> 07:10:24.390 align:start position:0%
remember we're not here to debate i was
people

07:10:24.390 --> 07:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:10:27.030 --> 07:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
presentation regardless of my opinion i
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
was referred to directly so i would
 
07:10:31.910 --> 07:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to respond if you have
 
07:10:33.990 --> 07:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
a question you can respond but my
 
07:10:35.990 --> 07:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
question do not engage in a debate my
 
07:10:38.230 --> 07:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
question is did i ever say that that
 
07:10:43.030 --> 07:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:45.270 --> 07:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay we'll let that one go that's a
 
07:10:48.310 --> 07:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question
 
07:10:50.310 --> 07:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for mr
 
07:10:52.390 --> 07:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
shulock and mr
 
07:10:52.400 --> 07:10:54.150 align:start position:0%
shulock and mr
elms

07:10:54.150 --> 07:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
elms
 
07:10:59.190 --> 07:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:01.590 --> 07:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious there's a lot in this
 
07:11:05.110 --> 07:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh another heading of energy
 
07:11:08.070 --> 07:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
other than just running the show um
 
07:11:10.230 --> 07:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's policy we've got climate change
 
07:11:12.390 --> 07:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
worries uh
 
07:11:14.708 --> 07:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
um there's energy efficiency things like
 
07:11:16.788 --> 07:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
that are you having any
 
07:11:19.910 --> 07:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
role in any of those kinds of issues
 
07:11:21.910 --> 07:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so uh the department of
 
07:11:24.230 --> 07:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
energy has a very varied role in terms
 
07:11:28.310 --> 07:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the various aspects of energy uh
 
07:11:30.310 --> 07:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire our division of policy
 
07:11:33.430 --> 07:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
and programs uh administers a number of
 
07:11:35.590 --> 07:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
federal programs uh our fuel assistance
 
07:11:37.430 --> 07:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
program our weatherization assistance
 
07:11:37.440 --> 07:11:39.430 align:start position:0%
program our weatherization assistance
program

07:11:39.430 --> 07:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:11:41.910 --> 07:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
i don't mean that i mean strategy what's
 
07:11:43.670 --> 07:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's strategy going to be
 
07:11:45.830 --> 07:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
well so also within that division uh
 
07:11:47.750 --> 07:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
they have been charged through hb2 with
 
07:11:48.948 --> 07:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
the development of the new hampshire
 
07:11:51.350 --> 07:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
state energy strategy the update to
 
07:11:53.030 --> 07:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh the 2018
 
07:11:55.510 --> 07:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
state energy strategy so that work is
 
07:11:58.230 --> 07:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward within that division
 
07:12:00.310 --> 07:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
we have a number of other
 
07:12:02.868 --> 07:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
aspects our enforcement division handles
 
07:12:05.830 --> 07:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know aspects related to safety
 
07:12:08.628 --> 07:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
we have a consumer group who
 
07:12:11.430 --> 07:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
looks to consumer protection resolving
 
07:12:13.830 --> 07:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
disputes between consumers
 
07:12:16.788 --> 07:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
related to their utility service
 
07:12:18.230 --> 07:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
our our
 
07:12:20.310 --> 07:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know division of administration
 
07:12:23.350 --> 07:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
works you know contains the division or
 
07:12:25.910 --> 07:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
the department's uh investigations and
 
07:12:27.350 --> 07:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
audit staff
 
07:12:28.868 --> 07:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
so there is a very
 
07:12:31.510 --> 07:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
wide variety of non-regulatory functions
 
07:12:33.190 --> 07:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
that fall within the department of
 
07:12:33.200 --> 07:12:35.350 align:start position:0%
that fall within the department of
energy

07:12:35.350 --> 07:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
energy
 
07:12:38.468 --> 07:12:38.478 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes i what but you know the
 
07:12:40.868 --> 07:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
overall strategy for example the energy
 
07:12:43.830 --> 07:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
strategy from 2014
 
07:12:45.990 --> 07:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
was done with a very uh
 
07:12:48.548 --> 07:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
very very strong
 
07:12:51.910 --> 07:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
um multifaceted effort with all kinds of
 
07:12:55.110 --> 07:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
consultants helping and so on the 2018
 
07:12:57.110 --> 07:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
comes by and there's guys going around
 
07:12:58.390 --> 07:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
with a
 
07:13:01.110 --> 07:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
clipboard having listening sessions and
 
07:13:03.750 --> 07:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
the guy is scribbling on his
 
07:13:06.468 --> 07:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
on his clipboard and
 
07:13:11.350 --> 07:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:12.868 --> 07:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
strategy which
 
07:13:14.310 --> 07:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
several of us thought was just
 
07:13:16.548 --> 07:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
abominable remember we're here to ask
 
07:13:16.558 --> 07:13:21.990 align:start position:0%
abominable remember we're here to ask
questions

07:13:21.990 --> 07:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:24.310 --> 07:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh who's where's the strategy going to
 
07:13:25.430 --> 07:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
come from
 
07:13:27.990 --> 07:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
what i mean
 
07:13:31.750 --> 07:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:31.760 --> 07:13:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
just

07:13:32.830 --> 07:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:13:34.150 --> 07:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
updating the
 
07:13:38.548 --> 07:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
2018 to the 2022 strategy is not
 
07:13:42.868 --> 07:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
nowhere near the the the
 
07:13:45.190 --> 07:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
the magnitude the importance that was
 
07:13:47.750 --> 07:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
put into the 2014.
 
07:13:48.788 --> 07:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:13:51.430 --> 07:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
just this sounds like continuing on with
 
07:13:53.830 --> 07:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
sort of administratively
 
07:13:55.750 --> 07:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
um representative man please let him
 
07:13:57.750 --> 07:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
answer the question i'm trying to find
 
07:13:59.670 --> 07:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
out i'm trying to ask a question let him
 
07:14:01.750 --> 07:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
answer it please i'm trying to ask if
 
07:14:03.430 --> 07:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
07:14:06.708 --> 07:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
strategic thinking or are we basically
 
07:14:08.390 --> 07:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to just kind of keep things going
 
07:14:09.990 --> 07:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
the way they've been going so it is
 
07:14:12.468 --> 07:14:12.478 align:start position:0%
certainly the department's intention to
 
07:14:14.628 --> 07:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh craft the revision to the state
 
07:14:17.110 --> 07:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
energy strategy in a strategic way
 
07:14:17.120 --> 07:14:18.150 align:start position:0%
energy strategy in a strategic way
um

07:14:18.150 --> 07:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:19.910 --> 07:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
07:14:19.920 --> 07:14:21.190 align:start position:0%
regardless of
various

07:14:21.190 --> 07:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
various
 
07:14:23.430 --> 07:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
policy or ideological feelings towards
 
07:14:26.150 --> 07:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
either the 2014 or 2018 strategy i will
 
07:14:29.110 --> 07:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
point out that the 2014 strategy
 
07:14:31.110 --> 07:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
was given to at the time the office of
 
07:14:33.190 --> 07:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
energy and planning with the 250 000
 
07:14:36.310 --> 07:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
consulting budget that the 2018
 
07:14:38.948 --> 07:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
strategy and even now there there is not
 
07:14:41.270 --> 07:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
a specific you know budget for
 
07:14:44.150 --> 07:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh consultants attached to it and and
 
07:14:46.150 --> 07:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know is left to the expertise of the
 
07:14:46.160 --> 07:14:48.788 align:start position:0%
you know is left to the expertise of the
department

07:14:48.788 --> 07:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:51.110 --> 07:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh additional questions
 
07:14:51.120 --> 07:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh additional questions
for

07:14:52.310 --> 07:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:14:53.990 --> 07:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the department of
 
07:14:55.510 --> 07:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
energy we have other people who would
 
07:14:59.750 --> 07:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
like to testify representative christian
 
07:15:01.270 --> 07:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
07:15:01.280 --> 07:15:02.310 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

07:15:02.310 --> 07:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:15:05.510 --> 07:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
i had a question about the language
 
07:15:07.510 --> 07:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
on the first page
 
07:15:09.270 --> 07:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
the new text
 
07:15:11.510 --> 07:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
lines 14 through 16
 
07:15:12.868 --> 07:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
about the audit
 
07:15:15.990 --> 07:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
being conducted of the puc
 
07:15:17.830 --> 07:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
the part that reads which in the opinion
 
07:15:19.270 --> 07:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the commission or the department of
 
07:15:22.628 --> 07:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
energy ought to be audited is that
 
07:15:24.948 --> 07:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
meant to
 
07:15:27.030 --> 07:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
i guess define the scope of the audit
 
07:15:29.270 --> 07:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
saying that the department of energy is
 
07:15:31.350 --> 07:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
able to decide what needs to be audited
 
07:15:34.788 --> 07:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
or is that kind of editorializing
 
07:15:34.798 --> 07:15:36.948 align:start position:0%
or is that kind of editorializing
so

07:15:36.948 --> 07:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:15:38.468 --> 07:15:38.478 align:start position:0%
first of all the
 
07:15:38.478 --> 07:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
first of all the
commission

07:15:39.510 --> 07:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
07:15:42.150 --> 07:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
has had an auditing staff
 
07:15:45.030 --> 07:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
for as long as i can remember right
 
07:15:47.270 --> 07:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
and that auditing staff
 
07:15:47.280 --> 07:15:49.110 align:start position:0%
and that auditing staff
um

07:15:49.110 --> 07:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:52.788 --> 07:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
does certain things on a routine basis
 
07:15:55.590 --> 07:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
such as whenever a utility
 
07:15:55.600 --> 07:15:56.868 align:start position:0%
such as whenever a utility
applies

07:15:56.868 --> 07:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
applies
 
07:15:59.270 --> 07:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
for a full rate increase they file a
 
07:16:01.590 --> 07:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
full rate increase they base that
 
07:16:03.510 --> 07:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
increase on a test year
 
07:16:05.590 --> 07:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
and their expenses
 
07:16:08.230 --> 07:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
and expenditures during that test year
 
07:16:10.230 --> 07:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
are fully audited
 
07:16:14.548 --> 07:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
but by the audit division to make sure
 
07:16:14.558 --> 07:16:15.510 align:start position:0%
but by the audit division to make sure
that

07:16:15.510 --> 07:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:16:17.510 --> 07:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
the rates are based on a revenue
 
07:16:19.670 --> 07:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
requirement for the utility that there
 
07:16:21.830 --> 07:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a relationship to reality right and
 
07:16:23.990 --> 07:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
everything checks out right
 
07:16:27.190 --> 07:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
before the rates are made right
 
07:16:29.510 --> 07:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
they also do desk audits
 
07:16:32.948 --> 07:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
of utilities on small matters
 
07:16:32.958 --> 07:16:34.468 align:start position:0%
of utilities on small matters
they

07:16:34.468 --> 07:16:34.478 align:start position:0%
they
 
07:16:37.510 --> 07:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
audit some of the programs
 
07:16:40.548 --> 07:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
that that occur
 
07:16:44.150 --> 07:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:46.230 --> 07:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
and all of that staff has moved to the
 
07:16:46.240 --> 07:16:47.750 align:start position:0%
and all of that staff has moved to the
department

07:16:47.750 --> 07:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
07:16:49.830 --> 07:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
the commission no longer has any of that
 
07:16:49.840 --> 07:16:50.708 align:start position:0%
the commission no longer has any of that
staff

07:16:50.708 --> 07:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
staff
 
07:16:50.718 --> 07:16:51.510 align:start position:0%
staff
right

07:16:51.510 --> 07:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:16:51.520 --> 07:16:52.708 align:start position:0%
right
so

07:16:52.708 --> 07:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:16:54.708 --> 07:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
if the commission
 
07:16:54.718 --> 07:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
if the commission
wants

07:16:55.910 --> 07:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
wants
 
07:16:55.920 --> 07:16:56.868 align:start position:0%
wants
to

07:16:56.868 --> 07:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:16:58.310 --> 07:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
conduct an audit
 
07:17:00.468 --> 07:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
it has no one on its own staff to turn
 
07:17:00.478 --> 07:17:01.510 align:start position:0%
it has no one on its own staff to turn
to

07:17:01.510 --> 07:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:17:04.070 --> 07:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
but if as in the past it thinks that an
 
07:17:06.388 --> 07:17:06.398 align:start position:0%
audit ought to be done
 
07:17:08.230 --> 07:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know so that it can fill its
 
07:17:10.230 --> 07:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements whatever they
 
07:17:11.270 --> 07:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
might be
 
07:17:12.628 --> 07:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
they want to be able
 
07:17:14.230 --> 07:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
to have the department do that the
 
07:17:16.628 --> 07:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
department staff right do that because
 
07:17:18.548 --> 07:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
that's where they're located right now
 
07:17:20.548 --> 07:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
that's part of the purpose of this
 
07:17:22.150 --> 07:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
and then even if
 
07:17:24.310 --> 07:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have the staff
 
07:17:26.230 --> 07:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
the department has the ability to
 
07:17:26.240 --> 07:17:28.070 align:start position:0%
the department has the ability to
contract

07:17:28.070 --> 07:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
contract
 
07:17:30.628 --> 07:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
for outside auditors to do types of
 
07:17:32.310 --> 07:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
audits that the staff doesn't normally
 
07:17:34.868 --> 07:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
do say it's a management audit of the
 
07:17:37.110 --> 07:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
company and the commission really thinks
 
07:17:38.150 --> 07:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
that one
 
07:17:40.070 --> 07:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be done they can ask the
 
07:17:43.590 --> 07:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
department to do it and the department
 
07:17:45.670 --> 07:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
can go through the process of hiring
 
07:17:45.680 --> 07:17:46.468 align:start position:0%
can go through the process of hiring
those

07:17:46.468 --> 07:17:46.478 align:start position:0%
those
 
07:17:48.628 --> 07:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
those auditing companies to to do that
 
07:17:51.430 --> 07:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
work so i think that's that that's what
 
07:17:55.110 --> 07:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
this provision is is primarily about
 
07:17:55.120 --> 07:17:56.070 align:start position:0%
this provision is is primarily about
right

07:17:56.070 --> 07:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:17:57.750 --> 07:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you great
 
07:17:59.510 --> 07:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee did you
 
07:18:01.030 --> 07:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
have a question too
 
07:18:02.868 --> 07:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
i did and it was on another topic but
 
07:18:04.468 --> 07:18:04.478 align:start position:0%
i'd like to follow on with what
 
07:18:06.070 --> 07:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative creation just said and
 
07:18:07.190 --> 07:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
just ask
 
07:18:08.948 --> 07:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
since those resources used to be
 
07:18:10.230 --> 07:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
assigned to the public utilities
 
07:18:11.990 --> 07:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission was there a benefit to them
 
07:18:14.628 --> 07:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
having their own in-house people
 
07:18:17.590 --> 07:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
available to them to help with those
 
07:18:19.030 --> 07:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
would that work
 
07:18:20.548 --> 07:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
and those investigations i'm just
 
07:18:22.150 --> 07:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
curious about the
 
07:18:23.270 --> 07:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
07:18:23.280 --> 07:18:24.628 align:start position:0%
you know the
organizational

07:18:24.628 --> 07:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
organizational
 
07:18:26.310 --> 07:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
posturing well i think there's
 
07:18:28.468 --> 07:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
definitely a benefit to having
 
07:18:32.070 --> 07:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
somebody do that work some sort of
 
07:18:34.230 --> 07:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
independent objective
 
07:18:35.750 --> 07:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
agency or
 
07:18:38.310 --> 07:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
company to to do that work
 
07:18:40.468 --> 07:18:40.478 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it matters whether
 
07:18:43.190 --> 07:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's specifically the puc
 
07:18:44.868 --> 07:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
where that's housed or the department
 
07:18:46.628 --> 07:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
where's where that's housed i think
 
07:18:48.230 --> 07:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
what's clear and this goes to
 
07:18:50.070 --> 07:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
07:18:51.910 --> 07:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
questioning we don't need two audit
 
07:18:53.750 --> 07:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
departments and so we don't need to
 
07:18:54.948 --> 07:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
support that
 
07:18:54.958 --> 07:18:56.388 align:start position:0%
support that
so

07:18:56.388 --> 07:18:56.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:18:59.110 --> 07:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's housed at the department the
 
07:19:01.590 --> 07:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
department's auditors can do that work
 
07:19:04.310 --> 07:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
this provision allows the public
 
07:19:06.230 --> 07:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
07:19:08.948 --> 07:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
to to task them with that work okay
 
07:19:11.510 --> 07:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and can i ask my question
 
07:19:13.510 --> 07:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's on you yes follow up thank you it's
 
07:19:15.670 --> 07:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's on uh on this page again there's a
 
07:19:15.680 --> 07:19:16.708 align:start position:0%
it's on uh on this page again there's a
reference

07:19:16.708 --> 07:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
reference
 
07:19:18.868 --> 07:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
to provisions that would
 
07:19:20.548 --> 07:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
be um
 
07:19:22.230 --> 07:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
that that the department would not be
 
07:19:25.830 --> 07:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
subject to and it refers to rsa 541
 
07:19:29.070 --> 07:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
a29 or rsa
 
07:19:32.868 --> 07:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
541a29a and can you just give us a quick
 
07:19:34.948 --> 07:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
idea of what that is that we'd be
 
07:19:39.590 --> 07:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
exempting if we adopted these so 541 8
 
07:19:39.600 --> 07:19:43.430 align:start position:0%
exempting if we adopted these so 541 8
29

07:19:43.430 --> 07:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:43.440 --> 07:19:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
requires

07:19:45.030 --> 07:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
requires
 
07:19:47.590 --> 07:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
an agency when it gets any type of
 
07:19:50.070 --> 07:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
request or application
 
07:19:52.628 --> 07:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
from some someone in the public
 
07:19:52.638 --> 07:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
from some someone in the public
to

07:19:53.350 --> 07:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:19:53.360 --> 07:19:54.708 align:start position:0%
to
respond

07:19:54.708 --> 07:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
respond
 
07:19:57.830 --> 07:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um it used to be within 60 days and
 
07:20:00.708 --> 07:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
until that now it's 30 under the statute
 
07:20:03.990 --> 07:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
um to tell that person well this is
 
07:20:05.750 --> 07:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
what's missing from your application or
 
07:20:07.590 --> 07:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that i have with your
 
07:20:11.590 --> 07:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:13.430 --> 07:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
and to ask any questions that needed to
 
07:20:14.868 --> 07:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
be asked
 
07:20:18.070 --> 07:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then it required action within 60
 
07:20:18.080 --> 07:20:19.270 align:start position:0%
and then it required action within 60
days

07:20:19.270 --> 07:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
days
 
07:20:21.590 --> 07:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
or the opening of an adjudicative
 
07:20:21.600 --> 07:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
or the opening of an adjudicative
proceeding

07:20:23.510 --> 07:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
07:20:26.070 --> 07:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
for which not all applicant applications
 
07:20:26.080 --> 07:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
for which not all applicant applications
are

07:20:27.590 --> 07:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:20:29.510 --> 07:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
suitable for right
 
07:20:32.230 --> 07:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
and if that didn't happen
 
07:20:33.670 --> 07:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
then house bill
 
07:20:36.548 --> 07:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry it was house bill 1104 with
 
07:20:38.628 --> 07:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
his where this happened a number of
 
07:20:39.750 --> 07:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
07:20:41.270 --> 07:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
but um
 
07:20:41.280 --> 07:20:42.788 align:start position:0%
but um
29a

07:20:42.788 --> 07:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
29a
 
07:20:46.070 --> 07:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
says that if if an agency doesn't meet
 
07:20:48.468 --> 07:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
those deadlines then the approval is
 
07:20:51.190 --> 07:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
automatically granted as a matter of law
 
07:20:52.708 --> 07:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
07:20:54.468 --> 07:20:54.478 align:start position:0%
for some agencies for the things that
 
07:20:55.430 --> 07:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
they do
 
07:20:57.750 --> 07:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
that type of automatic approval in those
 
07:21:00.548 --> 07:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
timelines are either very tight or
 
07:21:03.430 --> 07:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
impossible or the types of approvals
 
07:21:05.430 --> 07:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
that they give really
 
07:21:07.510 --> 07:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
really aren't suitable for that sort of
 
07:21:07.520 --> 07:21:08.868 align:start position:0%
really aren't suitable for that sort of
automatic

07:21:08.868 --> 07:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
automatic
 
07:21:08.878 --> 07:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
automatic
uh

07:21:10.310 --> 07:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:21:12.468 --> 07:21:12.478 align:start position:0%
operation of law
 
07:21:12.478 --> 07:21:13.670 align:start position:0%
operation of law
provision

07:21:13.670 --> 07:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
provision
 
07:21:16.948 --> 07:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
so when house bill 1104 went through the
 
07:21:19.190 --> 07:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
legislature a number of agencies were
 
07:21:22.708 --> 07:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
granted exemptions to those requirements
 
07:21:26.230 --> 07:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the public utility commission
 
07:21:28.468 --> 07:21:28.478 align:start position:0%
probably got the biggest exemptions of
 
07:21:31.910 --> 07:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right because very few of the things
 
07:21:34.150 --> 07:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
that come before
 
07:21:35.670 --> 07:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission are now
 
07:21:37.590 --> 07:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
the department are things that are
 
07:21:40.788 --> 07:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
resolvable within that period of time
 
07:21:40.798 --> 07:21:42.548 align:start position:0%
resolvable within that period of time
right

07:21:42.548 --> 07:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:21:42.558 --> 07:21:43.750 align:start position:0%
right
and

07:21:43.750 --> 07:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:21:45.270 --> 07:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
for some of those
 
07:21:48.150 --> 07:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
those those approvals the results the
 
07:21:50.628 --> 07:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
consequences of an automatic approval
 
07:21:51.590 --> 07:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
can be
 
07:21:51.600 --> 07:21:53.830 align:start position:0%
can be
very

07:21:53.830 --> 07:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
very
 
07:21:56.070 --> 07:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
very dramatic right so
 
07:21:57.670 --> 07:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know for instance one of the things
 
07:21:59.190 --> 07:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:22:01.430 --> 07:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission does is it
 
07:22:04.468 --> 07:22:04.478 align:start position:0%
approves whether a utility
 
07:22:07.990 --> 07:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
can disconnect or terminate the service
 
07:22:09.910 --> 07:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
of a customer
 
07:22:13.190 --> 07:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
who has a medical need for the utility
 
07:22:14.708 --> 07:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
service so say somebody's on a
 
07:22:16.150 --> 07:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
respirator at home and they need
 
07:22:18.628 --> 07:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
electricity they might have a medical
 
07:22:20.628 --> 07:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
exemption filed with the public
 
07:22:22.788 --> 07:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
utilities commission the utility might
 
07:22:24.708 --> 07:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
come in and say well you know they
 
07:22:26.708 --> 07:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
haven't paid their bill in five years i
 
07:22:29.590 --> 07:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
really want to turn off the electricity
 
07:22:29.600 --> 07:22:31.110 align:start position:0%
really want to turn off the electricity
and

07:22:31.110 --> 07:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:22:34.230 --> 07:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
the role that the state has in that is
 
07:22:36.948 --> 07:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that enough leg work
 
07:22:39.190 --> 07:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
has been done
 
07:22:41.670 --> 07:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
to assure that the proper notifications
 
07:22:43.510 --> 07:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
have been made and and somebody with
 
07:22:45.830 --> 07:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
that type of condition isn't going to
 
07:22:45.840 --> 07:22:46.948 align:start position:0%
that type of condition isn't going to
abruptly

07:22:46.948 --> 07:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
abruptly
 
07:22:48.468 --> 07:22:48.478 align:start position:0%
lose their electricity lose their
 
07:22:50.070 --> 07:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
respirator and die in the middle of the
 
07:22:52.310 --> 07:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
night right and this stems from an
 
07:22:52.320 --> 07:22:53.270 align:start position:0%
night right and this stems from an
actual

07:22:53.270 --> 07:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
actual
 
07:22:55.270 --> 07:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
occurrence right it was a piece of
 
07:22:57.430 --> 07:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislation to solve an actual problem
 
07:22:57.440 --> 07:22:58.388 align:start position:0%
legislation to solve an actual problem
right

07:22:58.388 --> 07:22:58.398 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:23:00.070 --> 07:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:23:01.750 --> 07:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
so you know those those sorts of things
 
07:23:04.548 --> 07:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
are not resolvable within the short time
 
07:23:06.548 --> 07:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
period because of the leg work that's
 
07:23:06.558 --> 07:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
period because of the leg work that's
required

07:23:07.750 --> 07:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
required
 
07:23:09.350 --> 07:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the period
 
07:23:12.548 --> 07:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
the notification periods etc
 
07:23:13.590 --> 07:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
07:23:15.430 --> 07:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
not everything at the commission was
 
07:23:17.270 --> 07:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
that dramatic but
 
07:23:17.280 --> 07:23:19.510 align:start position:0%
that dramatic but
everything

07:23:19.510 --> 07:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
everything
 
07:23:21.590 --> 07:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
has enough procedure to it that it takes
 
07:23:24.548 --> 07:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
a long time to to get to a yes or no
 
07:23:24.558 --> 07:23:26.388 align:start position:0%
a long time to to get to a yes or no
okay

07:23:26.388 --> 07:23:26.398 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:23:26.398 --> 07:23:27.670 align:start position:0%
okay
so

07:23:27.670 --> 07:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:23:31.510 --> 07:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
when house bill 2 went through
 
07:23:33.110 --> 07:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of that work came over to the
 
07:23:35.750 --> 07:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
department but there were
 
07:23:37.510 --> 07:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
there was an oversight in
 
07:23:39.990 --> 07:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the exemptions the exemptions didn't
 
07:23:41.670 --> 07:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
follow so
 
07:23:43.190 --> 07:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:23:45.270 --> 07:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
now we have all those problems at the at
 
07:23:48.628 --> 07:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
the department right and um if you are
 
07:23:50.788 --> 07:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
kind enough to actually transfer the
 
07:23:53.910 --> 07:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
authority for 363 b over to the
 
07:23:55.750 --> 07:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
department that's the authority for
 
07:23:58.548 --> 07:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
approving medical disconnects right
 
07:24:00.388 --> 07:24:00.398 align:start position:0%
we will we will have that problem i mean
 
07:24:02.388 --> 07:24:02.398 align:start position:0%
currently the commission
 
07:24:03.910 --> 07:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
because the exemption didn't move and
 
07:24:05.590 --> 07:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the statute didn't move the commission's
 
07:24:07.510 --> 07:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
not subject to five
 
07:24:10.548 --> 07:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh to 29a but if it comes over and we
 
07:24:12.788 --> 07:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
don't get this type of exemption
 
07:24:14.548 --> 07:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
we'll be subject to that
 
07:24:17.190 --> 07:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
that time period thank you i've heard of
 
07:24:19.110 --> 07:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
this before i just wasn't sure in
 
07:24:20.788 --> 07:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
looking to the reference i didn't i
 
07:24:22.070 --> 07:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know what we were talking about
 
07:24:24.310 --> 07:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
but that's sufficient for me
 
07:24:26.150 --> 07:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all right
 
07:24:28.150 --> 07:24:28.160 align:start position:0%

representative harrington for bringing
 
07:25:00.948 --> 07:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
this bill forward and say i'm generally
 
07:25:03.350 --> 07:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
supportive of the idea of trying to
 
07:25:05.030 --> 07:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
straighten these things out and i would
 
07:25:06.788 --> 07:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
hope that folks could try to work on a
 
07:25:09.190 --> 07:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis there are some policy
 
07:25:11.510 --> 07:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions i'm not
 
07:25:13.190 --> 07:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
sure one way or the other on a few of
 
07:25:14.948 --> 07:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
them myself but you'll have to make
 
07:25:17.030 --> 07:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
those decisions i'm mainly here to
 
07:25:20.150 --> 07:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
address uh one particular issue um
 
07:25:22.628 --> 07:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
that's not mentioned from the doe on the
 
07:25:24.948 --> 07:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
very last page of the bill
 
07:25:27.110 --> 07:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
under um section 20 there's three
 
07:25:27.120 --> 07:25:28.868 align:start position:0%
under um section 20 there's three
repeals

07:25:28.868 --> 07:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
07:25:32.230 --> 07:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
at line six there's a repeal of rsa 374
 
07:25:32.240 --> 07:25:32.948 align:start position:0%
at line six there's a repeal of rsa 374
f

07:25:32.948 --> 07:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
f
 
07:25:34.628 --> 07:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
three roman four
 
07:25:36.548 --> 07:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the restructuring
 
07:25:39.110 --> 07:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
policy principles that was enacted by
 
07:25:41.990 --> 07:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
this body 26 years ago and just in that
 
07:25:42.000 --> 07:25:44.788 align:start position:0%
this body 26 years ago and just in that
context

07:25:44.788 --> 07:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:47.750 --> 07:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
back 26 years ago in 1996 there was a
 
07:25:50.628 --> 07:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
major federal policy effort going on
 
07:25:52.388 --> 07:25:52.398 align:start position:0%
with the federal energy regulatory
 
07:25:52.398 --> 07:25:53.430 align:start position:0%
with the federal energy regulatory
commission

07:25:53.430 --> 07:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
07:25:55.990 --> 07:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
to open up non-discriminatory access to
 
07:25:58.388 --> 07:25:58.398 align:start position:0%
the transmission grid to promote uh
 
07:26:00.788 --> 07:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
competition in the interstate wholesale
 
07:26:03.750 --> 07:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
markets and
 
07:26:06.310 --> 07:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
that order actually came out just a
 
07:26:08.388 --> 07:26:08.398 align:start position:0%
month after the new hampshire house
 
07:26:11.110 --> 07:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
passed similar language into law and and
 
07:26:13.510 --> 07:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
what this would repeal um
 
07:26:13.520 --> 07:26:14.468 align:start position:0%
what this would repeal um
is

07:26:14.468 --> 07:26:14.478 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:26:15.990 --> 07:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
one of the restructuring policy
 
07:26:17.670 --> 07:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
principles which were enacted rather
 
07:26:19.350 --> 07:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
than trying to be real prescriptive
 
07:26:21.270 --> 07:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
about how we uh restructured the
 
07:26:23.830 --> 07:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
industry we said set forth a set of
 
07:26:27.270 --> 07:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
principles to guide the puc too loud or
 
07:26:29.110 --> 07:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
stupid can't keep up with you way too
 
07:26:32.788 --> 07:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
fast okay okay sorry i'll slow down
 
07:26:34.548 --> 07:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
um so
 
07:26:36.788 --> 07:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
the fourth restructuring policy
 
07:26:39.190 --> 07:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
principle um
 
07:26:41.910 --> 07:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
and it is real simple it says open
 
07:26:44.310 --> 07:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
access to transmission and distribution
 
07:26:46.830 --> 07:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
facilities that's the title and it says
 
07:26:49.030 --> 07:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory open access to the
 
07:26:51.430 --> 07:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
electric system for wholesale and
 
07:26:53.910 --> 07:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
retrail retail transactions should be
 
07:26:53.920 --> 07:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
retrail retail transactions should be
promoted

07:26:55.030 --> 07:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
promoted
 
07:26:57.430 --> 07:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's the important principle and and
 
07:26:59.270 --> 07:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's three more sentences that follow
 
07:27:01.030 --> 07:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
which are kind of out of date and i'm
 
07:27:03.430 --> 07:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
guessing uh that somebody looking at the
 
07:27:05.430 --> 07:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
rest of that said oh this stuff doesn't
 
07:27:07.670 --> 07:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
really make sense anymore so repeal the
 
07:27:08.708 --> 07:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
07:27:10.948 --> 07:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
so my ask would be don't repeal the
 
07:27:12.948 --> 07:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
whole thing keep at least that first
 
07:27:15.910 --> 07:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
sentence which is sort of foundational
 
07:27:18.388 --> 07:27:18.398 align:start position:0%
to the idea of competition and customer
 
07:27:21.030 --> 07:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
choice and when
 
07:27:23.030 --> 07:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
in statutory interpretation when
 
07:27:25.110 --> 07:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
something's repealed it's taken to have
 
07:27:30.388 --> 07:27:30.398 align:start position:0%
some meaning and impact and i i
 
07:27:31.830 --> 07:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
federal law controls open
 
07:27:33.510 --> 07:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory access to
 
07:27:35.830 --> 07:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
transmission but i think we want to have
 
07:27:38.070 --> 07:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
that same principle or else you're
 
07:27:39.750 --> 07:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that maybe we should
 
07:27:41.350 --> 07:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
repeal the whole statute and get rid of
 
07:27:43.510 --> 07:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
customer choice and competition that
 
07:27:45.430 --> 07:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's the main thing i did want to
 
07:27:46.708 --> 07:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
comment on a couple things that have
 
07:27:49.110 --> 07:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
just come up today real quickly excuse
 
07:27:51.030 --> 07:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
me could you before we leave this
 
07:27:53.750 --> 07:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
subject could you tell us
 
07:27:55.590 --> 07:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about
 
07:27:56.708 --> 07:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
what that
 
07:27:56.718 --> 07:27:58.628 align:start position:0%
what that
access

07:27:58.628 --> 07:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
access
 
07:28:00.150 --> 07:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
07:28:01.750 --> 07:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
well what what it really means an
 
07:28:05.510 --> 07:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
example yeah um it means that if uh
 
07:28:09.830 --> 07:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
um a business like this or institutions
 
07:28:11.270 --> 07:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire or any
 
07:28:13.830 --> 07:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
business uh wanted to choose their
 
07:28:15.990 --> 07:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
supplier rather than the utility default
 
07:28:17.350 --> 07:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
service they wanted to go with a
 
07:28:19.990 --> 07:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
different competitive electric supplier
 
07:28:22.468 --> 07:28:22.478 align:start position:0%
it means that they could choose the
 
07:28:24.708 --> 07:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
competitive electric supplier and the
 
07:28:27.190 --> 07:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
power could access
 
07:28:28.788 --> 07:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
onto the grid
 
07:28:31.350 --> 07:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
and um to the customer
 
07:28:31.360 --> 07:28:32.150 align:start position:0%
and um to the customer
and

07:28:32.150 --> 07:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:28:34.788 --> 07:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
the if the utility for instance owned
 
07:28:36.548 --> 07:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
generation they wouldn't have an
 
07:28:39.270 --> 07:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
advantage in the terms
 
07:28:42.468 --> 07:28:42.478 align:start position:0%
or access to the grid for
 
07:28:44.708 --> 07:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh customers getting their electricity
 
07:28:44.718 --> 07:28:46.548 align:start position:0%
uh customers getting their electricity
supply

07:28:46.548 --> 07:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
supply
 
07:28:48.628 --> 07:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
the the it used to be
 
07:28:50.548 --> 07:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
uh before restructuring both at the
 
07:28:53.190 --> 07:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
federal and state level that if utility
 
07:28:53.200 --> 07:28:54.150 align:start position:0%
federal and state level that if utility
owned

07:28:54.150 --> 07:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
owned
 
07:28:56.628 --> 07:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
just transmission or distribution they
 
07:28:59.190 --> 07:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
could say you cannot sell power over our
 
07:29:01.270 --> 07:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
our system um
 
07:29:03.110 --> 07:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
and and they would block they would
 
07:29:05.270 --> 07:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
discriminate they would make deals with
 
07:29:08.310 --> 07:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
some uh suppliers and some off takers
 
07:29:11.430 --> 07:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
but not others and so that's why
 
07:29:11.440 --> 07:29:12.628 align:start position:0%
but not others and so that's why
congress

07:29:12.628 --> 07:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
congress
 
07:29:14.788 --> 07:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh directed ferc
 
07:29:18.070 --> 07:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh to um move in this direction and this
 
07:29:21.670 --> 07:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
has really been broadly um embraced by
 
07:29:23.750 --> 07:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
the industry as a better approach than a
 
07:29:25.990 --> 07:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
heavy regulatory approach to these
 
07:29:26.000 --> 07:29:27.270 align:start position:0%
heavy regulatory approach to these
questions

07:29:27.270 --> 07:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:29:29.990 --> 07:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
just open non-discriminatory
 
07:29:32.548 --> 07:29:32.558 align:start position:0%
access for these retail and wholesale
 
07:29:32.558 --> 07:29:33.990 align:start position:0%
access for these retail and wholesale
transactions

07:29:33.990 --> 07:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
07:29:36.868 --> 07:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
is it still an issue in the absence of
 
07:29:39.270 --> 07:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
utility owned generation
 
07:29:39.280 --> 07:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
utility owned generation
um

07:29:41.510 --> 07:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:43.350 --> 07:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
this is what is essentially the
 
07:29:45.510 --> 07:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
condition today but the question would
 
07:29:47.830 --> 07:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
be if you're repealing that does that
 
07:29:49.830 --> 07:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
mean that doesn't that's not important
 
07:29:51.430 --> 07:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
anymore um
 
07:29:54.468 --> 07:29:54.478 align:start position:0%
it's just i i i wouldn't see why you'd
 
07:29:56.468 --> 07:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
want to repeal that principle because
 
07:29:59.750 --> 07:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's sort of foundational uh to how
 
07:30:01.990 --> 07:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
we work in new hampshire and most of new
 
07:30:05.110 --> 07:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
england it's not not true in vermont
 
07:30:07.590 --> 07:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
you can't choose a different supplier of
 
07:30:10.628 --> 07:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
your power than the vertically or or the
 
07:30:13.190 --> 07:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
one monopoly utility there's no customer
 
07:30:15.670 --> 07:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
choice um so that that that's sort of
 
07:30:18.388 --> 07:30:18.398 align:start position:0%
where it's connected to
 
07:30:21.430 --> 07:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay the other uh two things i just want
 
07:30:22.948 --> 07:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
to mention i i don't really take a
 
07:30:25.270 --> 07:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
position at this point because i it's
 
07:30:27.190 --> 07:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
the first i've heard of it of who's
 
07:30:29.830 --> 07:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
going to review electric aggregations
 
07:30:32.788 --> 07:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
plans for community power aggregation um
 
07:30:34.548 --> 07:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
07:30:36.868 --> 07:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
that it's not really a regulatory
 
07:30:39.270 --> 07:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
function the review is for conformity
 
07:30:42.070 --> 07:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
with applicable statutes and rules
 
07:30:42.080 --> 07:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
with applicable statutes and rules
um

07:30:43.110 --> 07:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:30:45.190 --> 07:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
and it does seem like a
 
07:30:46.788 --> 07:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
just at first plus it seems like the
 
07:30:49.190 --> 07:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
pucs appropriate for that because their
 
07:30:51.350 --> 07:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
their main job is to see
 
07:30:53.510 --> 07:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
how does the law apply how do the rules
 
07:30:53.520 --> 07:30:54.468 align:start position:0%
how does the law apply how do the rules
apply

07:30:54.468 --> 07:30:54.478 align:start position:0%
apply
 
07:30:57.430 --> 07:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
um are people meeting them that you know
 
07:30:59.830 --> 07:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're just sort of a neutral uh body
 
07:31:02.230 --> 07:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
for that but but i'm happy i'm happy to
 
07:31:03.830 --> 07:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
work with the department and the
 
07:31:05.990 --> 07:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if that's of any help to to
 
07:31:07.670 --> 07:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
think this through because i don't have
 
07:31:10.150 --> 07:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
a firm position on that um
 
07:31:12.150 --> 07:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
the other issue i just wanted to mention
 
07:31:14.388 --> 07:31:14.398 align:start position:0%
is poll attachments there's just one
 
07:31:16.150 --> 07:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
little part of this bill that touches on
 
07:31:16.160 --> 07:31:17.030 align:start position:0%
little part of this bill that touches on
that

07:31:17.030 --> 07:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:31:19.350 --> 07:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
but looking that at that more
 
07:31:19.360 --> 07:31:20.628 align:start position:0%
but looking that at that more
generally

07:31:20.628 --> 07:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
generally
 
07:31:22.310 --> 07:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
i think there's some
 
07:31:24.628 --> 07:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
there's some issues that bear further
 
07:31:26.468 --> 07:31:26.478 align:start position:0%
thought in the subcommittee and i'll
 
07:31:32.230 --> 07:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:33.270 --> 07:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
back in
 
07:31:36.948 --> 07:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
before 2007 the state did not have the
 
07:31:39.350 --> 07:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate poll attachments
 
07:31:41.750 --> 07:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
congress gave that authority to the
 
07:31:44.150 --> 07:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
federal communications commission to
 
07:31:46.750 --> 07:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
promote and actually use the term open
 
07:31:50.150 --> 07:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory access to polls for
 
07:31:52.310 --> 07:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
competition cable companies and
 
07:31:54.708 --> 07:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
competitive telecom providers which have
 
07:31:57.030 --> 07:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
obviously produced enormous benefits for
 
07:31:59.350 --> 07:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
econom our economy to have that
 
07:31:59.360 --> 07:32:00.708 align:start position:0%
econom our economy to have that
competition

07:32:00.708 --> 07:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
competition
 
07:32:03.830 --> 07:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
um it was a big issue i i was on the on
 
07:32:06.310 --> 07:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
the commission at that time cliff excuse
 
07:32:08.230 --> 07:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
me are you referring to
 
07:32:11.110 --> 07:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh section 15 of the bill as introduced
 
07:32:14.948 --> 07:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you thank you um
 
07:32:16.230 --> 07:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:32:18.788 --> 07:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
we had a backlog of complaints from
 
07:32:21.110 --> 07:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
telecom providers wanting to attach to
 
07:32:21.120 --> 07:32:22.468 align:start position:0%
telecom providers wanting to attach to
polls

07:32:22.468 --> 07:32:22.478 align:start position:0%
polls
 
07:32:26.388 --> 07:32:26.398 align:start position:0%
frustrated with the incumbent utilities
 
07:32:28.388 --> 07:32:28.398 align:start position:0%
and their only recourse was to file a
 
07:32:30.310 --> 07:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
complaint with the fcc which would just
 
07:32:32.150 --> 07:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
sit around for years
 
07:32:34.070 --> 07:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
and and so um
 
07:32:37.430 --> 07:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
they asked if we couldn't take on that
 
07:32:39.830 --> 07:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
job and there's a specific federal
 
07:32:42.468 --> 07:32:42.478 align:start position:0%
statute that's referred to here
 
07:32:45.030 --> 07:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
that said okay states are preempted from
 
07:32:45.040 --> 07:32:45.910 align:start position:0%
that said okay states are preempted from
this

07:32:45.910 --> 07:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:32:49.350 --> 07:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
but if you meet all these criteria
 
07:32:51.350 --> 07:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
and you certify that you
 
07:32:54.468 --> 07:32:54.478 align:start position:0%
do this then the states can do this for
 
07:32:56.628 --> 07:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
in lieu of the fcc is sort of a
 
07:32:59.030 --> 07:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
delegation of federal authority and and
 
07:33:01.110 --> 07:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
the one little sentence in here is just
 
07:33:03.430 --> 07:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
part of what was added as part of house
 
07:33:04.708 --> 07:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
bill two
 
07:33:07.910 --> 07:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
and it you know the bill says you know
 
07:33:09.590 --> 07:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
back to the commission the department
 
07:33:11.190 --> 07:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
said well maybe that really should say
 
07:33:11.200 --> 07:33:12.548 align:start position:0%
said well maybe that really should say
doe

07:33:12.548 --> 07:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
doe
 
07:33:14.230 --> 07:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
when i'm looking at the whole statute
 
07:33:15.990 --> 07:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
which i won't go into
 
07:33:17.830 --> 07:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
i think there's some things to sort out
 
07:33:19.670 --> 07:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
because there was an effort to sort of
 
07:33:21.750 --> 07:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
split the roles and say well the
 
07:33:21.760 --> 07:33:23.830 align:start position:0%
split the roles and say well the
commission

07:33:23.830 --> 07:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
07:33:26.150 --> 07:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the underlying statute as it now
 
07:33:30.388 --> 07:33:30.398 align:start position:0%
reads the commission can settle disputes
 
07:33:32.388 --> 07:33:32.398 align:start position:0%
and regulate and enforce rates and
 
07:33:35.510 --> 07:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
charges but it's the department of
 
07:33:39.430 --> 07:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
energy that in carrying it out its role
 
07:33:42.468 --> 07:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
in this is the one that considers the
 
07:33:44.948 --> 07:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
interests of subscribers and users of
 
07:33:47.030 --> 07:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
the services offered via such
 
07:33:49.350 --> 07:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
attachments as well as the interest of
 
07:33:51.270 --> 07:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
consumers of any poll owner providing
 
07:33:53.910 --> 07:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
such attachments that's a balancing test
 
07:33:56.310 --> 07:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
a regulatory balancing test
 
07:33:56.320 --> 07:33:57.270 align:start position:0%
a regulatory balancing test
and

07:33:57.270 --> 07:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:34:00.230 --> 07:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
the underlying statute actually
 
07:34:03.350 --> 07:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much indicates that regulatory
 
07:34:05.670 --> 07:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
that responsibility to do a balancing
 
07:34:08.230 --> 07:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
test between different interests
 
07:34:10.070 --> 07:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
needs to go with the authority to
 
07:34:12.788 --> 07:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
regulate the rates and the way
 
07:34:15.190 --> 07:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
the statute is at the moment the
 
07:34:17.310 --> 07:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
commission does not have the that
 
07:34:19.990 --> 07:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do that balancing test
 
07:34:21.110 --> 07:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
although that's kind of what they
 
07:34:23.350 --> 07:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
traditionally do that's been moved over
 
07:34:25.510 --> 07:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
to doe and
 
07:34:27.990 --> 07:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say we're not in
 
07:34:30.548 --> 07:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
conformity with the federal statute but
 
07:34:30.558 --> 07:34:31.590 align:start position:0%
conformity with the federal statute but
but

07:34:31.590 --> 07:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:34:33.110 --> 07:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
there might be an issue here that could
 
07:34:35.350 --> 07:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
be cleaned up along the way and that
 
07:34:37.430 --> 07:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's all i'm saying and and i
 
07:34:39.830 --> 07:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
just i i'm familiar with this because at
 
07:34:41.430 --> 07:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
the time i was sort of the commission's
 
07:34:44.788 --> 07:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
point person and helped write this rsa
 
07:34:47.270 --> 07:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
374 34a
 
07:34:49.990 --> 07:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
and worked with our own attorneys the
 
07:34:52.150 --> 07:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
department of justice and the fcc to
 
07:34:54.548 --> 07:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're compliant
 
07:34:57.190 --> 07:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
with what allowed us to take over this
 
07:34:59.750 --> 07:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
authority and um
 
07:35:01.190 --> 07:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
and and then i also worked on the
 
07:35:03.030 --> 07:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
initial poll attachment rules quite a
 
07:35:05.990 --> 07:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
bit um so i
 
07:35:07.990 --> 07:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's just something that you know
 
07:35:09.990 --> 07:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has asked me
 
07:35:11.750 --> 07:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know somebody who's a former
 
07:35:13.030 --> 07:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner has worked with the stuff
 
07:35:14.628 --> 07:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
to you know if i might be another set of
 
07:35:16.468 --> 07:35:16.478 align:start position:0%
eyes on this and think about this so
 
07:35:18.230 --> 07:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
that that's just one little area that i
 
07:35:19.750 --> 07:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
thought i could contribute a little
 
07:35:21.110 --> 07:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
insight on
 
07:35:23.990 --> 07:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you questions for
 
07:35:30.230 --> 07:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:32.230 --> 07:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
07:35:34.070 --> 07:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you mr bilo nice to
 
07:35:35.030 --> 07:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
see you again
 
07:35:38.070 --> 07:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
um okay so what you were just explaining
 
07:35:39.590 --> 07:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
i was taking some notes on the poll
 
07:35:42.868 --> 07:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
attachment authority coming from the fcc
 
07:35:42.878 --> 07:35:44.548 align:start position:0%
attachment authority coming from the fcc
so

07:35:44.548 --> 07:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:35:46.230 --> 07:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the way that you described it it
 
07:35:47.830 --> 07:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like what you were saying is when
 
07:35:50.070 --> 07:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
you split that authority
 
07:35:52.548 --> 07:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
you are further diluting what the fcc
 
07:35:54.628 --> 07:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
intended when they said that they would
 
07:35:56.230 --> 07:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
provide that authority down to the
 
07:35:58.468 --> 07:35:58.478 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission level
 
07:36:02.310 --> 07:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:04.230 --> 07:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
less clear whether or not
 
07:36:05.990 --> 07:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
another agency would be able to take
 
07:36:07.910 --> 07:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
that authority is that correct that's
 
07:36:09.670 --> 07:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
what i thought i heard you say right so
 
07:36:13.388 --> 07:36:13.398 align:start position:0%
i'll just be specific one thing this
 
07:36:16.388 --> 07:36:16.398 align:start position:0%
47 usc
 
07:36:16.398 --> 07:36:17.910 align:start position:0%
47 usc
um

07:36:17.910 --> 07:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:36:19.430 --> 07:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing the whole number but it's
 
07:36:21.910 --> 07:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
referenced in the underlying statute you
 
07:36:23.590 --> 07:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
don't see it but it's in
 
07:36:23.600 --> 07:36:25.510 align:start position:0%
don't see it but it's in
374

07:36:25.510 --> 07:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
374
 
07:36:25.520 --> 07:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
374
34a

07:36:27.590 --> 07:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
34a
 
07:36:32.468 --> 07:36:32.478 align:start position:0%
it's 47 usc section 224c
 
07:36:36.070 --> 07:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
and one part of what that says is that
 
07:36:37.430 --> 07:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
each state
 
07:36:39.830 --> 07:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
which regulates terms and conditions for
 
07:36:42.310 --> 07:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
poll attachments shall certify to the
 
07:36:43.910 --> 07:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
commission meaning the federal
 
07:36:46.388 --> 07:36:46.398 align:start position:0%
communication commission that
 
07:36:46.398 --> 07:36:47.190 align:start position:0%
communication commission that
a

07:36:47.190 --> 07:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:36:49.430 --> 07:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
it regulates such terms
 
07:36:52.628 --> 07:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
rates terms and conditions and to be in
 
07:36:54.788 --> 07:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
so regulating such rates terms and
 
07:36:57.750 --> 07:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
conditions the state has the authority
 
07:37:00.388 --> 07:37:00.398 align:start position:0%
to consider and does consider
 
07:37:02.788 --> 07:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
the interests of the subscribers of the
 
07:37:04.868 --> 07:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
services offered by such attachments
 
07:37:08.150 --> 07:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
meaning basically cable and telecom
 
07:37:09.590 --> 07:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
people who are getting service from
 
07:37:11.910 --> 07:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
cable and telecom
 
07:37:14.150 --> 07:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
as well as the interest of the consumers
 
07:37:16.628 --> 07:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
of the utility services meaning
 
07:37:19.270 --> 07:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
the customers of the electric utility
 
07:37:20.948 --> 07:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
and the incumbent
 
07:37:24.788 --> 07:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
um you know wires uh telecom company
 
07:37:26.708 --> 07:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
and and and so it's a it's a little
 
07:37:28.468 --> 07:37:28.478 align:start position:0%
unusual balancing test but it's two
 
07:37:30.310 --> 07:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
different consumer groups that have an
 
07:37:32.548 --> 07:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
interest in terms and conditions and
 
07:37:35.590 --> 07:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
rates for poll attachments
 
07:37:39.750 --> 07:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
and what the split up of the two uh did
 
07:37:41.350 --> 07:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
is it says
 
07:37:43.350 --> 07:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay the commission still has some
 
07:37:46.070 --> 07:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
ra regulates rates terms and conditions
 
07:37:48.310 --> 07:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
but it's the doe
 
07:37:50.150 --> 07:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
under it's because the rules were moved
 
07:37:52.868 --> 07:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
to doe that has this balancing
 
07:37:52.878 --> 07:37:54.388 align:start position:0%
to doe that has this balancing
responsibility

07:37:54.388 --> 07:37:54.398 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
07:37:56.868 --> 07:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
and i think the federal statute says in
 
07:38:00.548 --> 07:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
so regulating the state
 
07:38:03.590 --> 07:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
will consider these factors and and the
 
07:38:05.990 --> 07:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
statute as it reads now doesn't direct
 
07:38:09.430 --> 07:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
the commission to do this balancing test
 
07:38:11.430 --> 07:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's in the department of energy when in
 
07:38:11.440 --> 07:38:12.548 align:start position:0%
it's in the department of energy when in
fact

07:38:12.548 --> 07:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
fact
 
07:38:12.558 --> 07:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
fact
it's

07:38:13.910 --> 07:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:38:16.230 --> 07:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
the regulation of some of this is still
 
07:38:18.230 --> 07:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the the
 
07:38:18.240 --> 07:38:19.430 align:start position:0%
with the the
commission

07:38:19.430 --> 07:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
07:38:21.110 --> 07:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that's a little bit confusing about
 
07:38:23.910 --> 07:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill because it it refers
 
07:38:23.920 --> 07:38:26.070 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill because it it refers
to

07:38:26.070 --> 07:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:38:29.110 --> 07:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
the puc retaining authority to regulate
 
07:38:31.430 --> 07:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
a bunch of things
 
07:38:33.990 --> 07:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
but includes poll attachments
 
07:38:35.990 --> 07:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and often the reference to conduits
 
07:38:39.110 --> 07:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
ducts pipes all that is also in the
 
07:38:40.788 --> 07:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
federal regulations it's sort of all
 
07:38:43.030 --> 07:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
under the poll attachment rubric
 
07:38:43.040 --> 07:38:43.830 align:start position:0%
under the poll attachment rubric
um

07:38:43.830 --> 07:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:38:45.510 --> 07:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm just saying that there's things
 
07:38:48.070 --> 07:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
that could be cleaned up better to to
 
07:38:50.310 --> 07:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
make our this this overall statutory
 
07:38:52.868 --> 07:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
scheme more uh resilient over the long
 
07:38:55.190 --> 07:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
term and you know make sure it's just
 
07:38:58.150 --> 07:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
a meeting you know in this case a
 
07:39:00.628 --> 07:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
federal requirement it's it's a minor
 
07:39:02.788 --> 07:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
provider fix i think thank you i hope
 
07:39:05.830 --> 07:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
you can provide guidance to the uh
 
07:39:07.350 --> 07:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that sure
 
07:39:08.948 --> 07:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
07:39:11.030 --> 07:39:11.040 align:start position:0%

07:39:13.350 --> 07:39:13.360 align:start position:0%

um i don't have a
 
07:39:41.670 --> 07:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
my name is eric wind first of all and
 
07:39:43.190 --> 07:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a senior advisor at the public
 
07:39:45.430 --> 07:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
utilities commission and an attorney
 
07:39:47.510 --> 07:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have extensive testimony i can
 
07:39:49.030 --> 07:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
just report that we're pleased to have
 
07:39:50.310 --> 07:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
been able to work with our colleagues at
 
07:39:52.708 --> 07:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
07:39:54.708 --> 07:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
to do this house to prepare this house
 
07:39:57.670 --> 07:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
cleaning legislation
 
07:39:59.430 --> 07:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm mostly just here to answer any
 
07:40:01.750 --> 07:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions that may arise so
 
07:40:01.760 --> 07:40:03.190 align:start position:0%
questions that may arise so
hearing

07:40:03.190 --> 07:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
07:40:04.548 --> 07:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
some of the previous questions and
 
07:40:07.110 --> 07:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
testimony i will address a few
 
07:40:08.708 --> 07:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
things first of all
 
07:40:10.788 --> 07:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
the audit function is something that the
 
07:40:12.948 --> 07:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
commission considers a high priority the
 
07:40:14.948 --> 07:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
ability to direct
 
07:40:16.388 --> 07:40:16.398 align:start position:0%
the department of energy's audit
 
07:40:18.868 --> 07:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
department to perform audits on certain
 
07:40:21.590 --> 07:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
issues if it deems it necessary and that
 
07:40:23.110 --> 07:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
really is a matter of administrative
 
07:40:25.670 --> 07:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency if the commission at this
 
07:40:28.310 --> 07:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
point were to simply request
 
07:40:30.310 --> 07:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
the um department of energy to perform a
 
07:40:31.830 --> 07:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
certain audit it's not to say that they
 
07:40:33.750 --> 07:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't turn that they would be likely
 
07:40:35.350 --> 07:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
to turn it down
 
07:40:35.360 --> 07:40:36.310 align:start position:0%
to turn it down
but

07:40:36.310 --> 07:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:40:37.750 --> 07:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
07:40:41.230 --> 07:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
prevents any scenario where
 
07:40:44.150 --> 07:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
duplicative staff has to be employed or
 
07:40:46.468 --> 07:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
an rfp to seek outside
 
07:40:48.070 --> 07:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
services has to be gone through in order
 
07:40:49.910 --> 07:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
to have such an audit performed if the
 
07:40:52.468 --> 07:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
commission finds it necessary
 
07:40:54.868 --> 07:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
there was also a question about staffing
 
07:40:57.110 --> 07:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i did a head count in my
 
07:40:58.708 --> 07:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
head right now and the commission has a
 
07:41:01.190 --> 07:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
total of 14 staff right now including
 
07:41:02.868 --> 07:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
the three full-time commissioners and
 
07:41:05.430 --> 07:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
the one special commissioner so 10
 
07:41:07.110 --> 07:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
support staff supporting the members of
 
07:41:08.868 --> 07:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
07:41:10.948 --> 07:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
with that said i'm happy to answer any
 
07:41:12.708 --> 07:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
further questions on any other
 
07:41:12.718 --> 07:41:14.070 align:start position:0%
further questions on any other
matters

07:41:14.070 --> 07:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
matters
 
07:41:15.750 --> 07:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
i guess before that i'm sorry to
 
07:41:18.070 --> 07:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
backtrack a little um
 
07:41:21.030 --> 07:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
the two ones that i would categorize as
 
07:41:22.868 --> 07:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
most in need of further study from the
 
07:41:24.788 --> 07:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
commission's perspective right now
 
07:41:28.310 --> 07:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
do relate to poll attachments and um
 
07:41:30.150 --> 07:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not to move community power
 
07:41:32.150 --> 07:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
aggregation review
 
07:41:33.830 --> 07:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
um so i can answer questions if there
 
07:41:35.830 --> 07:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
are any on those specific subjects but
 
07:41:37.670 --> 07:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
those are the two areas that kind of
 
07:41:39.590 --> 07:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
raise the most eyebrows and that we have
 
07:41:42.628 --> 07:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
ongoing questions about
 
07:41:44.548 --> 07:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
well i have a question uh thank you very
 
07:41:46.830 --> 07:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
much for for that
 
07:41:48.788 --> 07:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
introduction did i understand you
 
07:41:51.030 --> 07:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
correctly to say that you did work
 
07:41:53.270 --> 07:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
directly with
 
07:41:56.628 --> 07:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
mr shulock uh and others to
 
07:41:57.830 --> 07:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
put together
 
07:41:59.910 --> 07:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
the suggested amendments that we're
 
07:42:02.230 --> 07:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
looking at here
 
07:42:02.240 --> 07:42:03.350 align:start position:0%
looking at here
the

07:42:03.350 --> 07:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:42:04.948 --> 07:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
either members of the commission or
 
07:42:06.388 --> 07:42:06.398 align:start position:0%
staff of the commission have worked
 
07:42:08.708 --> 07:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
directly with the department of energy i
 
07:42:10.628 --> 07:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
did not become involved in this until
 
07:42:12.310 --> 07:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday but i did sit down with mr
 
07:42:13.830 --> 07:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
shulock yesterday and had some
 
07:42:15.430 --> 07:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary discussions and went over
 
07:42:17.590 --> 07:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
these matters and so i'm i can report
 
07:42:17.600 --> 07:42:18.628 align:start position:0%
these matters and so i'm i can report
that

07:42:18.628 --> 07:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:42:20.548 --> 07:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
what's in the version as filed the
 
07:42:21.990 --> 07:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
commission either supports or does not
 
07:42:23.990 --> 07:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
take a position on
 
07:42:25.990 --> 07:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay excellent great thank you
 
07:42:30.150 --> 07:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh additional questions for mr wind
 
07:42:32.708 --> 07:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
come on folks this is your chance to
 
07:42:35.830 --> 07:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
really understand this stuff
 
07:42:35.840 --> 07:42:37.670 align:start position:0%
really understand this stuff
okay

07:42:37.670 --> 07:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:42:39.830 --> 07:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative platt i'm reticent
 
07:42:41.110 --> 07:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
with questions because they think
 
07:42:42.948 --> 07:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
they're premature a study committee has
 
07:42:44.948 --> 07:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
to do its work then questions are
 
07:42:44.958 --> 07:42:47.030 align:start position:0%
to do its work then questions are
appropriate

07:42:47.030 --> 07:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
07:42:48.708 --> 07:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
well the subcommittee i think is going
 
07:42:48.718 --> 07:42:50.468 align:start position:0%
well the subcommittee i think is going
to

07:42:50.468 --> 07:42:50.478 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:42:51.750 --> 07:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a study committee it's a
 
07:42:51.760 --> 07:42:53.350 align:start position:0%
it's not a study committee it's a
subcommittee

07:42:53.350 --> 07:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
07:42:55.030 --> 07:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
and i think they're going to be putting
 
07:42:57.030 --> 07:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
together an amendment
 
07:42:58.548 --> 07:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
representative harrington might want to
 
07:43:00.070 --> 07:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
speak to that point what do you think
 
07:43:01.910 --> 07:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee will do representative
 
07:43:05.430 --> 07:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
harry well the goal is to um take the
 
07:43:07.110 --> 07:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
this input that we've had today and any
 
07:43:08.708 --> 07:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
others that people can provide us during
 
07:43:10.788 --> 07:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee uh meetings and to come
 
07:43:13.190 --> 07:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
up with an amendment that would uh try
 
07:43:14.708 --> 07:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
to clean up as many loose ends as
 
07:43:17.190 --> 07:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
possible for this again this is one
 
07:43:20.230 --> 07:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
where we don't want uh perfect to
 
07:43:22.628 --> 07:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
prevent good because some things we're
 
07:43:24.708 --> 07:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to know how to make
 
07:43:27.110 --> 07:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
them best until people are actually out
 
07:43:28.868 --> 07:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
there doing them for another six months
 
07:43:30.868 --> 07:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
or a year so i'm sure this will not be
 
07:43:33.190 --> 07:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
the very last uh bill that we address on
 
07:43:34.948 --> 07:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
this thing but hopefully we can correct
 
07:43:37.430 --> 07:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
as much as possible so we're looking for
 
07:43:39.830 --> 07:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh import in i know because of this is
 
07:43:42.310 --> 07:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
running very late now but certainly uh
 
07:43:43.910 --> 07:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
well i would look for input from the
 
07:43:47.350 --> 07:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
utilities on the subcommittee uh as well
 
07:43:49.750 --> 07:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
and any anybody else that could help out
 
07:43:51.030 --> 07:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
but that would be the goal up with an
 
07:43:51.040 --> 07:43:52.150 align:start position:0%
but that would be the goal up with an
amendment

07:43:52.150 --> 07:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:43:53.990 --> 07:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative samsit
 
07:43:57.750 --> 07:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:00.150 --> 07:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
yes i do mr chairman thank you and uh
 
07:44:01.510 --> 07:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr winn
 
07:44:04.230 --> 07:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh i just wanted to highlight again or
 
07:44:06.230 --> 07:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
just ask you because you just
 
07:44:08.150 --> 07:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
volunteered something
 
07:44:10.868 --> 07:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
what do you think are the
 
07:44:12.868 --> 07:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
maybe the top three
 
07:44:12.878 --> 07:44:14.070 align:start position:0%
maybe the top three
basic

07:44:14.070 --> 07:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
basic
 
07:44:15.830 --> 07:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
most important concerns from your
 
07:44:17.670 --> 07:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
perspective from the puc you already
 
07:44:17.680 --> 07:44:18.548 align:start position:0%
perspective from the puc you already
mentioned

07:44:18.548 --> 07:44:18.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
07:44:20.070 --> 07:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
the poll issue
 
07:44:22.310 --> 07:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
and also the community power is there
 
07:44:24.708 --> 07:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
anything else that's considered to be
 
07:44:31.990 --> 07:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:34.548 --> 07:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll clarify that with the
 
07:44:37.590 --> 07:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
poll issue and the community power
 
07:44:39.750 --> 07:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
there are factors that we want to make
 
07:44:41.750 --> 07:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure are considered
 
07:44:43.750 --> 07:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
in making the right decision and having
 
07:44:45.430 --> 07:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
the general court here make the right
 
07:44:45.440 --> 07:44:46.788 align:start position:0%
the general court here make the right
decision

07:44:46.788 --> 07:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
decision
 
07:44:49.110 --> 07:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
as far as where that authority lies and
 
07:44:51.030 --> 07:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
i think that that gets into policy and
 
07:44:53.270 --> 07:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
gets into substance and the
 
07:44:55.110 --> 07:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
commission is not
 
07:44:57.990 --> 07:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
going to volunteer policy
 
07:44:59.670 --> 07:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
um opinions that's the job of the
 
07:45:01.350 --> 07:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
07:45:04.070 --> 07:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
um but
 
07:45:06.070 --> 07:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
there are just other factors that i
 
07:45:07.670 --> 07:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
think would need to be clarified or
 
07:45:09.510 --> 07:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
flushed out through a more deliberative
 
07:45:09.520 --> 07:45:10.548 align:start position:0%
flushed out through a more deliberative
process

07:45:10.548 --> 07:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
process
 
07:45:13.030 --> 07:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
um as far as the
 
07:45:15.190 --> 07:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
what of the requests before you today in
 
07:45:18.070 --> 07:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
the um legislation is introduced the
 
07:45:20.388 --> 07:45:20.398 align:start position:0%
priorities of the commission
 
07:45:31.590 --> 07:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:34.070 --> 07:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
section 11 of the bill require regarding
 
07:45:35.830 --> 07:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
affiliate agreements i think that that
 
07:45:35.840 --> 07:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
affiliate agreements i think that that
needs

07:45:37.510 --> 07:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
needs
 
07:45:39.590 --> 07:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
some resolution because it would appear
 
07:45:42.708 --> 07:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
to create more work for the commission
 
07:45:42.718 --> 07:45:44.628 align:start position:0%
to create more work for the commission
presently

07:45:44.628 --> 07:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
presently
 
07:45:44.638 --> 07:45:45.350 align:start position:0%
presently
the

07:45:45.350 --> 07:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:45:47.910 --> 07:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
commission receives affiliate agreements
 
07:45:50.628 --> 07:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
between utilities or utility entities
 
07:45:52.868 --> 07:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
and the ability and has the ability to
 
07:45:55.110 --> 07:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
review them but is not required to take
 
07:45:57.350 --> 07:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
the affirmative step of approving it
 
07:45:58.868 --> 07:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
and so that seems to be in the
 
07:46:00.468 --> 07:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
07:46:02.788 --> 07:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
an affirmative approval is now required
 
07:46:03.830 --> 07:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we just want to make sure that
 
07:46:10.628 --> 07:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:13.910 --> 07:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
i believe there was one other um
 
07:46:13.920 --> 07:46:14.708 align:start position:0%
i believe there was one other um
that

07:46:14.708 --> 07:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:46:16.788 --> 07:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
is a commission request and would be a
 
07:46:18.868 --> 07:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
priority of section 17
 
07:46:20.070 --> 07:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
07:46:23.110 --> 07:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
a slight tweak to that in the first
 
07:46:25.430 --> 07:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
sentence would add and the commission
 
07:46:27.590 --> 07:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
following the department
 
07:46:29.270 --> 07:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
to authorize the commission to
 
07:46:30.948 --> 07:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
participate in matters before the
 
07:46:32.868 --> 07:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
federal energy regulatory commission and
 
07:46:34.310 --> 07:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
other bodies
 
07:46:36.468 --> 07:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
there are just some scenarios that have
 
07:46:37.830 --> 07:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
we can think of
 
07:46:39.990 --> 07:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
where the commission may also need to be
 
07:46:43.590 --> 07:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
authorized to appear before ferc
 
07:46:47.990 --> 07:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:54.388 --> 07:46:54.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:59.190 --> 07:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:02.708 --> 07:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:04.150 --> 07:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thanks for taking my
 
07:47:06.868 --> 07:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
question um i had a question on the last
 
07:47:09.430 --> 07:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
page i guess section 20 going back to
 
07:47:10.868 --> 07:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
the repeals
 
07:47:13.110 --> 07:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
so we hit two and three
 
07:47:15.110 --> 07:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i was looking at number one
 
07:47:17.030 --> 07:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
and if i'm looking at the right rsa
 
07:47:19.670 --> 07:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
which i hope i am it seems to be
 
07:47:22.948 --> 07:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
repealing the requirement that no member
 
07:47:27.350 --> 07:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the commission um shall also be
 
07:47:29.830 --> 07:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
either on the legal team of a public
 
07:47:31.350 --> 07:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
utility or
 
07:47:33.830 --> 07:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
rendering any professional service um
 
07:47:35.990 --> 07:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
can you just speak to
 
07:47:38.388 --> 07:47:38.398 align:start position:0%
have you seen that um prohibition
 
07:47:40.868 --> 07:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
causing any trouble or why is that being
 
07:47:40.878 --> 07:47:42.388 align:start position:0%
causing any trouble or why is that being
repealed

07:47:42.388 --> 07:47:42.398 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
07:47:43.910 --> 07:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
so i think i can give a little bit of
 
07:47:45.670 --> 07:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
color on that without deferring to the
 
07:47:47.270 --> 07:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
department of energy my understanding is
 
07:47:48.230 --> 07:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
that this is one that they have
 
07:47:50.150 --> 07:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
requested but my understanding is also
 
07:47:52.628 --> 07:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
that it is duplicative of a statutory
 
07:47:55.750 --> 07:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
provision in chapter 363 so i don't
 
07:47:57.030 --> 07:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
believe that anything is actually being
 
07:47:59.190 --> 07:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
repealed here but it's a duplicative
 
07:47:59.200 --> 07:48:02.708 align:start position:0%
repealed here but it's a duplicative
provision

07:48:02.708 --> 07:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:05.350 --> 07:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
07:48:07.670 --> 07:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay any further
 
07:48:07.680 --> 07:48:09.670 align:start position:0%
okay any further
questions

07:48:09.670 --> 07:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:48:11.270 --> 07:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you mr winn for

07:48:20.230 --> 07:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh and we thank you uh
 
07:48:22.230 --> 07:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
members of the department of energy for
 
07:48:23.430 --> 07:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
being here
 
07:48:26.388 --> 07:48:26.398 align:start position:0%
and the honorable clifton below
 
07:48:28.070 --> 07:48:28.080 align:start position:0%

here today so our next order of business
 
07:48:35.030 --> 07:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the public hearing
 
07:48:37.350 --> 07:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
on this bill but our next order of
 
07:48:40.708 --> 07:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
business will be to form a subcommittee
 
07:48:40.718 --> 07:48:43.110 align:start position:0%
business will be to form a subcommittee
to

07:48:43.110 --> 07:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:45.510 --> 07:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
get to work on producing this amendment
 
07:48:47.750 --> 07:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
so i know representative harrington is
 
07:48:49.430 --> 07:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to lead the subcommittee
 
07:48:51.350 --> 07:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative plett has volunteered to
 
07:48:53.110 --> 07:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
be on the subcommittee
 
07:48:55.350 --> 07:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative samsich wants to be on
 
07:48:57.670 --> 07:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
the committee representative mcgee wants
 
07:48:59.750 --> 07:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be on the committee
 
07:49:01.030 --> 07:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:49:04.628 --> 07:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:06.468 --> 07:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
we need one more member of the majority
 
07:49:13.590 --> 07:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:15.270 --> 07:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi would you be on
 
07:49:19.190 --> 07:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:23.110 --> 07:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:26.468 --> 07:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
i love volunteers volunteers are great
 
07:49:26.478 --> 07:49:27.590 align:start position:0%
i love volunteers volunteers are great
and

07:49:27.590 --> 07:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:49:29.830 --> 07:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we have a subcommittee set
 
07:49:33.110 --> 07:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative harrington will organize
 
07:49:34.468 --> 07:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
the first meeting
 
07:49:36.548 --> 07:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
i suspect there will be more than one to
 
07:49:39.670 --> 07:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:41.270 --> 07:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is not an early bill so we don't
 
07:49:44.468 --> 07:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
have to execute
 
07:49:46.788 --> 07:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
probably as late as early march we could
 
07:49:46.798 --> 07:49:47.910 align:start position:0%
probably as late as early march we could
execute

07:49:47.910 --> 07:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
execute
 
07:49:49.350 --> 07:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
so you've got some time to put it
 
07:49:51.990 --> 07:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
together but um you need to get started
 
07:49:53.670 --> 07:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
i think because it looks like it's
 
07:49:55.990 --> 07:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
complex process i'll talk with you later
 
07:49:57.350 --> 07:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
about how to set up the meetings and
 
07:49:59.110 --> 07:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
which rooms are available and so forth
 
07:50:00.628 --> 07:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
so right because i know that's a little
 
07:50:02.548 --> 07:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
more complicated than it has been in the
 
07:50:02.558 --> 07:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
more complicated than it has been in the
past

07:50:03.990 --> 07:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
past
 
07:50:06.548 --> 07:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
and with that i will thank you all for
 
07:50:07.910 --> 07:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
being here today
