in Auburn um I'm here to introduce HB
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
1347 um and uh upfront I want to point
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
out that uh the this committee has my
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
apologies uh this bill is a little bit
 
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
of an embarrassment to me this comes
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
across as very
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
xenophobic and it wasn't intended that
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
way and because uh it I of of what I
 
00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
just said I I I think I owe you an
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
explanation back in September I think it
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
was when we were supposed to be
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
submitting bills I was under a double
 
00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
whammy I had my leg in a cast and nonwe
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
bearing cast and I was taking some pain
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
medication at the same time I was
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
recovering from a a dog bite infection
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
and I was a little delusional from the
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
drugs I was taken from that and so when
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
I submitted this bill uh I submitted it
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
with a different intent and I don't
 
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 align:start position:0%
think it was drafted in consistent with
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
my intent I think the the attorney um
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
made an assumption I believe and this
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
turned into being a focus on just the
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
resettlement program which was never my
 
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
intent I I I'm I'm fairly familiar with
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
the uh Refugee resettlement program and
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm generally comfortable with it I I
 
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
don't think our Afghan visitors were
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
screened properly and and there's
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit of a of a a
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
problem in that community that we don't
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
know about yet but but in general I'm
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay with the settlement Refugee
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
resettlement program and I'm not after
 
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
it what what what I had intended to do
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
though was
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
recognizing that uh we have an A a wave
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
of immigrants coming across our
 
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
border a great millions of them who are
 
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919 align:start position:0%
not going through ports of Entry many of
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
them are uh called Goda ways that escape
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh the efforts to catch them in the
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
interior and even those that uh get in
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh and often cases they they they lie
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
and they claim Asylum uh for political
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
persecution and they're given a court
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
date that's five years in
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
advance now I'm not a lawyer so I don't
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
know what to call that category of
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
people who enter our country under
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
illegal means who get a temporary
 
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
permission slip to stay in the country
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
or those who got away who Who hide in
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
the shadows of our society I don't know
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
what to call those people um uh in in a
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
legal way that would be put into the
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
bill but if you'll accept that there's
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
some term or terms that would describe
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
that sort of illegal uh uh set of people
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
who were here with
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
without uh respect for our laws really
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
um then then you'll understand what I'm
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do is with that group of
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
people I'm saying if you come into New
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you start to try to Avail
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
yourself of DHHS resources I mean the
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
resettlement program is just but one
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
example and and somehow it you know when
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
when this came back to me I was I was so
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
out of it I never noticed that it's it
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
was so narrowly focused my intent was to
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
take all of the DHHS programs of which
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
there are probably 20 or more that
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
provide some kind of support for the
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
social determinant of care housing food
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh and the like and I wanted to
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say to our citizens and
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
those who are actually legal guests of
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
our country um you have first priority
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
on these scarce resources that we put
 
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.069 align:start position:0%
on these scarce resources that we put
into

00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS and that this other category of
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
folks who are here in in properly um uh
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
or under the
 
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
radar if they show up at a DHHS
 
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.790 align:start position:0%
radar if they show up at a DHHS
eligibility

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
site I I would want to make sure
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
that they did not start to
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
receive the benefits that we're spending
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money on until we have fully
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
satisfied the needs of our own
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
citizens uh and uh and that that was
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
what I intended to do with this bill um
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
because I was a bad legislator in
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
September and October that that's not
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
what has shown up here at your your
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
doorstep and again I apologize for that
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh you can either kill this bill or
 
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
amend this bill but I I I at least want
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
to tell my constituents that I cared
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
about protecting taxpayer money to
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that our citizens get first
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
priority for the services that they're
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
paying for and that those that have
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
entered the nation
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
illegally um uh are not first in line in
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
New York City I understand stand they're
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
about to hand out
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh each uh debit cards to have
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
those who are here illegally receive
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
great benefit they're getting the
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
reparations that that our
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
African-American Community has been
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
asking for for 50 years they're they're
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
just being given
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
$10,000 and I don't want that to happen
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I don't want anything
 
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
like that to happen I want to be pure
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
from um from a program dramatic
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
perspective that we prioritize New
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens now at the end of the
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
day if there's still some money
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
available and there's some and there's
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
still a need out
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
there I I I I guess I'd be kind of open
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
to that but I I just want to make sure
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
that uh our people are know that they're
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
first and that we respect the fact that
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's their money and it's their state
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
and that we're trying to protect it and
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
and help them out and so uh uh I guess
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
in summary I really don't like this bill
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
U but I I I do think it's a platform for
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
discussion and potentially uh a really
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
smart amendment that would protect our
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
citizens um but um with that I'll I'll
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if there are any
 
00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:24.069 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if there are any
representative

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards for
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question question um I really
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate your explanation of why the
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill is as it is and it's the Bill's
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
horrible as it is yeah and it didn't
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
meet your intentions I'm glad to hear
 
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
meet your intentions I'm glad to hear
that

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so you spoke about people coming
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
across the border illegally and I would
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
agree that it is a huge problem and that
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
have no legal
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
documentation but
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding as it is mine
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
that there are many many people who have
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
some form of legal status but are not
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
citizens so they may be in the middle of
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
a process of applying for um
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
Asylum um or they may be um awaiting a
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on that or they may have
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
temporary protected status because of
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of um disaster so that would
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
you agree that that there are it's not a
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
black and white situation of legal and
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
illegal but there are all kinds of
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
people with various
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
statuses would you agree with
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
that I I I I would shift the black and
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
white nature of the of where we're what
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I um illegal legal
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
is is is not the right black and white
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
definition okay um what uh would be more
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate would would be to to find
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
that other category where that we can
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
Define this other couple of categories
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
one category I would hope we could all
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
agree on uh would be uh the category
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
that avoided points of Entry that
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
eluded Federal um intervention and
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
documentation those people who are the
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
Goda ways who are are free floaters in
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
the society where we have no real
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
knowledge of them there there is that
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
category and it's not
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
insignificant that is the group that I
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
would think that we could all agree on
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
probably ought not to be uh equally in
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
line with the New Hampshire citizen so
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
if if if that's one point of
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
demarcation what's the next area and
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
this is a good policy conver ation I
 
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
think you've you've hit on it is that
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
there is a group of people who um did uh
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
get um processed by the federal
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
government that did uh
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
claim political
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
Asylum that were under the federal laws
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
given a hearing date those hearing dates
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
from what I understand some of them are
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
as far out into the future as 2032
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
that may that's probably an exception
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
and not the rule but these hearing dates
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
are four five years out right year year
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
now just just to like wrap up the
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
thought there because there's another
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
piece to this and that is that it I
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
think it is widely and universally known
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
in in that illegal immigrant crowd that
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
uh the permission slip into the United
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
States is to falsely claim political
 
00:16:58.279 --> 00:16:59.389 align:start position:0%
States is to falsely claim political
Asylum

00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
Asylum
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
when they're here for economic
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
reasons because they
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
lie they are given a court hearing to
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
check their political Asylum if in that
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
court hearing it's found that they did
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
they're not here for political
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
persecution they're really here for
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
economic reasons they are not eligible
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
to be in the United States and that they
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
are subject to deportation right and so
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
we have this massive abuse of the
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
federal system and and there exists a
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
category that I think Common Sense
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
people know is being grossly
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
abused as a matter of policy though do
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
we want to try to carve out those that
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
do have a federal permission slip to
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
stay for a hearing from those who were
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
clearly undocumented thoroughly and and
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably a category that
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
this committee would not uh want to
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the priority for them I I I and I
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
and I that might be fair but this other
 
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
category that's clearly here in an
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
undocumented status intentionally I
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
think we we don't want to be um putting
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
them equally in line with New Hampshire
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
citizens I that's a long answer I hope
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
it was thorough and and comprehensive or
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
comprehendable well follow up thank you
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I think I got it um so given that
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does not really address the
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue that you're concerned about um
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
what would you think about the
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of us itl in this bill and
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
future creating some kind of
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
conversation for the for the legislature
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire about
 
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
immigration and its effect on New
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that could be done in
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
the form of a caucus it could be done in
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
for in the form of a study committee um
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
but where a bipartisan group of
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
legislators actually addressed the way
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is being addressed by
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
immigration the um great um gifts that
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
it's given us the problems that it's
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
caused how to move forward in the future
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we want to um position
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves in terms of um
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
both being a place that attracts
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
immigrants um for our Workforce and
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
um you know addresses problems um that
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
you're probably um more aware of than I
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
am um but what would you think of doing
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
away with this bill and creating some
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
kind of format for addressing the bigger
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
issue so so you you bring up two issues
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
and so I'll start with the the one where
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
we can agree to agree I think it's
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
always a good idea when there's a
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
special problem that's
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
emerging uh that uh a caucus of some
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
kind or a group of legislators get
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
together to increase awareness of the
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
problem and and you know and bring in
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
outside subject matter experts to help
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
inform us so that we we do some smart
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
things hopefully in the future so I'm
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
I'm all in favor of the second part of
 
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
what you said in terms of the
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
disposition I of this particular bill it
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's now in the hands of the committee
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh I uh if you ited it because it's just
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
a sloppy piece of work uh and that's on
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's on me I I apologize again but if
 
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
you think that this is a legitimate
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
issue uh and that uh it could be amended
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
then this is a platform at least to keep
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
it the the the uh the the policy alive
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
and hopefully enough to get it over to
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate because I think uh the the
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
the issue is is getting to be very ripe
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's getting to be timely if we kill
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't know that there's
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
another vehicle until January of next
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
year and and we could be in a completely
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
different situation in January so
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee does I respect
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
the decision I I personally would prefer
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
to see U an amendment than um killing it
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
wber thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just as a
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary thing there's always an ad
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
hoc committee appointed by the chair of
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
this committee to study anything that is
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
within the purview of this committee but
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
is uh because your preferences for
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
drafting an
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
amendment um I note that even after some
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
clarity and some thought you the prime
 
00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
clarity and some thought you the prime
sponsor

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
are having difficulty articulating to us
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
how we would draft for the benefit of
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS the category of people that you're
 
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
looking for because if I understanding
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
correctly first of all they're people
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
with no documentation whatsoever and
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
those people don't get benefits secondly
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
there is a category that you are
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about out were the people who
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
lied and got a court
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
date how would you have us draft an
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that would
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
properly uh instruct
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS how to weed out those people who
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
had lied and gotten papers versus those
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
people who were genuine and had gotten
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
papers because on the face of it on
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
paper to me they look like just the same
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
thing so how would you distinguish and
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
how would we draft
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
that okay so uh I'm there's some Le
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
there is some legal terminology that
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
would be required that I don't really
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
know that may already exist and so I
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
would uh I I tried during the budget
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
process to bring this up but there were
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
280 other things literally in hb2 that
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
so I didn't find out about this the way
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
I wanted to but what the perception I
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
got is that this is a very uncomfortable
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
subject for
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I had a little bit of
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding somebody who would
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
engage me in a direct
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
thorough transparent way to help me
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
figure out what these definitions might
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
be I didn't have the time at the time um
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
so so I would need to rely to your
 
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
question on how would I go about
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
drafting it I would need to rely on some
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
legal experts to help come up with these
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
definitions of these
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
categories and and then I I I think with
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
the proper definitions of the categories
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
I there is language in here that isn't
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
so bad that could be tweaked Maybe to
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
say that uh New Hampshire citizens get
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
the priority and these other categories
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
get a lesser priority or or no priority
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't I if if the committee had
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
time it had the patience it had the
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
interest I think um an amendment could
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
be drafted but it's that's really truly
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
up to the discretion of the chair in the
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
committee follow up so as a followup to
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
what you just said can you understand
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
understand why it might be uncomfortable
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
for people in the
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
department to have to be asked to figure
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
out a way to be charged with determining
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
as between two people who have exactly
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
documentation which of those people
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
obtained that
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
documentation legally and honestly and
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
which person obtained that documentation
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
fraudulently how on Earth would they be
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
able to tell and is it possible that
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't have those legal
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
distinctions yes there's fraud if you
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
obtain the documents by fraud but that's
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
a whole different inquiry from what DHHS
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
does so so your first question is can I
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
understand DHHS is reluctance and and
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is yes because I'm
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
very empathetic and sensitive so yes I
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
can understand their reluctance um your
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
your your second part you you've created
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
a distinction that I have not you you
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
you you have uh said that I would like a
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
category that distinguishes between
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
those who are awaiting their court
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
hearing in an ethical way because they
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
truly are victims of political uh uh
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
persecution versus those who have lied
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
to obtain it I I have never even
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
suggested that I don't think that's even
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
possible for the Department to do that I
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
I drew a line back where it's earlier to
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
say um uh those that that have no no
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
documentations and you've you've made an
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
assertion that's probably true because I
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
I trust your knowledge and and judgment
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
that if they have no documentation they
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
get no benefits I that that is an
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
assertion that I would like to to be
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
believe is true but I'm not uh um 100%
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
confident in
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
that thank you and my apologies if I
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstood what I thought you were
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
hearing how could you understand this
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
it's a really bad Bill right now that's
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
my fault well it was it was the
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
conversation but I I I certainly am on
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
the side of people who want to continue
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
a conversation I I don't think this is
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
the vehicle but thank you representative
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
Seth King and then representative Kofa
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr CH and thank you
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards for taking
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions uh given we know two things um
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
that there will always be a need for New
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and United States
 
00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
citizens and two that the current system
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
of refugee resettlements the immigration
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
system is completely broken I would
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
argue weaponized in many ways
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
given those two things um would you be
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
open to the idea that state funds just
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
should not be uh given for assistance to
 
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
non United States citizens period and
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
then you take away all of the problems
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
we have with distinction and who's you
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
know finagled the system and who's lied
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
you just get rid of that whole thing and
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
just stay straight up if you're not a
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
United States citizen you don't get
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
direct uh state State funds assistance
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about that thank you
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay so so I'm going to say that
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
personally how I feel about it is that
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
um I I I think that that may be um too
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
too broad an effort to protect New
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens I I I do think that
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
as badly as everything's being managed
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
there's a legitimate value in the
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement program I I don't
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
care for the way it's being been done
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a it's a it's a valid
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
program uh at its core and I would not
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
exclude those people um without hearing
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
testimony on why they should be excluded
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
and I've not heard that the other
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
category of people that are awaiting a
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
disposition of their political Asylum
 
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.269 align:start position:0%
disposition of their political Asylum
claim

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm less patient with that category
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
because I believe the fraud is so
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
widespread that that I think as a matter
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
of policy we might we might want to
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
carve them out to say that they should
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
not be uh on equal footing with New
 
00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:49.470 align:start position:0%
not be uh on equal footing with New
Hampshire

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
citizens um but then in this third
 
00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
category of those with no documentation
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
I I I I think they're they're right for
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
us to um legislate that they do not
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
receive New Hampshire benefits does that
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
answer your question all right thank you
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
represent representative kofalt and then
 
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.630 align:start position:0%
represent representative kofalt and then
representative

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking that question the um so
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
to that last Point really are you aware
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
of are you aware of any circumstances
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
where somebody who has no documentation
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
whatsoever is receiving State assistance
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
so me know I I I I I live with my dogs
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
in Auburn I'm not involved in uh DHHS
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
internal eligibility and seeing the
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
specific example so so no uh and even if
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
it hasn't happened yet my concern is
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
that the there is nothing stopping the
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
wave of people coming across the border
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
nothing stopping it really so if it
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened yet it's I think it's
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
just a matter of time before we start to
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
see the uh the impact in New Hampshire
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
inevitable representative Paz off and
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
then representative Merchant thank you
 
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
question so my understanding of your
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
intention is that if somebody have
 
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.909 align:start position:0%
intention is that if somebody have
Federal

00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
documentation uh he or she should still
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
get services but if they don't have any
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
documentation they shouldn't but my
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
question would be somewhere in the
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
middle for example we have a federal
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
system uh to figure out uh whose claim
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
is uh illegitimate but it's multi-step
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
process uh for example uh somebody is
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
claiming political Asylum or marriage
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
with US citizen and then Officer says uh
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
denies uh uh thinks that it's not
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate but then the person can
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
appeal in the court and then there's a
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
second appeal so uh it's like several
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
steps before the person is put into
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
removal uh so what would be your
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
preference like uh is it like first fail
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh in interview with Federal Officer
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
should trigger the consolation of DS
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
services or is it just
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
removal uh I I do not think New
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be in the business of
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
second guessing uh what should be um uh
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
an established federal policy on once
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
they get a hearing date they enter into
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
a stage of adjudication and they have an
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
appeals process uh that's appropriate to
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
that and so so my my trigger for your
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also my
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
apologies to the committee and also to
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor for my T can get to
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
the meeting somewhat late and looking at
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
this I understand um representative
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
Edwards that you chair the division 3
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee which has oversight of
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
the budget for the Department of Health
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
Human Services could you share with us
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
how many dollars from the state F
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
treasury go into this program not
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that flow into the state
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
that get reallocated but actual State
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
dollars that we actually take out of
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers to fund this
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
program uh I don't have an auditable
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
number to give you um uh I I you use the
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
word singular Word program and I just
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if you're
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
thinking I'm talking just about the
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
resettle program I've I've I've made it
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
clear that I'm not you know that was
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
that's a drafting error in my opinion
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the the 20 or so
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
programs that are all over
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
DHHS that deal with providing uh social
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
determinants of care the the basic life
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
support stuff food Transportation
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
housing clothing you know all those all
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
those social determinant care it's a
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
defined term but um uh
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
I as far as how much money is getting
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
spent on on those
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
things General funds if we spent upwards
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
to a billion dollars a year on the
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
collective of that prog those programs I
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised I I think if I
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
were to leave you with a number today
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'd put it more like a half a billion
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
dollars a year on um various social
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
determinants of care programs of General
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
funds our our total budget I think is
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
about 3.2 billion a year and that
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
includes Federal money of which the
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
federal money is actually slightly
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
larger than the general fund
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
contribution follow up thank you Mr
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
chairman also thank you for taking the
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
question again represent Edwards in
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
regards to the amount of money we're
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
talking about is there some way that we
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
can break it apart because there are
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
many dollars that we spend on State
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
citizens that are actually residents of
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
the state citizens of the state they're
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
not going through Refugee programs and
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
so forth I don't want to commingle the
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
two um because I think we're trying to
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
get to is the refugees or people who are
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
using the funds that probably shouldn't
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
have the ability to use it but I'm not
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
really sure I understand exactly what
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get to because many of
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
those dollars are legitimate dollars and
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get into fraudulent
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
behavior and I don't know how we can
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
break it apart do you have any way to
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
break it apart and let us know so thank
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
you uh representative I I reject the use
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the word Refugee in this debate I've
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
I've I've tried to make it as clear as
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
possible that I'm not talking about the
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement program so I'm
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to say it again I am not talking
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
about the refugee resettlement program
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the Myriad of DHHS
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
programs that New Hampshire citizens are
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for to help cover their social
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
determinance of care uh and and I do I I
 
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
do think that uh our citizens would
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate knowing that we see this wave
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
coming and that we're trying to do
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
something we're trying to figure out
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
something to preserve their place in
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
line one of the things that I'm picking
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
up from the news media in New York City
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
is that the people of Harlem are just
 
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.470 align:start position:0%
is that the people of Harlem are just
really

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
incensed that they've been looking for
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
programs for decade or more that are
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
just being rolled out on behalf of the
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrant community and uh and I
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
think that sort of social anger is
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
something we should anticipate and we
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
should tell our own citizens we want to
 
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
prioritize you um and and I think that's
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
actually better for social stability if
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
we let those people who know who've been
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
paying into the system who work to pay
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
into the system that that that they're
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
our priority and that that's that's sort
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
of the the theme of what I'm trying to
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
go with with this bill representative
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my last question um
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um since um
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
there's been discussion about Asylum
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
seekers in particular and I'm not sure
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
what you said and what other people said
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
but I've heard them referred to as um
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know both people who are fleeing
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
persecution in their home countries and
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard them refer to essentially as
 
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.829 align:start position:0%
I've heard them refer to essentially as
Liars

00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
Liars
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
um different people not maybe not the
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
same people so given that and given your
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
statement that um you know you live at
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
home with your dogs and you're not
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
really in this world I'm wondering in in
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
anticipation of going further because as
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
you say this is an issue that's not
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
going away
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
if you would be willing to meet with um
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
if I could arrange it to meet with some
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
Asylum Seekers to kind of understand
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
some of their personal stories um about
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
the types of persecution they've fleed
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
and why they have done it and what it's
 
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
been like to actually go through the
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
process of applying for asylum in this
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
country which um you know I I've heard
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
some things that say it's kind of
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
stacked in their favor um I would tend
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
to disagree with that but any case my
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
question is would you be willing to meet
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
with a group of people who um this
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
discussion really is
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
affecting so the short answer is yes I
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
love everyone I want to meet as many
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
people here as many different points of
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
view as possible but I would just want
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
to let you know that as somebody who
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
spent a year in Afghanistan and two
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
years in Korea and been worried about
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
the uh World stability now for 40 years
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
that understand what that there's real
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
political persecution in the world I
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
don't doubt that some people really need
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
to flee here because of political
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
persecution political persecution is
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
protected under our federal law what's
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
not protected under our federal law are
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
economic refugees and and so in any
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
population of about 5 million random
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
people who are crashing our border there
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to be subsets of people that fall
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
into different categories and I would
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
hope as good honest people that we would
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
be able to accept that there is a fairly
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
significant class of or subset of that
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
population who are gaming the system
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
because they've been trained to gain the
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
system the materials to game the system
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
from Tick Tock to pamphlets is in that
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
IL Al immigration train that is Flowing
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
up from the south so I I I I I think I I
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think it could be a deflection to
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
focus on the the set that I'm I'm not
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
worried about which are the the refugees
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
that are here legitimately through the
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
program those people who are
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
legitimately fleeing political
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
persecution th those people have you
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
know my empathy and my support it's it's
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
those people who are abusing our system
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
and our good-naturedness uh and I and I
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
think I just from that group I want to
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
find a way to distinguish them and
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens from them thank you
 
00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Palazo
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
taking my second question uh so in terms
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
of abusing system I agree with you that
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh some uh uh people who claim political
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
Asylum actually here for economic
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
reasons but uh there were some cases uh
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
Federal cases with body shops when uh
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
employer uh sponsored uh immigration was
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh illegally abused and system was gamed
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the same there were some legal cases
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh with marriage based immigration when
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
they were fake marriages so if you ask
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
our committee to single
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
out um uh those claiming political
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
Asylum is it just based on
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
volume or is it both volume and some
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
data that that system is more abused
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
than immigration based for example on
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
marriage or on uh uh
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
employment so you make a a fine point
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
there there are many reasons why
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
somebody could um um uh get US
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
citizenship through valid means and and
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
some of those methods are abused too and
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
i' I've mentioned political Asylum
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
almost exclusively as as the category
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about and there's a
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that in these trains
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
of people that are coming up from south
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
of Mexico and through Mexico
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
there are training materials available
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
to them the cartels are making sure that
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
the people who are paying them thousands
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
of dollars to get across the border are
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
are adequately trained in order to game
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
our system so they are being taught to
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
claim political Asylum and that's that's
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
the eligibility condition that I think
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
is most abused now now for those people
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
who are worried about human trafficking
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
of which I'm one of them
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
there there are others who are are
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
abusing that part of it by uh
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
effectively uh kidnapping kids and using
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
them to to to bring families across and
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
then there are reports about how the
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
child once it gets through the process
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
gets sent back so that they could be
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
used again to support another group of
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
of uh illegal immigrants so so this
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
whole situation at the border is just
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
Madness and I I don't and I think it's
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
an existential threat to the nation too
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
by the way but but for now all I want to
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
do is tell New Hampshire
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we know you've paid into the
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
system we know you've built this system
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
and and you're our priority and we know
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
that there are the this other category
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
categories maybe of people who uh are in
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions taking from the
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers those benefits that are
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
rightly the the per province of the
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers they're
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
essentially well I'm not I want to say
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
stealing they're not stealing it because
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know elected people are giving it to
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
them but but but they're but it's being
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
taken away from taxpayers improperly and
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
I want to tell our citizens we're not
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
going to let that happen in New
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does that answer your question
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
so other
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I didn't realize this was
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to take this long but I I do
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the audience and the
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
questions and um if there's anything I
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
can do to further help with this process
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards just to review it's been the
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
practice of this committee uh that the
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor gets extra time to explain
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
the background of of the bill and um you
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
know why it's being introduced and and
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh other input that they may have
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
received we do ask all testimony to be
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
kept right around three minutes so that
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
allows extra time for questions of each
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh each person testifying and also to
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh everybody has a fair
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
shot at uh offering testimony to the
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
committee on the bill uh next person up
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
to testify and who um asked to testify
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
is Bob Dunn with the Roman Catholic
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
bishop of Manchester uh and you've asked
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
dun yes thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Bob Dunn the director
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
of public policy for the Roman Catholic
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
dasis of Manchester and I'm here today
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Bishop Peter labashi
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
respectfully to oppose this bill um my
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
testimony in opposition to this bill was
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the bill that uh the prime sponsor
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
has now essentially ask you to itl or to
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
change in some way so I won't belabor
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
the issue um the um what I would have
 
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
said is that um this is something which
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
I think uh as representative Edwards
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
alluded to on its face uh says that uh
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
people in the refugee program um don't
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
get services
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
um if there are unmet services for US
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
citizens and um we think that just is
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
not commensurate with human dignity the
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
folks in the refugee program are here um
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
under the refugee
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
program also um the uh Bill strikes me
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
as something that a more typically would
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
be found in house bill one or House Bill
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
two um it is talking about about the
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
allocation and appropriation and the use
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
of funds um and so to um pass something
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
like this takes uh something which uh
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
infers that it's a closed loop of
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
services um which it is a closed loop in
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
the context of the budget because the
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
budget is deciding what funds can be
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated for what purposes but it's
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
not a closed loop when it's in a advance
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the budget because the budget writers
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
can make any decision they want about
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
how funds are going to be allocated uh
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it at that and thank you
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
for your attention and Hospitality okay
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative n
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
Ram uh thank you for letting me ask a
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
question just curious um do you have any
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
idea how much money the Catholic Church
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
does expend with helping refugees
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
I I don't I know I know that was and I'm
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
not sure what categories I I do know
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
that obviously we we believe that the
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
Catholic church in New Hampshire is the
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
largest non-governmental provider of
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
charitable assistance across the board
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
how much of that um flows into what
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
areas I couldn't tell you okay thank you
 
00:48:50.359 --> 00:48:51.069 align:start position:0%
areas I couldn't tell you okay thank you
very

00:48:51.069 --> 00:48:51.079 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
much other
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Henry Harris
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
England good morning Mr Harris good
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
morning you've asked for five to 10
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
minutes that's I I can I can wrap that
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
up I clearly it sounds like a lot to
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
unpack yeah if you could do it in free
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
that'd be great yeah I can do that so I
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
mean I think you
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
know on a I'm not sure this is the
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate form to change this bill if
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
you go back to the 1980 Refugee
 
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.109 align:start position:0%
you go back to the 1980 Refugee
resettlement

00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
resettlement
 
00:49:38.119 --> 00:49:40.589 align:start position:0%
resettlement
act

00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
um where that those funds are are
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
generated for the refugee program which
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
is federally funded program it's not to
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
be confused with the Border crisis in
 
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.910 align:start position:0%
be confused with the Border crisis in
any

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
way um so I don't I don't even think
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
that this form is the correct one I'm
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
not a I'm not a representative I don't
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
understand the full proceedings but I
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
believe this would go back to your
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
you're trying to repurpose funds from an
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
act from 1980 and I don't think you can
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
do it from here um which brings me into
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
my next point do not confuse the refugee
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
crisis at the that's not or the crisis
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
at the border is not the refugee program
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
that settles here in New Hampshire that
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
is a federally funded program there are
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh compliance standards and check levels
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
at every process so from the
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
presidential determination which is
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
approved by Congress they decide how
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
many refugees come in it's a fixed
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
amount of people each year there's
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
funding and programs provided to support
 
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.030 align:start position:0%
funding and programs provided to support
Refugee

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
Refugee
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
resettlement it is not what's happening
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
at the border so everyone that comes
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
here pre- arrival through the refugee
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
resettlement program goes through years
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
to get into this this country there's at
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
each stage there's many vetting
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
processes out before they even come into
 
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.230 align:start position:0%
processes out before they even come into
this

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
country um and they go through
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
background checks and betting Ved to be
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
here um refugees enter this country
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
through that Pro program legally they
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
are immediately able to work enroll
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
their kids in school and pay
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
taxes they are regular citizens they are
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in our society as
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
Citizens so when we talk about These
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
funds and how they're allocated for New
 
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they are in the same category
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
as every other citizen who is applying
 
00:51:34.599 --> 00:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
as every other citizen who is applying
for

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
benefits um The International Institute
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
of New England and our colleagues at
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
centur Care Alliance we've been
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
resettling refugees in this manner for
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
over a hundred years this is a
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
proven process it works well please do
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
not confuse it with the everything
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's happening at the border that's a
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
completely different thing from what
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
this 19 1980 Refugee resettlement Act is
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
referring to it's completely
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
different um I believe um we talked
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
briefly I heard some comments about
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're an aging State um we've got young
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
people moving away we've got older
 
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
people retiring also moving away and or
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
going on fixed incomes our tax base is
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
shrinking refugees fit that bill I get
 
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:23.559 align:start position:0%
calls weekly from employers around the
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
state who want to connect with me and
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
our and our uh clients and get them
 
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
employed and we have lots of Pathways
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
career Pathways where we educate and we
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
train for what New Hampshire
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
needs um so I you know I think in
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
general I think we need to check whether
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is an legal or a legal um way to
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
approach changing this
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
bill um if you could start wrapping up
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
please I will and I think you know
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
referees taking money away from a proven
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
program that does work to try to fix
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
something that's unrelated to what the
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
original intent of this funding is is
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
not a responsible
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
solution because it's taking away from
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
services that are much needed here to

Workforce when I arrived in New
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 5 years ago from Rwanda s
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
Africa I was eager to work but I
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
encountered numerous obstacles in my
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
search for employment despite my 10
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
years of experience in communication in
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
Africa and the bachelor's degree in
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
journalism I struggled to find a job
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
matching my
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
qualifications I even had the
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work for the United
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
Nations development program instead I
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
took on physical demanding work in
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
Industries like construction to make end
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
me navigating my new home in the United
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
States was challenging fit but after
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
leaving my construction job I enrolled
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
in a community development policy and
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
practice program graduate courses and I
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
paid it free from my funds and um I was
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
also doing two jobs and caring for my
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
family I'm a father of four kids so my
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
experience is not unique many refugees
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
and ases they have the similar
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
challenges when they try to enter the
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
workforce in this state language
 
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
barriers cultural differences lack of
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
recognition of their foreign credentials
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
they prevent often those people like me
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
to access meaningful
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
life uh one of many accomplishment that
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
I had in this state is starting a
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
company that is called in New Hampshire
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
moving together
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
conversations last year in November the
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%

Business Leaders about the value and
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
Business Review voted my conference as
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%

Health and Human
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
Services and I just want to thank
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee we'll we'll certainly try to
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
keep our commentary down to three
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
minutes or less uh we just want to
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
clarify a few things that were discussed
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
I think the committee actually were
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
getting the answers and is right we just
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
want to confirm uh with you what our
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
department understanding is first the
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
department provided written testimony to
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
this committee because when we did
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
conducted our financial analysis on this
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
bill it was specifically directed to the
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Refugee uh um re uh
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
resettlement program in New Hampshire uh
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
I want to just make it very clear that
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
those are 100% General funds that's
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
getting to represent Merchant's question
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
when he started uh speaking about the
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
budgetary appropriation impact of the
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
bill that these are 100% federally
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
funded dollars
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
therefore as as and and out of very good
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
respect to representative Edwards the
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
bills Prime sponsor who readily said
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're not working off of the bill that's
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
in front of you but that's what we did
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
come prepared to discuss today and just
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure you had a common
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of some of the the factors
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
that are involved so uh first off 100%
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
federally funded so this language to
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
preclude State funding uh would not
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
impact that program because it's 100%
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
federally funded that's number one
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
number two is the questions regarding
 
01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
undocumented individuals receiving
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
assistance uh undocumented individuals
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
are not um permitted to receiving either
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
state or federal assistance so just want
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
to make that clear that was a question
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
that was asked that they don't receive
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
it so we just want to clarify that as to
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
the fraud issue when an individual comes
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
into Mr Hampton's program that we
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
administer they go through a federal
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
vetting so the issue of federal um
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
preemption and for the attorney Types on
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the committee that what it means is that
 
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
it's not a state issue necessarily but
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
it is a federal issue so before coming
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
to Ruben's uh uh program excuse Mr
 
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
Hampton's program they are vetted at the
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
federal level and they do go through a
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
screening through Homeland Security
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
which conducts at least 10 or more uh
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
various checks uh is there always
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
potential for fraud I know from your
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
chairman uh that he served very
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
dutifully as a fraud investigator and we
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
do actually as our own agency uh once we
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
do have all all individuals that we're
 
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
serving we do look to fraud to make sure
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's not happening with all the people
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
that we're serving not just those who
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
are refugees so the point I think we're
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
trying to make is before the indivisual
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
even comes into our program they've gone
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
through a federal vending and it's the
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
federal government that makes
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
determination whether or not they're
 
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
granted the uh authority to becoming uh
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
and receiving those services that is a
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
lot of winded worded that I said and I
 
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
think chairman I would turned it over to
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
you for questions uh from the committee
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
but we just wanted to make those points
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
very very clear as you move forward with
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
the decision what to do with the underly
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
Bill and whether or not you want to
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
conduct uh further study research on the
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
more larger issue uh that was raised by
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
the Bill's print sponsor KY Williams is
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
the refugee cash assistance program
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
still in effect the eight-month program
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's still there it is currently 12
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
months but yes it is still in effect
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay great uh representative Murphy
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to be
 
01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.829 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to be
clear

01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
that the 100% federally funded under the
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
refugee Act of 1980 those f funds cannot
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
be diverted to any um social determinant
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
efforts in the state is that
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative mph
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
those funds can only be used for the
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
program itself and cannot be redirected
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
to any social determinant program they
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
can only be used for the program and its
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
clients thank
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is um exactly what
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
you said that if someone is fully
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
um benefits um correct in the state um
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
but is it not true in terms of an
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
earlier question about only citizens
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
receiving Federal benefits in the state
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that when we apply for
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid expansion not this P time
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
but the time before we specifically
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
requested a waiver to exclude
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
non-citizens and that was rejected by
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
government um I I'll take the first
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
attempt at this uh because that actually
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
U falls under under social deter to
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
health we're talking Medicaid and that's
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
why I took the microphone very quickly
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
as refo as a prime sponsor for one of
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
those initiatives I'm sure others uh
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
that uh certainly New Hampshire and in
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
this legislature adopted a policy to
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
extend the coverage for uh pregnant
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
women and children as it relates uh but
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
those individuals I are 100% documented
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of receiving those assisten
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
these are not undocumented individuals
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm not speaking correctly I'm going
 
01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:16.839 align:start position:0%
to ask Mr Hampton or anyone else from
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
our shop behind me to respond to that
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
toif there's a sometimes a fiveyear
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
waiting period if you were to come here
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
and you might not be a citizen but you
 
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
might be a a legal resident of this
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
country right and you know be able to
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
receive benefits there's typically
 
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
fiveyear waiting period for that however
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
that is removed for uh pregnant women
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
and children I believe that maybe what
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
you referring to follow
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman actually I'm
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
speaking more broadly um and um I'm well
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
aware of that bill but um I'm speaking
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
more broadly for example um in my
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
we have a young Afghan family who came
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
they were evacuated from
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan in August two years ago they
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
worked for the American Military um they
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
were brought to this country they were
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
resettled by um a group in Keen but
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
through a century Care Alliance um that
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
family received Medicaid as soon as they
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
got here um and
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
um they no longer are on Medicaid
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
because they work and they earn a living
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
and they get um employment um based
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
benefits but is it not true that um it
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
would be illegal for us to ban
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
noncitizens in New Hampshire from
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
getting programs like Medicaid and
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
represent Shiro I always get very
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
confused when I hear is it not true
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
because I'm always trying to figure out
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is which I'm just trying to get to
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
the point um so let's be very very clear
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
that the individuals are receiving
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefits are one documented two
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
if it's through the um uh program that
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
Mr hampon administering for Refugee
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
resettlement they've already gone
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
through the process of being uh given a
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
grant and therefore are documented
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
receiving uh that assistance if they are
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
not documented then they would not be
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
entitled to receiving that I just want
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
to be 100% clear I even took my head
 
01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:10.839 align:start position:0%
turned it around to our two other
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
experts and both gave me a nod and I
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
think they're doing it right now behind
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
me as I'm
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
speaking other question representative
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
Palazo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if Government
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
places an into removal
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
procedures like what what happens then
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
is there any communication does the
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
department have a way to know that
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
immigrant is no longer legally here and
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
should be self deported or in uh in some
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
other deportation
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
procedures individuals who would be
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
subject to deportation presumably will
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
have gone through the process and were
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
denied uh being granted either Refugee
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
or other status so they would be we
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see them part of that at least
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
um unless there's some very odd
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
circumstance that we're not aware of we
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
would not see that that would be done
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
prior to entering into our our
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
system other
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing no other questions
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
you oh representative
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question gentlemen can you
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
help because it is so confusing can you
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
help describe the various categories of
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
like the legal status of a refugee um
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
versus an asy versus a resident versus
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
someone who's undocumented because I
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
think they get conflated and there's
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
terminology related to the legal status
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
of refugees that I haven't heard stated
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
yet I I would agree that in hearing the
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
testimony here that uh we were even
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
questioning what we're trying to do in
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
terms of defining uh those various
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
different categories what I did he
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
clearly was undocumented individuals I
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
heard clearly um individuals seeking to
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
becoming documented but doing it through
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
fraud uh I've heard about individuals
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
who have been granted uh Refugee status
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
um and heading their way to censorship
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
so those are at least the three
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
categories that I think I can discern
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
from the testimony but that's about the
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
best that I can do uh rather T if unless
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
there's other questions that you have
 
01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly describe the
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
process if that's what you're actually
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
asking in terms of what is a typical
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
process for an in individual who becomes
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh given a grant for Refugee status and
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
then receiving our services I think
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's what you might be asking and if
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're not I will stay here until I can
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
get it right and or until your chair
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
says enough
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
time are you
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
followup I have heard the status the
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
legal status of refugees described as
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
refugees Upon a rival have the full
 
01:08:59.309 --> 01:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
rights and all um privileges of a
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
citizen accept the right to vote and
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
then they are on a particular path
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
towards you know getting towards
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
citizenship but that is their legal
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
status which is very different from
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
other immigrants and it's part of the
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
you know infrastructure of of you know
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
the refugee act and all that I would
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
agree okay representative Weber um mine
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
is more a question of the chair but also
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
a question of uh the folks who are
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
testifying which is that I wonder I
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
think it would be very helpful and this
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
is a follow-up to representative tez's
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
Point uh but it would be very helpful
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
for me as one of those people for whom
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
the various statuses are murky because I
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't work with them all the time if
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
either the department or perhaps our
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
researcher could prepare for us a list
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
of the different statuses
 
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
um and what the implications are in
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
terms of uh benefits received and from
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
whom because there are as representative
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
TZ has pointed out any number of
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
different statuses and those of us who
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
are less knowledgeable about them tend
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
to blur the lines and it would be very
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to have some kind of list of
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
what the statuses are
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
and what what benefits and what what we
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
do for each of those categories that
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
would be very
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you representative Weber
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
that is something that we can do and
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
just as a a brief summary of that the
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
program serves folks who have sending it
 
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
along would be great and represent Weber
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
just uh we will connect uh um the
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
researcher Miss Dyer uh we actually have
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
those experts who could have come
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
prepared but this is not a day for that
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
Journey for folks to go through that
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
process no I I was hoping down the road
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
and in my email
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
box any other
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you very much
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
right there by you on this bill could
 
01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%

01:11:30.239 --> 01:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah could you pass that down
pause

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
pause
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
records thank you very
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
much no one else has signed up to
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 1347 so I'm going to close
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
1347 and open the public hearing on hb1
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
1638 FN and recognize the prime sponsor
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
Penza I saw her picking up a pink card
 
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
earlier so I assume that's on the way
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere actually she's holding it okay
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
go we could pass that up represent
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
just give it to representative Palazo
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
the pink card I mean I didn't fill it
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
out yet so okay no that's fine that's
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
fine okay that's fine or you can do it
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
after either
 
01:12:34.719 --> 01:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
after either
way

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
whoops thank you Mr chair um for the
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative uh
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
Kelly Penza straford District 19 um I
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
put this bill in uh in regards with um
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
talking to actually one constituent and
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
then uh having a meeting with um fellow
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um and just in the essence
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
of government uh kind of accountability
 
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.390 align:start position:0%
of government uh kind of accountability
and

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
transparency and but before I talk about
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
this kind of very simple bill um I I
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
would like to just give a quick story
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
about um a conversation that I had with
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
a DHHS employee in Roch Chester I met
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
her at uh just a a local little coffee
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
hole and she can't she actually uh has
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
only been in New Hampshire for a short
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
period of time and um and it was just
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
really refreshing to hear um you know
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
the the changes that are going on uh
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
within her um within her department and
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
um you know you're always going to have
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
folks in in any agency in any Department
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
in every governmental branch that are
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know you're going to have some bad
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
apples and I think this bill um helps
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
that process I think it helps um I think
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
it helps people that are in charge um
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
holding you know uh staff accountable
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
and because this woman that was from New
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
York had told me that you know this New
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is light years away from what
 
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
she was experiencing but there could
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
still be some improvements and so I had
 
01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
told her about this bill and she says I
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
think that's a fantastic idea so hearing
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
it specifically from the horse's mouth
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
um I just thought that this was uh a
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
very simple bill that could if people
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
pattern um a history of issues uh that
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
there is a process that we don't keep
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
people in the system so um or employees
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
in a system that is um already
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
completely overwhelmed and taxed and
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
burdened uh in every way form so these
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
these workers um have a lot of
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they have um um they
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
have huge tasks in front of them so I
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
just thought that this would help help
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
this process keeping good people
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
rewarding good people as well as uh you
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
know keeping people accountable that's
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you any questions
 
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.950 align:start position:0%
it thank you any questions
representative

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not mistaken I heard you said
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
that you would this was this idea came
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
out of a conversation with a
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
constituent and I'm wondering um in
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
further conversations have you found
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
this issue to be generalizable I mean is
 
01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.110 align:start position:0%
this issue to be generalizable I mean is
it

01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
like rather than one particular
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
situation have you found it to be um a
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
situation that comes up frequently and
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about um misconduct or
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
um you know failure to do the job
 
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
properly but um have have you generally
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
found that there were a lot of problems
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
with supervising um employees who are
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
not performing um adequately and
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
um whatever giving consequences or
 
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
giving the opportunity to for job
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
Improvement um so my question basically
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
is have you found this to be generally a
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
problem yeah I can't really speak to
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
that I think the point of the bill um is
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
is process and I think that this is
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
really good process that we should have
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
in place I'm going to to read you one
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
line so the review shall Encompass a
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
detailed examination of all the records
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
related to their job performance
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
including their responses to delegated
 
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
tasks for the prior 3 years if the
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
examination were reveals a pattern of
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
failure to perform their duties as
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
required the employee
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
shall the employee shall be placed on
 
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
probation and receive remedial training
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's the point like this that
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
is the most important line to me of this
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill and because I there's not a review
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
process that's seeing if someone is has
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
a pattern and I just think that this
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
could it just should be helpful I know
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
that if I was not
 
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
performing my job let's just say as a
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
legislator and you've got people that
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
are making um you know constant
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
complaints and stuff like that and
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no follow through
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's no that you know it's kind of
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
like your complaints are kind of falling
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
on deaf ears I just think that this is
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
it's good it's good to I would want to
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
know how I could improve in my job and I
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
I just think that um everybody should
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
should want this I think it's good for
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
the agency I think it's good for all of
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
us follow up thank you um so
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
I'm two follow-ups um one is really why
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
you limited this to Department of Health
 
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
and Human Services why not all of state
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
government and second of all do you um
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
do you can you tell us what the current
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
process is within DHHS when an employee
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
inadequately so
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
if in the statute it talks about what
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
the process is in a very general sense
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
and um I just wanted to make it more
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
specific so um I had a conversation uh
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
with that employee that works underneath
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
the HHS and she told me kind of what
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
happens now and this doesn't happen and
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason why that this was
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
put in this was put in like that um and
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
I just uh I wanted to focus on DHHS
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
because I I just um this bill if it was
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
overall would have been more uh will I
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
file this again um next year for another
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
agency I probably
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
will so let's just hit take down one at
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
a time representative Weber and then
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy I believe that the
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
answer to representative Shapiro's um uh
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
question has also answered I had a very
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
similar thrust so thank you thank you
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
question I it somewhat piggybacks off of
 
01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
Representative Shapiro and Weber's
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
question but my specific question is are
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
you aware that there's a and I'm not you
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
know in any organization I've been in
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's an HR department that normally
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
handles complaints and you know those
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
type of misconduct issues are you aware
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
that DHHS or other agencies does not
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
have a HR department to handle
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
these so most HR departments so if I
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
have a complaint I'm not going to an HR
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
department that that usually is if
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
you're an employee not if you're an
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
outside um um entity person that is that
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
has experienced a problem usually you're
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
going directly to
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
um you know a person at the top for
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
example I was I had contacted uh DHHS uh
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
concerning a con a constituent about a
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
um this had to do with a child care
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
issue I went directly to I I went
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
directly to a manager that manager
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
brought me um to an employ uh to the
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer for DHHS so they don't bring you
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
to an HR department that is usually
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
happens within so it's employee employee
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
um you know Superior to an employee
 
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
that's not usually a pathway for someone
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the outside going
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the
 
01:21:11.229 --> 01:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
question in regards to the issue of what
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
I call customer service is this more
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
like if someone gets disgruntled because
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
they don't get what they wish to receive
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
that's more of a customer service issue
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
than it really is to to represent
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
Murphy's issue the employee not doing
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
the job so so that how do we understand
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
how do we break this apart with somebody
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
who doesn't get what they want and they
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
consider a bad customer service versus
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
somebody who's really having a
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
problem I know I think it simply covers
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
that so it basically says right here in
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
the beginning the commissioner shall
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
direct the department to adopt the rules
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
that require all employees who have been
 
01:21:47.629 --> 01:21:47.639 align:start position:0%
found by virtue of a complaint filed in
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
their normal course so how how someone
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
that has been grieved through you know
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
the the agency they have to follow a
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
normal process so that's already in that
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
in place so it's not it it's not just a
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
um you know a customer service issue
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
because it has to then it continues to
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
have failed their it has to be proven so
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
they failed to perform their job
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
properly it goes through the normal
 
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
process that they would already be doing
 
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's just now adding
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
on okay so is there been a pattern of
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chman having
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
worked with the public for over 20
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
years and been um subject to a lot of
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
customer service issues it's very hard
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
for anyone at least for myself to
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
distinguish between somebody having
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
really poor customer service because
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't get what they want versus
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
poor customer service because the
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
employee didn't provide reasonableness
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
if you will so I just think this is kind
 
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
of a slippy slope in trying to Define
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
what customer service should be and how
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
we get to it can you help me understand
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
and how we're going to break apart poor
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
performance okay the commissioner is
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
already doing that so if I Lodge a
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
complaint let's say for example I Lodge
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
a complaint against
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf that complaint has been
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
investigated and found valid through the
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner and that person has is the
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
process has happened they've already
 
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
said that they failed to perform their
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
job properly
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
so that so this isn't a you know this
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
isn't just a complaint board and then
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
everybody it it still has to go through
 
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.669 align:start position:0%
everybody it it still has to go through
due

01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
process okay other
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I um I'm a little
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
confused by the example you provided I
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
think it was helpful to differentiate
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
that this is not an HR uh issue uh are
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
you aware of sort of what the current um
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
requirements for staff performance
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
review are and and if you're not I I'm
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
sure we'll hear from someone from the
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
Department um and then are you how does
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
this intersect with the ombudsman's
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
office which exists to uh deal with uh
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
concerns from uh people who are
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
receiving services or you know interact
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
so this isn't um I didn't I didn't
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
incorporate the omn omnibud in this
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
process so it's it's basically whatever
 
01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.110 align:start position:0%
process so it's it's basically whatever
the

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
current the current process that the
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
agency is providing in regards with um
 
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.310 align:start position:0%
agency is providing in regards with um
job

01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
performance it's adding on to look if
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
there is a pattern if there's a history
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's really um I I know what I they do
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
provide R medal training I know those
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
things that are already happening um
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's just adding in to see if there's a
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
pattern and if there is a pattern that
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
um you know three years then there
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
should be something that comes after
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
that because there could just be an if
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
you fail to perform and fail to perform
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
and fail to perform and there's
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
no yeah that that's really kind of the
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
the whole point of
 
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
this and I and I think that all of us
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
should be all of us should want um
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
should want that especially for you know
 
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
public employees uh you know everybody
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
should want that and I think about even
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
in um law
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement all of that stuff I think is
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
extremely important there has to be a a
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
process and I think this piece of the
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
process is
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
missing other
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak our attorney Rob
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
Barry and Barbara mccan from the
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
Services good morning Mr chair members
 
01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is robberry I'm
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
the general counsel to the division of
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid at the department of healthy
 
01:26:22.109 --> 01:26:22.119 align:start position:0%
and services however before that uh
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
position I was the HR attorney with the
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
HHS for over 5 years I also served two
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
years as the employee relations
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
administrator with the Department of
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
Services I'm Barbara mccan the interim
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
human resource director for Health and
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services and uh thank
 
01:26:45.629 --> 01:26:45.639 align:start position:0%
you uh so we'll Begin by um stating we
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
do not position on the uh on the bill
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
but we are concerned about it um the
 
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
primary issue we're concerned about is
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
that it creates uh some massive confus
 
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
Fusion as to the current process um
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
currently the department of
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
administrative Services through the
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
division of personnel is responsible for
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
promulgating personnel rules uh across
 
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
the entire spectrum of state
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
employment uh there is a process in
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
there for discipline it is laid out very
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
clearly you can look at peer
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rule peer 1000
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
2.04 through 08 and that'll give you the
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
entire process for letters of warnings
 
01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:26.950 align:start position:0%
entire process for letters of warnings
suspensions

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
suspensions
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
terminations uh and things of that
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
nature um so there is a process to laid
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
out in law as it stands this bill
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
essentially gives the Commissioner of
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
Health un Services the ability
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
to um usurp I guess for lack of a better
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
word div the director of the division of
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
personnel's uh Authority in terms of uh
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
promulgating rules and it serves to
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
create some massive confusion in the
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
process that's already laid out
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
that one of the um items that was
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned was that uh about performance
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
reviews so we do um under the Personnel
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
rules for the State of New Hampshire do
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
um annual performance reviews and in
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
that um there are goals set if someone
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
is underperforming and those are looked
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
at while um we also go through any kind
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
of discipline process there's a look
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
back period of five years so additional
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and any kind of pattern that might
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
show up um would be addressed during
 
01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.709 align:start position:0%
show up um would be addressed during
that

01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
period representative Shapiro and then
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
question um if I was a little bit more
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
Nimble I would have looked up those
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
rules already but uh I'm afraid I'm not
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
that Nimble and I maybe you can tell me
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
where I can find them um however I I
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
think the sponsor of this bill referred
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
to this piece of the process is missing
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
and I think she was referring
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
specifically to the part of like looking
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
back over 3 years to see if there was a
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
pattern of I don't know either
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
misbehavior or um inadequate performance
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
or I guess a variety of things and is it
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
true that this piece of the process is
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
missing or is uh or is a um pattern of
 
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
problematic performance taken into
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
account in um in job reviews um so I
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
would not agree that this pattern is not
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
taken into account um as part of my
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
duties with general counsel to HR uh I I
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuted I'd say well over 20 appeals
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
at the Personnel appeals board uh one of
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
my main concerns when considering what
 
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
sort of discipline was appropriate for
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
an employee was a pattern of behavior so
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
pattern is absolutely uh considered when
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
determining discipline uh and like uh
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
Miss can allude it to we actually go
 
01:29:58.590 --> 01:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
back five years as opposed to
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
three our representative Weber I believe
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
was next then representative Lon thank
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Speaker Mr Speaker Mr
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and U not speaker yet I don't
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
think I
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
want my apologies and thank you for
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is um
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
is I'm wondering if there isn't a
 
01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.510 align:start position:0%
is I'm wondering if there isn't a
benefit

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
to having uh the department of
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
administrative Services be the people
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
setting the overview for this rather
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
than having the
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
department uh look at it internally
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
because we have a more um uh if I'm
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
understanding the process there is a
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
more independent review and oversight
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
that would be missing if we
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
gave the department the full authority
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
to deal with these
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
issues yeah I think that's true um part
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the uh the disciplinary review
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
process when an employee is disciplined
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
they have appeal rights um they can go
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
through up to four steps depending on
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
the appeal terminations will
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
automatically go to the last step
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
actually that's a fifth step at the
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
personel appeals board um but the fourth
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
step in the informal dispute resolution
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
process is the division of personnel and
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
it's heard by the division director uh
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
who is independent from DHHS and uh will
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh determine whether the discipline
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
issued by DHHS was
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you representative Lon
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
for being here to answer questions um my
 
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
question is how can people make sure
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
that they have a complaint so that they
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
can register it because there may be a
 
01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
disconnect between people's ability to
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh to basically bring this to somebody's
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
attention and the process well so we
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
have the udman as I believe
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative tez mentioned that they
 
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
are individuals who are responsible for
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
um processing and evaluating uh citizen
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
complaints if they are concerned about
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
something they do pass it on to
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
supervisors for for further review uh
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
individuals can go through supervisors
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
they can go through uh the
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office it wasn't uncommon
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
for me when I was in the HR realm to get
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
things filtered down uh from as high up
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
as sometimes the governor's office it
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for it to happen so
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
there is a process for coming for
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
complaints being uh processed and
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated as represented Merchant was
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
referring to uh earlier sometimes it may
 
01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
be that people just don't like the
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
result of the the
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
outcome okay that seems a little complex
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
for people but I guess we have multiple
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
channels to feed in yeah there is really
 
01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
no wrong door it does get to where it
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be um people are well aware of
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
um so if it goes anywhere it's going to
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
get to the person who needs to evaluate
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
it it does happen it's very rare when
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
something gets just completely dropped
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I can't even think of an example but
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
we do have a process in
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
place representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
I have to say I enjoyed reading this
 
01:33:14.109 --> 01:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
bill because this is exactly how I rais
 
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
my children so um the part that I like
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
the most about the bill that I would
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
like you to address is on line um 11 or
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
10 of the bill where it says not only
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
you identify there's a problem um and
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
place them on probation but the part
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
where they get remedial training and it
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
says and get remedial training it's
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
implied in that bill that they are going
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
to get that and I think too often we
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
criticize people without trying to help
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
them what is the process now that you do
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
with regards to that so whenever
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
anybody's issued a um uh any discipline
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's less than termination uh they are
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
issued a performance Improvement plan or
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan uh where we put
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
in there what they need to do to avoid
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
further discipline often times that will
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
involve remedial training if it's uh
 
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
something particularly with case uh
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
review or things like that so what my
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
process was when I was the attorney and
 
01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
the employee relations administrator uh
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
assisting supervisors with determining
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
what a corrective action plan would look
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
like I would always ask what trainings
 
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
can you give somebody to to improve this
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
how do we make this employee successful
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
because um the
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of effort to go through a
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
personal appeals board um uh you know uh
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
process and we also want people to
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
succeed so we always give people plenty
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
of opportunity to succeed and if they
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
hadn't been given that you know that
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
rudimentary training or the you know the
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
talking to about what they're doing
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
wrong um we would often say you need to
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
take this extra step before we go down
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
that step you need to give them a chance
 
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
to succeed before you can pursue uh you
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
know serious discipline
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
well is that process in the rules that
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
you referred to earlier miss m wants to
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
actually add something well I wanted to
 
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
say um before an employee gets to the
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
discipline process those also any kind
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
of performance issues are identified
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
during the performance evaluations and
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
in in the supervisors will also create
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
um trainings or goals corrective actions
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
as well um early on so it's more
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
performance Improvement and before we
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
get to the discipline process
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative kushman thank you Mr
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
and taking our
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
wondering um what's measured in that
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
review um when you do the look back of
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
the fiveyear period um is there you know
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
are you looking at just procedures are
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
you receiving like I'm talking about the
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
administrative um Department a Personnel
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
I guess are they getting um are they
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
getting help in evaluating based on the
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
specific division that the person Works
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
in and the rules that and laws that
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
govern that specific department or
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
division or is it kind of just a broad
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
um you know your work's done on time
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
your reports are filed you've met your
 
01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:19.590 align:start position:0%
your reports are filed you've met your
continuing

01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
education um and you have no discipline
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
or is it very specific each department
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
works the division of personnel has
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
created uh templates that we use for
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
performance evaluation each template is
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
specific towards the job so there might
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
be a technical there might be a
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
managerial more of a support template
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
that people would use and in those
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
evaluation forms there are up to 25
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
bullet points of things that we look at
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
and there's a sliding scale of
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
below expectation to exceeds expectation
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
that the supervisors will review
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
annually with with the person in regards
 
01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
to their job description and and their
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
performance followup thank you and is
 
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
there anything in those requirements
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
that measures or um kind of audits uh
 
01:37:15.149 --> 01:37:15.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the bill it says putting
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
lives at Great risk on on line 11 and I
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
think maybe that definition needs to be
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
tightened up um my concern is with
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of the people that
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
are served by the government agencies is
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
there any audit on whether um a person
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
is uh effectively upholding the
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution and ensuring they're not
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
infringing on the the rights of the
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
people and is there any training to that
 
01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
employees well so endangering the life
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
of a uh a citizen of the state is
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
already outlined in the Personnel roles
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
is a terminable offense um so it's not
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
something that is um we don't have to go
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
through the you know the step process
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
there you if you're found to have uh
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
engaged in behavior that was potentially
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous um you can be terminated
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
immediately uh as for trainings I'm not
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
up to speed on what's going on trainings
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
wise across the entire department other
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
than your basic um you know um privacy
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
security um confidentiality
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know sexual harassment policies
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
and things like that so your standard HR
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh trainings but um I haven't been
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
engaged in that in a couple of years so
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
there could be new things that I'm not
 
01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.310 align:start position:0%
there could be new things that I'm not
aware

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
of other representative
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
Palazo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I wonder what
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
can prevent termination of Po performing
 
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
employees and for
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
example is it true that some of the CH
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
employes are
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
unionized and protected by some Union
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
agreement to L extent from being
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
terminated so the collective bargaining
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
agreement for state employees through
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
the state employees Association does not
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
Encompass discipline that is completely
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
within the realm of the Personnel rules
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh the collective bargaining agreement
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
for state employees is uh centered on
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions of employment
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy representative
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant and then representative kersman
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
question as I listened to the
 
01:39:39.589 --> 01:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
conversation about the employee being
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
bombarded by a citizen of our state what
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
protection do the employee have
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
from unil unrespectful behavior of the
 
01:39:50.669 --> 01:39:50.679 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state do they have any
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
rights or any way to protect them from
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who become so disgruntled they
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't get what they want and take it out
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
of the employees is there any way to
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
protect the employee from that behavior
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
and very very extreme circumstances and
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the last time this has
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
happened we will seek out restraining
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
orders against individuals it doesn't
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
happen very often and I can't even
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
remember the last time it happened um
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
but there is that process in place if
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but it's got to be very
 
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
very extreme Behavior not simply uh
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
disgruntled uh citizens or people who
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
are just trying to be make a nuisance of
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
themselves representative kushman thank
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I know that you
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
alluded to it and you said that there
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
are multiple channels to to Lodge a
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
complaint but say I kind of want to walk
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
through that explore it a little bit
 
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
more so say I um in receiving um you
 
01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.350 align:start position:0%
more so say I um in receiving um you
know

01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
I I think if I can say I bring in a
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
complaint to the
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman and then you know I've I've
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
received complaints personally as a
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative that fell on deaf ears
 
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
according to the people who brought them
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
to me so I'm seeing a different story
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
than what you're saying is happening
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
that all the complaints eventually end
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
up you know being
 
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
processed and then determined to be
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
founded or not
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
founded um can you walk us through that
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit like is there a phone
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
number Central phone number someone can
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
call to Lodge a complaint can you walk
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
in and file a
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
complaint well all of our uh information
 
01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
is posted online but the EMB budman's
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
number is online but you can look up my
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
my information my phone number is online
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh people can give me a call and people
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
do give me a call to talk about things
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
that are not related to my job at all
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
and what I do with that is I send it to
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
the right person and because I've worked
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
there for 10 years now I know enough
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
people to how to get it to them but when
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
it comes to employee conduct one thing
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
to remember is the results of those
 
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
investigations are not going to be
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
public they unless an individual is
 
01:42:02.669 --> 01:42:02.679 align:start position:0%
issue discipline and they appeal it to
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
the Personnel appeals board that's a
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
public process everything else is not
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
going to be public so a lot of times
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
people will hear we took appropriate
 
01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
action and sometimes that means we
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
terminated that employee but we cannot
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
tell you that because um they have not
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
appealed it so that can be not
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
satisfying um answer for people but
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
that's how it is in the Personnel rules
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's we're supposed to be confidential
 
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's also in the collective bargaining
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
agreement um and then sometimes the
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
complaints are simply just unfounded um
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's a disgruntle citizen for whatever
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
reason um and they just don't like to
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
hear that uh that answer so um you know
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
we do take complaints very very
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
seriously because we are aware of what
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
we do in in New Hampshire and what we're
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for for doing so so um you
 
01:42:58.750 --> 01:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
know I can assure you that we do um
 
01:43:00.669 --> 01:43:00.679 align:start position:0%
process complaints and take appropriate
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
action as
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessary representative
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
my question so as a followup to that is
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
that data compiled sort of in aggregate
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know deidentified manner you know we
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
had X number of complaints and you know
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
X were resolved and maybe they were
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
resolved in different ways like is that
 
01:43:24.189 --> 01:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh anywhere I don't know about
 
01:43:24.199 --> 01:43:26.669 align:start position:0%
uh anywhere I don't know about
complaints

01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
Barbara in in our office we have an
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
employee relations unit and obviously um
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
we track all the discipline processes
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
and even if they don't rise to
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
discipline if it was a complaint that's
 
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
investigated but um in regards to your
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
answer I I don't think there is a a RIS
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
unless yeah unless the udman keeps a
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
complaint um but you know HR does
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
compile the the disciplinary uh
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
processes for sure and I mean I can
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
speak from experience on this um when I
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
was hired at the department as the um
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
General Council of the Bureau of elderly
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
and Adult
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
Services um and my the HR attorney
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
position was not even in my job
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
description and I was given the position
 
01:44:13.589 --> 01:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
um I will say I spent probably 80 to 95%
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
of my time handling um employee
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
discipline um there is a lot um that
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
goes on and we do uh spend a lot of time
 
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that employees are
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
performing their jobs adequately
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
followup so as a follow up I guess just
 
01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh steming off representative kushman's
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
question I think there's this desire for
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
just having some evidence whether it's
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
at the department of personnel level or
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS level just to be able to show
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
people yes you are getting you know data
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
and aggregate you are getting complaints
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
you are managing them and you are
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
handling them and you are resolving them
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
without giving away any details just
 
01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
it's possible we could compile that but
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
I can't say for sure that we could um so
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
we might be able to do disciplinary
 
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
numbers for the Department uh to tie it
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
to a number of complaints um because
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
complaints are going to be come in all
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
shapes and size is not necessarily about
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
employees sometimes they could just be
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
complaining about a department process
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
in general that has nothing to do with
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
employees specifically so that might be
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
hard to um to show but I we can
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
definitely show an aggregate in terms of
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
um of discipline um another thing that's
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
public is the Personnel appeals board
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
has a record of all their um the current
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
appeals going on so you can see there's
 
01:45:36.669 --> 01:45:36.679 align:start position:0%
quite a few probably I haven't looked in
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
a while but there there was one point in
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
my life where I was probably the most
 
01:45:43.629 --> 01:45:43.639 align:start position:0%
common attorney up at the uh at the
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
personel felds
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
board representative Leon and then
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative kosman uh thank you Mr
 
01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking another
 
01:45:53.589 --> 01:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
question um so my my question is I mean
 
01:45:56.589 --> 01:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
we we've unfortunately seen um a case
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
that I think we all hope had been
 
01:45:59.589 --> 01:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
handled differently and that Harmony was
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
still here if um there were complaints
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
that people made that they weren't sure
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
if it was followed up on do do people
 
01:46:07.589 --> 01:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
report that they had reported something
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
that then wasn't followed up on and how
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
would that be handled because we want to
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that that everything we can
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
pursue whether or not a complaint was
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
ignored and not processed by an employee
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
or something else is sort of handled in
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
this process because I understand you're
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
trying to have a seeve where everything
 
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
is coming from through and those with
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
with Merit follow through but how do we
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that the plates are handled
 
01:46:32.109 --> 01:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
appropriately by employees so that
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
we we don't potentially miss um this
 
01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
happening to somebody else are you
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
asking how the legislature does that no
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
I'm asking how how the department of
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
personnel follows up to make sure that
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
people are actually appropriately
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
recording complaints that are coming
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
through um if somebody's worried about a
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
child I can't speak to what the division
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
of personnel does because it's a
 
01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
different agency it's part of the
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
administrative Services um all I can
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
speak to is what um HHS does and um we
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
stand by the fact that we process
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
complaints appropriately and we take
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate action based on what the
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
complaint is and what we can verify okay
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
and so sorry followup follow up um and
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
so even if you can't verify something
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
you have a way that you know that you
 
01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
got a report you got a record you
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
weren't able to verify it so that's
 
01:47:22.109 --> 01:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
something that could be followed up if
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
there is an employee who tends to find
 
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
certain cases
 
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
non-verified so if an employee is put
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
under investigation and there is no
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
action taken what we do is we put
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
together a a letter that we provide to
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
the employee saying that you know you
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
were under investigation no further
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
action has been taken but that's not
 
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
placed in their personnel file because
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to place in their
 
01:47:48.669 --> 01:47:48.679 align:start position:0%
personnel file for the Personnel rules
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
we can only put discipline in there okay
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
I think I might try and follow up on you
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
to get a better understanding of the
 
01:47:58.510 --> 01:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
process okay representative
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
kushman I'm also set thank you thank you
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative palazov thank you Mr
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
question so the bill is written is
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
talking about five steps and I wonder
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
how the steps currently lie between D
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
HHS and division of personnel so I'm
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
talking about First Step Job review
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
Second Step casee review third step
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
probation fourth remedial training and
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
fifth termination so
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
currently is is it all directed by
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
division of personnel or are some of
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
those steps would be directed by U uh
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
Administration in DS could you explain
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
so the agency for which the employee
 
01:48:49.229 --> 01:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
works is going to handle the
 
01:48:49.239 --> 01:48:50.629 align:start position:0%
works is going to handle the
disciplinary

01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
investigation um administra Services
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
only comes into it if through the appeal
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
process and to maintain the individual's
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
personnel file so if their discipline is
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
issued um the um the document is
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
provided to administrative services for
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
place in to place in their file but
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
everything else is going to be handled
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
at the agency level not just DHHS but
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
safety Corrections whoever the agency
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
is other
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
could somebody give me the blue sheet uh
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
Christina perhaps or oh you have another
 
01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
Christina perhaps or oh you have another
another

01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
card also signed up to speak is Bob blaz
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
Dell uh from the New Hampshire state
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee um as stated earlier um for
 
01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Bob blazel
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
representing the state employees
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
Association of New
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I took a look at this bill
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't I was I wasn't quite sure
 
01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
um what the what the goal was here um so
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
I wanted to come in and and and listen
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
to the to the sponsor and I wasn't quite
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
sure I was going to speak but based on
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
what I've I've heard so far U I think
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make just a few comments if
 
01:50:23.599 --> 01:50:25.870 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make just a few comments if
I

01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.390 align:start position:0%
 
may

01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
um on line four it refers to by by
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
virtue of of
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
complaint uh I guess uh one of the
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
concerns might be here is what what
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
constitutes a
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
complaint um is it external is it
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
internal um we it's it's not uh
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily made made clear there um I
 
01:50:50.669 --> 01:50:50.679 align:start position:0%
did want to bring to the committee's
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
attention that on line 10 where it talks
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
about placing an employee on on
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
probation um this this would be in
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
direct um conflict with RSA 273 A1 U
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
where it states that the probationary
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
period um cannot exceed a year I don't
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
believe there's a mechanism to put um an
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
existing employee that's already
 
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
completed their probationary Year back
 
01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:18.310 align:start position:0%
completed their probationary Year back
on

01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
probation uh so that's um as I think one
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
of the previous speakers me mentioned
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
this uh this I think the words were
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
massive confusion um I would I would
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
tend to agree with with
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
that um line 10 it's we're talking
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me line 12 we're we're um talking
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
terminated the Personnel
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
rules provide for a currently they
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
provide for a totality of circumstances
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
test to determine the appropriate level
 
01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:54.790 align:start position:0%
test to determine the appropriate level
of

01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
discipline um in in any given situation
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
um as is stated in the bill um shall be
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
terminated that that language
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
essentially removes any balancing test
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
um any ability to to consider the length
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
of employment past performance um or um
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
any other disciplinary options that are
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
table um I will refer you
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
to person rules uh 102 period
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%

01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
3 um excuse me 03 um section c excuse me
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
um there was I believe the the sponsor
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
was talking about um we need to get back
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
at um past
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
performance um I'm just going to read
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
this to you it's very very quick um the
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
employees past record of performance and
 
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
discipline including whether or not the
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
employee has been disciplined in the
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
past um for the same or similar offense
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's already in in the current
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
Personnel rules so I'm I'm I am I guess
 
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
at a loss um I'm I'm looking at at these
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
rules and I'm I'm happy Mr chairman to
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
leave um these Personnel rules with you
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
um if it's if it's helpful for the
 
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
committee um and I could be mistaken um
 
01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:19.719 align:start position:0%
but I I I think I may have heard the
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor mention that that she had um
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
conferred with some stakeholders um as
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
every legislative comes across my desk
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
um for the state employees I'm their
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
senior lobbyist um I've I've never been
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
consulted um regarding this I'm happy to
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
have more
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
conversations um you email those
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
personnels to all the members of the
 
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
committee oh oh oh okay all right thank
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
you okay never mind um so that's that's
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
um just want to make sure I covered
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
everything uh yeah that's just that's my
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts for the day um if I can try and
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%

01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
certainly will do so thank you
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you providing all of
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
this information um my the one thing
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
that really caught my attention was that
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
you said that there could be mitigating
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
factors to not terminate an employee
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
with a pattern of putting lives at Great
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
risk could you help me understand how
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
there could be mitigating factors if
 
01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
someone has a history of putting lives
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry did you say that I said
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
something yes you called out
 
01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:31.639 align:start position:0%
online um you called out on line 11 in
 
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
the event that an employee has a pattern
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
of putting lives at Great risk the
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
employee shall be terminated um I'm not
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
sure if you hadn't closely read before
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
that that comma saying that it's only
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
for those employees who have placed
 
01:54:45.069 --> 01:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
lives at Great risk um because I
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
understand that you already have
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
policies around termination um but I'm
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
trying and you spoke to mitigating
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
factors I'm just trying to understand if
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
there could be a mitigating factor to
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
having a pattern of putting lives at
 
01:54:55.719 --> 01:54:57.709 align:start position:0%
having a pattern of putting lives at
Great

01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
Great
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
risk I am I'm not going to try and
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
pretend to to speak for the agency
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
whether it be um Health and Human
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
Services or any other agency um I would
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
very much like to believe that if there
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
was an existing pattern um already about
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
putting lives at risk that that matter
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
would be addressed in a quick and quick
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
manner thank you
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%

01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
question on which RSA were yeah could
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
you uh repeat the RSA that was in the
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
that RSA
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
273- a colon
 
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
1 and that would be in Roman numeral 9
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
section D where it says no employee
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
shall be determined to be in a
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%

second representative kofalt seconds
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative um this has been passed
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
around this is an amendment um that
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
removes um an old pilot program from one
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
of the charges of the commission and it
 
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
also um makes it so that the the report
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
detailing the data sharing between
 
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
between de and DHHS only have have to
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
happen annually instead of at a minimum
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
that was what a request from the
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
Department um I drafted this amendment
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with uh the prime sponsor
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
Nancy Murphy um I am a member of the
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
commission I think it does good work I
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
think that this little bit of
 
02:07:40.589 --> 02:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
housekeeping while we're here is a good

02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
02026 so
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
02026 I'm thinking this is the right
 
02:11:39.629 --> 02:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
number to come this
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
way that's too many digits sorry there
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
there are two different amendments to
 
02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
this bill they're both complimentary
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
they catch different things it is 0
 
02:11:53.470 --> 02:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
zero so
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
0206 is the one we're discussing correct
 
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
but the one we have is the other one
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's coming through this way we'll do
 
02:12:04.189 --> 02:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
the two of them so this um so to speak
 
02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
to this amendment um the first section
 
02:12:08.669 --> 02:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
um I prepared this with representative
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh the first one catches the word
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
on on it says with instead of within 21
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
days the other one is the same one that
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro caught that it
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
should be 2024 not
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
2023 um I believe he can speak to his
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment after we do that but the two
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
of them are
 
02:12:28.589 --> 02:12:28.599 align:start position:0%
complimentary I'm sorry I I don't have
 
02:12:31.149 --> 02:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
the paper yet and I have completely
 
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
gotten garbled as to what we're voting
 
02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
on right now can can you wait till we
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
get the amendment in front of us and
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
then explain it that would be really
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah thank you well we'll give
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
them I'm a visual learner I'm perfectly
 
02:12:44.719 --> 02:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
them I'm a visual learner I'm perfectly
happy

02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
happy
 
02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
to read while you're explaining I just
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
need it in front of
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
me who was second on the bill uh
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero I believe
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.830 --> 02:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
you just my own clarification we are on
 
02:13:06.669 --> 02:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
0206 yes and once I see that the
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
amendment is in everybody's hands I'll
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
tell you exactly where where it is I
 
02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate yes they were pretty simple
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
so I figured it would be all right to
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
mention it
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
twice um those ones can go around as
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
well um well we'll do it just one second
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
um so if you look on line 10 um that in
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
the original bill says with not within
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that it reads reported to the
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
department within the prior 21 days
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
instead of reported to the department
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the 20 prior 21 days and then the
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
other change um in 17 on Lane 17 is
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
changing it to 2024 instead of
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
2023 just simple clerical changes thank
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:59.549 align:start position:0%

02:15:42.189 --> 02:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
d816h to House Bill 1231 thank you is
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
there second I'll second representative
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
Le on seconds representative chaparo do
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion yes um
 
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
when Dr Dr Jerry kerk testified he um
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
informed us that the medical oversight
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
board was in favor of this homegrown
 
02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
legislation but he did point out one
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
problem and that is on page five lines
 
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
about it basically talks about who would
 
02:16:21.069 --> 02:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
be precluded from prosecution for
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
possession and it includes people who
 
02:16:28.030 --> 02:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
are not were kind of far along in their
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
approval of having a qualified condition
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
but not fully um fully qualified and so
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
um we just thought that that was too
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
confusing people who were in that
 
02:16:42.110 --> 02:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
situation could wait um and um it
 
02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
created an enforcement um confusion that
 
02:16:49.629 --> 02:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in there so um Amendment
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
0816 um just does away with um section
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
D it also it also on the top it also
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
catches the same date um change that was
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
already we already passed in the
 
02:17:03.439 --> 02:17:04.669 align:start position:0%
already we already passed in the
previous

one there's no objection we'll put it no
 
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's just the amendment I always do
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
that don't
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
I okay representative Shapiro do you
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
have another
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
motion UT pass is amended order pass is
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
amended I move order pass is amended on
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1231 not second and
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative Le on seconds any further
 
02:18:48.629 --> 02:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
discussion representative uh Merchant
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
more for clarification when we say as
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
amended since there's two amendments we
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
have to be sure we have both
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
there representative Weber what will
 
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
happen is that OS will take the two
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
amendments given that they are in
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
completely different sections and they
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
will create a committee amendment that
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
will have a different amendment number
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
but it will be created of both of these
 
02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
and we should of course check that when
 
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
the calendar comes out but that's that's
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
what happens when we have two of these
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nagel thank you
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'm I'm going to oppose
 
02:19:26.509 --> 02:19:26.519 align:start position:0%
this for the exact same reasons that I
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
opposed it last year um I also am on the
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic commission or cannabis
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
oversight commission and I was the one
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
person who voted against this there as
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
well um this is all about cost and
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
access which I totally get the system of
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers that we've
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
created is inefficient it doesn't work
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
it can be a lot better than it is but I
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
do think it's the best mechanism to
 
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
solve the problem um having toured
 
02:19:57.309 --> 02:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
multiple um cultivation centers I
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
realize the complexity that goes into
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
making a reliable product and if you're
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to have a medicinal product it
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be reliable we found out from
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
not only testimony but I'm talking to
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
the folks there that for an individual
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
to grow this at home the likelihood that
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to create a
 
02:20:16.590 --> 02:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
reliable product is extremely expensive
 
02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
and extremely unlikely so very few
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
people are going to do this anyways
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
what I would really like to see us do is
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
instead of going down this road is try
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
to reform the ATC um um um process and
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
get more centers out closer to people
 
02:20:37.230 --> 02:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
than we have right now um also to get
 
02:20:39.630 --> 02:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
rid of the nonprofit status to stop
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
making them responsible for the entire
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
cost of the program because that's what
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
makes the prices so high and start to
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
look at programs around us and the
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
states around us to see how they do it
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
so that we can mimic them to make it
 
02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
more cost effective than it is um but
 
02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm going to vote against
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
it any other discussion representative
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
Missour yes thank you um for the same
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
reasons I'll be opposing it as well I am
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
not against um therapeutic cannabis use
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
but I did hear we did hear from law
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and their oversight of this
 
02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
they said would be very difficult and
 
02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
challenging and I'm want to listen to
 
02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
that and I have some constituents who
 
02:21:22.030 --> 02:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
are not super comfortable with this so
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
for those reasons just for this one um
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to oppose it sure
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:21:31.630 --> 02:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
Merchant I hear about the law
 
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think law enforcement had
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
a real challenge specifically with page
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
five lines 13 through 18 since those
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
have been deleted I think the issue
 
02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
about enforcement becomes less
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
problematic and therefore I'll support
 
02:21:48.429 --> 02:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
the bill representative Nal did you have
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
your hand up I I did and I I think one
 
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
of there's two other issues that I
 
02:21:54.270 --> 02:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise number one is I want to
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize that we're talking about
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis as an ingested smoked plant um
 
02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
um there are actually THC and CBD
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
formulations that are FD approve FDA
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
approved and they are scheduled three so
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
it's not like people don't have access
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
to this already the other concern that's
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
been raised at the State Health
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
assessment meetings as well as at this
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
meeting as well as and this is my pun
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
for the day is that we do have a budding
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
problem with with um with cannabis use
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
disorder I mean it it's a big
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
unrecognized problem and and um if you
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
look back to the early 1900s why we've
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
created cannabis and opioid legislation
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
in the first place was it was a national
 
02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
security issue that we were seeing a
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
problems with addictions to both and we
 
02:22:40.750 --> 02:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have a stable force of young
 
02:22:43.389 --> 02:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
people to work to support to secure our
 
02:22:44.910 --> 02:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
country and things like that that was
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
the impetus for create those bills in
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
the first place and what's very
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
concerning is we're seeing between fenil
 
02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis other things like that the same
 
02:22:55.070 --> 02:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
thing again I just see these things as
 
02:22:57.389 --> 02:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
slippery slopes that are taking us down
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
of questionable Road other
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
discussion say no other discussion
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
motion motion is out to pass is amended
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
02:23:11.309 --> 02:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
1231 representative Lon yes
 
02:23:13.630 --> 02:23:13.640 align:start position:0%

02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
chairman although the intent of this
 
02:26:52.269 --> 02:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
bill initially back in 2017 was well
 
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
intended after listening to a lot of
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
testimony took from the Board of
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and their lack of documentation
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
this has actually done anything to
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
reduce an error or show a reduction in
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
error and so forth
 
02:27:08.670 --> 02:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
Etc and recognizing that this is a best
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
practice really not something should be
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
Quantified in statute um we looked at
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
other professions uh they don't have
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
something comparable to this it's my
 
02:27:19.469 --> 02:27:19.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation to this committee that is
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
signed to repeal the Bill appeal the RSA
 
02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
to uh let us get back to best practice
 
02:27:27.269 --> 02:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
and not put best practice into the
 
02:27:30.510 --> 02:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
statute any other
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr chair oh yes
 
02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
representative Missour I just have a
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
quick question so I was subbing in a
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
committee the other day and they it was
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
brought up that if there was an
 
02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that everyone there was no big
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
controversy and that everyone was going
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
to be voting on they could go straight
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
to otpa no no because they and never
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
heard that well did
 
02:27:58.190 --> 02:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
more uh I I do believe it can be a show
 
02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
of hands when it's not controversial uh
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
but it does need to be voted
 
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
on well let's let's unless it's a strong
 
02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
objection I think we should do the rooll
 
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
call represent much appreciate I think
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%

this morning um and the next bill up is
 
03:43:51.790 --> 03:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
a HB
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
1318 uh do I have a motion on that I
 
03:43:57.710 --> 03:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that I handed out okay
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nel oh and I'd like
 
03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
to make a motion um that we uh ought to
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.359 --> 03:44:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
2024-25

03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
2024-25
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
03:44:14.550 --> 03:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
1318 do I have a second second
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant seconds
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel do you want to
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion I will be as
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
succinct as possible um so just as a a
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
background um most of you heard the
 
03:44:27.389 --> 03:44:27.399 align:start position:0%
original discussion on this but there's
 
03:44:29.590 --> 03:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
been a problem in balancing the needs of
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
people in pain and people with addiction
 
03:44:34.030 --> 03:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to opioids for over 120
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
years and we've never managed to hit The
 
03:44:39.149 --> 03:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot since the Pol public policies
 
03:44:41.670 --> 03:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
of 2016 we've really gone the wrong
 
03:44:44.110 --> 03:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
direction in terms of tilting things in
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
favor of people with a addiction and
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
harming people with pain um the opioid
 
03:44:51.149 --> 03:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
abatement um trust funds that were
 
03:44:53.469 --> 03:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
created unfortunately exacerbate that
 
03:44:55.550 --> 03:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
dramatically by causing a substantial
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
redistribution of wealth from one group
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
to another without um acknowledging the
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
needs of people in pain so the whole
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill was to actually try
 
03:45:08.429 --> 03:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
to bring the system back into balance
 
03:45:10.349 --> 03:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
what was exciting about the discussion
 
03:45:13.750 --> 03:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we had with attorney um petti was
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
that it brought us together to sit down
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
chat about this in a lot greater detail
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
his concern was that anything that we do
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
has to be opioid sparing so these
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
amendments are are modified to try to
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
preserve his concerns um anyways with
 
03:45:31.710 --> 03:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
that said I'm going to go there's two uh
 
03:45:35.149 --> 03:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
specific numbers number 19 and number 18
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
both have been one more amended than the
 
03:45:41.189 --> 03:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
other one um and number 19 the only
 
03:45:43.149 --> 03:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
change I made and that was acknowledging
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
some people's concerns on the opio
 
03:45:46.870 --> 03:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
abatement commission that they didn't
 
03:45:48.429 --> 03:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
understand what public and non-public
 
03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
Services meant and I didn't either um so
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
I just removed those words that's the
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
only change in 19 um the reason why we
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
have number 19 is that everybody is
 
03:46:00.429 --> 03:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
saying well you don't need to prescribe
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
opioids you can give them all these
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
other services that we provide them no
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
access to the point of 19 was to create
 
03:46:08.750 --> 03:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
novel programs such as what we created
 
03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:09.710 align:start position:0%
novel programs such as what we created
in

03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
h66 that we can put together
 
03:46:13.750 --> 03:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
costeffective integrative care to be
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
opioid sparing and and give people
 
03:46:17.309 --> 03:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
access to other types of care when
 
03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
they're in pain um number 18 the only
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
change that I made in number 18 was to
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
be very specific about what kind of
 
03:46:29.309 --> 03:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
programs could be used um as I stated on
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh original testimony we have a huge
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
problem with what are called opioid
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
refugees people that were doing very
 
03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
well in opioid therapy but are being
 
03:46:39.269 --> 03:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
denied access to care and being subject
 
03:46:39.279 --> 03:46:40.189 align:start position:0%
denied access to care and being subject
to

03:46:40.189 --> 03:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:46:42.790 --> 03:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
non-consensual dose reductions
 
03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
detoxifications or outright abandoned
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
and they have nowhere to go this is like
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
a national humongous problem that we're
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
trying to solve and we have no homes for
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
them so what I did or what I added to
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
this um and I ran up by attorney
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
buffetti was that we created a support
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
Med medication assisted uh treatment
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
type Services which I'd be happy to
 
03:47:03.710 --> 03:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
explain in Greater depth if anybody
 
03:47:06.429 --> 03:47:06.439 align:start position:0%
wishes U so we'd be very specific about
 
03:47:08.349 --> 03:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
what kind of programs that we could
 
03:47:11.189 --> 03:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
develop um to give these people a home
 
03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
to go to a safe haven if you will after
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
they've been abandoned because right now
 
03:47:17.790 --> 03:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have anywhere to
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
go representative
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
Weber I was just going to state that my
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill was the um
 
03:47:29.790 --> 03:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
interface with the settlement agreement
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
and uh with the involvement of Mr buetti
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the um amendments that have been
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
made I'm much more comfortable so I
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
would thank you for that I I did want to
 
03:47:43.229 --> 03:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
say also that what I tried really hard
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
to do with both of these amendments is
 
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
to make them number one
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based which they are mat
 
03:47:51.630 --> 03:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
programs have like Decades of evidence
 
03:47:54.189 --> 03:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
to support them uh integrative care
 
03:47:56.910 --> 03:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
plans have Decades of exper of uh
 
03:47:58.590 --> 03:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
evidencebased and the other thing is
 
03:48:00.349 --> 03:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
these are both consistent with Schedule

E of the settlement funds and and we've
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
discussed this also in the opioid
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
abatement commission and there's
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%

representative
 
03:48:13.229 --> 03:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant I want to say thank you to
 
03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nel for uh the amendment
 
03:48:19.149 --> 03:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
I think it does in my opinion two things
 
03:48:21.309 --> 03:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
which I talked about before my analogy
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
with the bathtub it deals with
 
03:48:25.870 --> 03:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment programs
 
03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
to help people who need to be treated
 
03:48:30.429 --> 03:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
who have an addiction it helps in that
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
Arena which is what I call draining the
 
03:48:33.910 --> 03:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
bathtub but at the same time it does
 
03:48:36.750 --> 03:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
talk about trying to find under section
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
19 line 14 ways to treat patients with
 
03:48:43.389 --> 03:48:43.399 align:start position:0%
nonopiate treatment Alternatives so I
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
think in a lot of ways this tackles
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
concern I had we're not just trying to
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
empty the bathtub but we're trying to
 
03:48:50.670 --> 03:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
avoid filling it at the same time
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
therefore I'll support it thank you
 
03:48:53.560 --> 03:48:55.429 align:start position:0%
therefore I'll support it thank you

03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
palaza my my initial concern with this
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill if was if the app abatement is a
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
proper place uh for this measures but uh
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy with the explanation that we
 
03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
need br bring back uh system into
 
03:50:50.590 --> 03:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
balance and we need to respect the need
 
03:50:52.990 --> 03:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
of patients who give informed consent
 
03:50:54.309 --> 03:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
for pain
 
03:50:57.630 --> 03:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
management uh and uh I think this bill
 
03:51:00.910 --> 03:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
helps us bring back to risk benefit
 
03:51:03.750 --> 03:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
analysis and best practices so I will
 
03:51:07.710 --> 03:51:07.720 align:start position:0%

03:53:08.710 --> 03:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
so while that's being handed out I'd
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion of ought to pass
 
03:53:15.830 --> 03:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.840 --> 03:53:16.910 align:start position:0%
 
a

03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
second representative Le on
 
03:53:21.550 --> 03:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
seconds do you wish to speak to your
 
03:53:24.750 --> 03:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chair um
 
03:53:28.830 --> 03:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
so this amendment removes the first two
 
03:53:30.870 --> 03:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
paragraphs of the original Bill and
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
keeps the third paragraph in its
 
03:53:38.910 --> 03:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
entirety I don't think there was enough
 
03:53:43.389 --> 03:53:43.399 align:start position:0%
support for the original bill as is um
 
03:53:45.389 --> 03:53:45.399 align:start position:0%
really at all I think the I I know
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
personally I would not have been able to
 
03:53:50.149 --> 03:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
support the original bill um I don't
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
like the idea of compelling doctors
 
03:53:54.149 --> 03:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
against their conscience to either
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
perform an operation or to even be
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
forced to do the leg work and find um
 
03:54:03.389 --> 03:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
find out somebody who would perform the
 
03:54:05.070 --> 03:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
operation for the patient I think the
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
patient can do that on their own um this
 
03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment does keep I think a
 
03:54:13.870 --> 03:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
really good part of the bill which is
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
basically saying that if somebody does
 
03:54:18.070 --> 03:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
choose to get sterilized they don't get
 
03:54:19.950 --> 03:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
to later have regrets and then sue the
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
doctor because oops I can't have
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
children um I believe in treating adults
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
like adults and you have to be willing
 
03:54:29.149 --> 03:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
to take the consequences of your actions
 
03:54:31.469 --> 03:54:31.479 align:start position:0%
when you make these decisions so this
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
still requires a patient to sign a
 
03:54:34.349 --> 03:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
waiver and all that stuff they know what
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're getting into um the sponsor of
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I think one of her main
 
03:54:42.510 --> 03:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
contentions was that a lot of doctors
 
03:54:45.229 --> 03:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
aren't willing to perform sterilization
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
specifically uh for women because out of
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
some sort of like paternalistic ideas I
 
03:54:53.630 --> 03:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
don't really see it that way um I I tend
 
03:54:55.309 --> 03:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
to think that most doctors are just
 
03:54:58.309 --> 03:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
afraid of getting sued after the fact
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh we don't have any
 
03:55:04.110 --> 03:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
doctors that testified to explain why
 
03:55:06.269 --> 03:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
they were unwilling to do these
 
03:55:08.149 --> 03:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
procedures so we can only speculate
 
03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's my speculation is they're just
 
03:55:11.550 --> 03:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
afraid of getting sued and and this
 
03:55:13.469 --> 03:55:13.479 align:start position:0%
really helps protect them this way
 
03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
adults can be adult they can make
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
decisions uh concerning their bodies and
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh and if they later have regrets that's
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
very unfortunate but they they signed
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
the waiver you know so this way doctors
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
can do it without fear so other
 
03:55:32.110 --> 03:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lon um thank
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and I want to thank
 
03:55:35.229 --> 03:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
representative King for bringing this
 
03:55:37.750 --> 03:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um I I think that the idea of
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
a doctor not performing an otherwise
 
03:55:41.790 --> 03:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
medically necessary procedure because
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about the person's
 
03:55:44.790 --> 03:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
future repr
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
reproductive plans is a problem I really
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
would like to have a way that we could
 
03:55:51.149 --> 03:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
have figured out how to get Section A to
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
work but when I was I I don't think that
 
03:55:54.670 --> 03:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that we were going to
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
be able to come to any sort of language
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
on how to do that and I think that um
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
the effort the representative King has
 
03:56:03.750 --> 03:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
in this to basically make it clear that
 
03:56:06.030 --> 03:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
somebody can't sue for that reason um
 
03:56:07.469 --> 03:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll alleviate all those
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
concerns from doctors that are otherwise
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
not providing care that is warranted um
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
so you know I'd like to see a little bit
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
more on um somebody who's being denied
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh treatment for severe endometriosis
 
03:56:20.830 --> 03:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
because of concerns about the
 
03:56:22.990 --> 03:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive capacity but I think that
 
03:56:24.830 --> 03:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that I think we'll
 
03:56:25.950 --> 03:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
actually be able to do something
 
03:56:27.550 --> 03:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
constructive for the people of New
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by passing this so I think
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
that um while well maybe I'd like to
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
take more I think that this is a really
 
03:56:34.269 --> 03:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
good path forward and I hope everybody
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
can support this other discussion
 
03:56:37.159 --> 03:56:39.189 align:start position:0%
can support this other discussion
representative

03:56:39.189 --> 03:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:41.630 --> 03:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much well I'm very
 
03:56:43.630 --> 03:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
much in favor of the amendment and I
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank repres representative King for
 
03:56:47.030 --> 03:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
bringing it because I think it solves a
 
03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
number of really thorny issues and I too
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
want to say that um you know we had very
 
03:56:56.469 --> 03:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony about people who
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
underwent experiences where where people
 
03:57:02.149 --> 03:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
were incredibly judgmental and
 
03:57:04.990 --> 03:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
Incredibly condescending about people's
 
03:57:08.830 --> 03:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
um decisions and and also about their me
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
the actual medical care um I'm still in
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
two minds of about whether I'm going to
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
vote for the underlying bill or not
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
because I have a conceptual problem
 
03:57:25.710 --> 03:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
placing individual medical procedures in
 
03:57:27.429 --> 03:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
the patients Bill of
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
Rights um that doesn't seem to me to be
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
the right place for it but um so I
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
haven't decided how I'm voting on the
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but I I do see this is a
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
as a definite step in the right
 
03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
direction and I appreciate the approach
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy and then
 
03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero thank you Mr
 
03:57:49.590 --> 03:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um one one of my questions is
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
to representative King as to why um we
 
03:57:56.510 --> 03:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
would not just eliminate um in the
 
03:57:58.149 --> 03:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph treatment against medical
 
03:58:00.790 --> 03:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
advice so whether it's against medical
 
03:58:02.910 --> 03:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
advice or not and somebody has a
 
03:58:05.349 --> 03:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
sterilization procedure they should
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
probably not be held liable if down the
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
road they realize they they're infered
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
so my question is do we really need that
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
against medical advice in there um and
 
03:58:19.790 --> 03:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
then as to the original Bill and its
 
03:58:23.149 --> 03:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
intent I I can't assign intent to
 
03:58:26.149 --> 03:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
whatever any provider has uh determined
 
03:58:27.550 --> 03:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
was the right course of action for the
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
treatment of a patient so I won't even
 
03:58:32.429 --> 03:58:32.439 align:start position:0%
try to go there or infer any intent but
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
when you ask a surgeon to do a procedure
 
03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
that they don't feel as indicated or for
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that's the wrong surgeon
 
03:58:41.429 --> 03:58:41.439 align:start position:0%
for you you do not want that surgeon
 
03:58:43.469 --> 03:58:43.479 align:start position:0%
operating on you so so let me give you a
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
concrete example example outside of
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
obstetric in another specially that
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
begins with o Orthopedics if you have a
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
patient that has a BMI of say 50 or 60
 
03:58:56.189 --> 03:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
so they are entire they're very large
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
they have diabetes whatever it is any
 
03:59:00.030 --> 03:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
comorbidity or just a BMI that's very
 
03:59:02.149 --> 03:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
hard and they have an underlying
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of arthritis in the knee it's
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
oftentimes not the proper course of
 
03:59:09.670 --> 03:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
action to do a total replacement on that
 
03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
patient there is huge increased risk
 
03:59:14.910 --> 03:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
associated with that so language to me
 
03:59:17.030 --> 03:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that patients may have an indication
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
to have a procedure but the physician or
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
the provider's judgment is such that
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
they don't think is the most appropriate
 
03:59:25.870 --> 03:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
course of action for you and I'm not
 
03:59:27.710 --> 03:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
trying and I won't you know you can say
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
I don't like big heavy people but I you
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
know in your heart that they're doomed
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
to have a failure so I I just can't
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
assume or assign intent for any
 
03:59:41.710 --> 03:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
providers that we have heard from um in
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
prior testimony so um again I'm not
 
03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
convinced as how I'll go with the um
 
03:59:49.229 --> 03:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh but I do want to ask
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
you about should we even have treatment
 
03:59:53.110 --> 03:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
against medical advice and just be all
 
03:59:56.149 --> 03:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
inclusive about anybody that has a
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
sterilization procedure be absolved of
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
any potential uh risk or liability if
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
they were properly in uh informed of
 
04:00:05.710 --> 04:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
their risk
 
04:00:08.149 --> 04:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
involved would to answer sure uh thank
 
04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
you for the question um so your second
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
part had to do with um
 
04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
forgotten was the second part the first
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
part was about the St the should that
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
part be in there and then the second
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
04:00:30.269 --> 04:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
yes I I definitely I definitely agree
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
with you there the um um doctors
 
04:00:34.630 --> 04:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be forced to do anything and
 
04:00:37.030 --> 04:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't this with the remaining
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
like the remaining bill doesn't require
 
04:00:41.469 --> 04:00:41.479 align:start position:0%
them to do anything so if if they do
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
think the BMI is too high in a
 
04:00:44.750 --> 04:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy for for example would be too
 
04:00:46.590 --> 04:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous they have every right to opt
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
out and this bill would not force them
 
04:00:50.830 --> 04:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
to do anything um the the sterilization
 
04:00:53.149 --> 04:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
treatment against medical device to me
 
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
that just sounds like if there is a
 
04:00:56.990 --> 04:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
doctor that is willing to perform a
 
04:00:59.030 --> 04:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy on somebody who does have
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
in their opinion too high of a BMI um
 
04:01:02.990 --> 04:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
that it just protects them against
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
lawsuit later as long as the patient has
 
04:01:08.149 --> 04:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
been well informed of all the risks of
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
of doing so
 
04:01:11.870 --> 04:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
so representative Shapiro and then
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
um I agree with much of what has been
 
04:01:22.349 --> 04:01:22.359 align:start position:0%
said um in terms of how compelling the
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor story was and wishing we could
 
04:01:27.149 --> 04:01:27.159 align:start position:0%
do something about that I didn't feel
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
quite the same as about some of the
 
04:01:32.149 --> 04:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
other people who were talking about
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
feeling like they were discriminated or
 
04:01:35.710 --> 04:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
made to be self-conscious about getting
 
04:01:40.030 --> 04:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
vasectomies but the the major sponsor I
 
04:01:42.510 --> 04:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
felt was very compelling and I can't
 
04:01:44.030 --> 04:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
really figure out what we should do
 
04:01:45.870 --> 04:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
about that but it doesn't seem like we
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:01:50.149 --> 04:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
solution in terms of the um Amendment
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
itself that you're
 
04:01:55.990 --> 04:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
bringing I totally agree with the
 
04:01:58.990 --> 04:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
sentiment um but to use your terminology
 
04:02:01.469 --> 04:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
why are we adding more code rather than
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
less code and why why is this really
 
04:02:07.309 --> 04:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
necessary because this what what you're
 
04:02:09.309 --> 04:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
describing is true of any medical
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
procedure that somebody can sue but
 
04:02:15.070 --> 04:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
someone has to prove
 
04:02:17.670 --> 04:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
that there was some kind of misconduct
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
or you know in I don't know what the
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
terminology misconduct or wrongdoing um
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
so why should we why should we put this
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
one in statute as opposed to just um
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
figuring that the same process that
 
04:02:36.429 --> 04:02:36.439 align:start position:0%
applies to hand surgery or knee surgery
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
or any other medical procedure would
 
04:02:43.149 --> 04:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
apply representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I know a little bit about hips
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
and knees probably not on the putting
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
them inside as much as Dr Murphy but I
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
do about the approval the um
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and the entire
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process of them um in that
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
situation implanting a knee and somebody
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
with a BMI of 50 there's clinical data
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
showing that there actually are adverse
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes by doing that um I I think that
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to change this to remove that
 
04:03:10.030 --> 04:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
against medical advice and give this
 
04:03:12.429 --> 04:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
protection I recognize that it's adding
 
04:03:14.590 --> 04:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
a specific area of cod but we have done
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
that in other areas too if you if if
 
04:03:19.469 --> 04:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
women are being denied life-saving
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
health care because doctors are worried
 
04:03:23.870 --> 04:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
about being sued that would be a reason
 
04:03:25.469 --> 04:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
to put something into the patient's Bill
 
04:03:27.429 --> 04:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
of Rights and when you look at the
 
04:03:29.070 --> 04:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
endometriosis you look at some of the
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
other things that could lead to that you
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
would might need a hysterectomy to treat
 
04:03:35.229 --> 04:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
and when that's being denied because of
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
what seems to be a fear of being sued
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
because of um because the person won't
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
be able to conceive in the future I
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the areas where it
 
04:03:44.670 --> 04:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
is important for the government to step
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
in and say that there is specific
 
04:03:49.630 --> 04:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
protection here uh this is just one of
 
04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
those areas that is so tough I I know
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
women who never wanted children and then
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
had children and they love them I know
 
04:03:57.070 --> 04:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
other women that never wanted children
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to say it out loud
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
but they kind of wish it hadn't happened
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
anyways um and some of them perpetuated
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
cycles of abuse I mean it can be a
 
04:04:07.149 --> 04:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
challenge but when you're looking at a
 
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
woman who has a medical condition and is
 
04:04:12.149 --> 04:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
denied treatment for what seems to be
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
just concerned about future f
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to dealing with a true and
 
04:04:18.349 --> 04:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
present medical condition I I think that
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
it is the role of the state to do
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
something here and I believe that adding
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
that protection from a lawsuit um based
 
04:04:28.110 --> 04:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
upon the future childbearing capacity in
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
a sterilization um even if it's not
 
04:04:32.670 --> 04:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
against medical advice is a good step
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
forward in order to ensure that women
 
04:04:37.510 --> 04:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
people are getting this life-saving
 
04:04:41.790 --> 04:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
what is to prevent
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
a provider having a patient sign a
 
04:04:51.279 --> 04:04:52.269 align:start position:0%
a provider having a patient sign a
consent

04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
consent
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
form against the risk and so forth Etc
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking about is you can sign
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
yourself out of a
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
hospital against medical
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
advice so what I'm trying to understand
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
is why we need this spill to begin with
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
why can't there be a form that the
 
04:05:09.070 --> 04:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
position has or provider has that
 
04:05:09.080 --> 04:05:10.469 align:start position:0%
position has or provider has that
clearly

04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:05:12.750 --> 04:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
articulates what the downside is and so
 
04:05:15.149 --> 04:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
forth you're absolving me of all of the
 
04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and so forth I've told
 
04:05:18.510 --> 04:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
you everything I need to tell you and
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
you still want to go forward I'll be
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
glad to honor that request is because
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
you fully understand it I'm not an
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm looking at least two of me
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
um why can't that form be signed by the
 
04:05:30.319 --> 04:05:31.950 align:start position:0%
um why can't that form be signed by the
patient

04:05:31.950 --> 04:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
today representative
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
Nel I think I'm answering what you're
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
saying because it was a question that I
 
04:05:41.710 --> 04:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
kind of raised and I I
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how bu find ing these
 
04:05:46.349 --> 04:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
things are you know I just because I
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
have somebody sign something they still
 
04:05:49.950 --> 04:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
can come back and sue me later and I'm
 
04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
just I don't know what the legalities of
 
04:05:54.189 --> 04:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
this are I'm almost starting to wonder
 
04:05:55.710 --> 04:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
if we're straying into the wrong
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
commission for this committee for this
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill and you know like somebody would
 
04:06:02.429 --> 04:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
have more expertise on on the question
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
you just asked because I don't know and
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
I've been told a million times when we
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
when I designed my own inform consense
 
04:06:07.960 --> 04:06:09.550 align:start position:0%
when I designed my own inform consense
representative

04:06:09.550 --> 04:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I'm I'm not an
 
04:06:15.309 --> 04:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
expert on inform consent uh but I'm
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
remembering my first school
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent who said nothing I can
 
04:06:20.830 --> 04:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
tell you will prevent you from being
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
sued a lot of what I can tell you can
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
keep you from being sued
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
successfully um so there is that
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
distinction um but I think that what
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
both of you are working towards is
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
exactly what I was saying originally
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
this is the wrong place in the statute
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
if we were to do it it doesn't belong in
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
the patients Bill of Rights it belongs
 
04:06:45.510 --> 04:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the statute that deals with civil
 
04:06:45.520 --> 04:06:46.750 align:start position:0%
in the statute that deals with civil
actions

04:06:46.750 --> 04:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
actions
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
against um Physicians if there's one
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's very specific but and and there's
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are because I can
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
remember the medical panels and all of
 
04:06:58.349 --> 04:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
that stuff so it it belongs in a
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
completely different section of the
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
statute and it belongs in the Judiciary
 
04:07:03.870 --> 04:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
Committee when we're talking about
 
04:07:06.550 --> 04:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
limitations of liability because they
 
04:07:09.030 --> 04:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
are the committee that deals with that
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
and um in that respect I do wonder if
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
this is something that we might not want
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
to interim study um in terms of um
 
04:07:27.790 --> 04:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
getting a more
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach and getting it to
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
the right committee next time around
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then me
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro then
 
04:07:35.520 --> 04:07:37.910 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro then
representative

04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:40.389 --> 04:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
Merchant yes thank you Mr chairman I I
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
wonder um if I could ask the lawyer in
 
04:07:45.550 --> 04:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
the room who may not be an expert in
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
this area but is a lawyer uh what does
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
it mean shall have no Civil Right of
 
04:07:53.550 --> 04:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
action does that mean they can't sue or
 
04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
does that mean they can't win a
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
sue it it the words say to me and I'll
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
defer to representative kofalt if
 
04:08:04.149 --> 04:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
because I'm an elder law attorney and I
 
04:08:05.950 --> 04:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been since
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
1996 in another state but it it means
 
04:08:12.149 --> 04:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
that there is no cause of action but I
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
don't know whether this
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
con uh conflict specifically with items
 
04:08:20.910 --> 04:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
in the civil litigation parts of our
 
04:08:23.229 --> 04:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
statutes which may say something very
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
different and and you know I just don't
 
04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
know the answer to
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
that representative merchant do you
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
question if this is not an early bill
 
04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
can we reassign this to another
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee once we've got a hearing on it
 
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
we can you can't push it over no the
 
04:08:44.040 --> 04:08:45.070 align:start position:0%
we can you can't push it over no the
second

04:08:45.070 --> 04:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair so I'm not
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to interim study um I'm a I'm a
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
firm believer that um Speedy legislation
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
is a bad idea and I think we should take
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
take things slowly and and do it right I
 
04:09:02.750 --> 04:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of just even if I
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
like the intent and I like the idea I'd
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
rather it get done right in the right
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
Committee in the right way so I know I
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm in favor of it but I also like
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
the idea of it being passed in a
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Manner and if it's going to
 
04:09:16.830 --> 04:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
be divisive I'd rather it not be I'd
 
04:09:18.510 --> 04:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
rather it go to interim study so that's
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
just my two sents representative
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you um I was going to say that
 
04:09:24.750 --> 04:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
I thought that this was going to get
 
04:09:26.429 --> 04:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
more support from this approach I
 
04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
actually would like to be able to take a
 
04:09:30.269 --> 04:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
look at pairing down item a and I'm
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
curious if we would be okay to um
 
04:09:34.710 --> 04:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion U and then move this
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
one to March 20th if we don't have that
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be our last day to exec if we come
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
here and we don't have a solution then I
 
04:09:41.910 --> 04:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
think it would become an easy interim
 
04:09:43.149 --> 04:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
study but I'd like to have a little bit
 
04:09:44.910 --> 04:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
more more time to deal with the fact
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
that important medical procedures are
 
04:09:49.389 --> 04:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
being put off because of somebody's
 
04:09:52.510 --> 04:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
reproductive would beate um I think that
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
March 20th will be our cleanup date and
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
I we could do March 6 but there's a few
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
other bills to to focus on by then I'd
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
like to be able to have the time to look
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
at this and quite frankly I'm looking at
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
doing some ma some U major work ahead of
 
04:10:06.910 --> 04:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
March 6 on other bills so I wouldn't be
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
able to give it the time that I want um
 
04:10:11.109 --> 04:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
before March 20th our representative
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
Merchant is
 
04:10:17.070 --> 04:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
if that's to be done which I think makes
 
04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense is this permissible to
 
04:10:24.030 --> 04:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
Move It from this RSA to another RSA
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
where it belongs can we do that or we
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
have to go through another
 
04:10:30.990 --> 04:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
hearing no representative Weber I
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
believe and I'd be glad to be corrected
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
by Miss Dyer if she has thoughts on it
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think that moving it from
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
one spot in the statute to another spot
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the statute is going to have an
 
04:10:42.640 --> 04:10:44.630 align:start position:0%
in the statute is going to have an
effect

04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I mean we certainly do move things
 
04:10:48.000 --> 04:10:49.870 align:start position:0%
um I mean we certainly do move things
around

04:10:49.870 --> 04:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the other question I was going to ask
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
Miss Dyer is um there's no reason why we
 
04:10:59.469 --> 04:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
can't simply leave things the way they
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
are and and if we recess this hearing we
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
start with the amendment on the floor we
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
start with the amendment right we don't
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
have to withdraw the amendment before to
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
to recess the hearing we just start
 
04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
where we left off off is that correct uh
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
so I have no objection to giving it more
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
time representative Lon um thank you um
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
I do know that some other bills and some
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
other committees because of change
 
04:11:26.790 --> 04:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
statutes have been ruled on gerain if I
 
04:11:28.349 --> 04:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
do find that there's a different section
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
of of the statutes it's appropriate then
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
I'll work with the chairman to see about
 
04:11:34.309 --> 04:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
a non gerain um Amendment hearing should
 
04:11:36.109 --> 04:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
that be necessary ahead of that March
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.990 --> 04:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes so any uh hearing on that would
 
04:11:49.229 --> 04:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
have to happen well ahead of that
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative palazov then
 
04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I will
 
04:11:55.870 --> 04:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
join the majority if you want to recess
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
it but my preference is to pass at least
 
04:12:02.670 --> 04:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
something to help those suffering
 
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
because I see it as an issue that
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
probably still exist but it might not
 
04:12:10.349 --> 04:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
exist in a couple years because culture
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
is changing in the past it was no to
 
04:12:16.670 --> 04:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
have many kids now now it's not so much
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
so I think Physicians will are catching
 
04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
up with the current uh uh time so I see
 
04:12:29.950 --> 04:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
this issue could solve itself like maybe
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
next year maybe in two years so but if
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
it still exist maybe if we pass at least
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
this um minus
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
in representative Nel um I have two
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
comments one
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
um when we were hearing the hearing it's
 
04:12:48.269 --> 04:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of times is as representative King
 
04:12:50.109 --> 04:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
said sometimes the voice that's not in
 
04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
the room is the most important voice
 
04:12:53.950 --> 04:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes in and brings a bill
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
forward who've seen six different
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
doctors from very different perspectives
 
04:12:59.469 --> 04:12:59.479 align:start position:0%
all of them said they don't think the
 
04:13:02.590 --> 04:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
surgery is a good idea that raises some
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
red flags that maybe not doing the
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
surgery was the right idea um I we don't
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
know because they weren't here and they
 
04:13:11.790 --> 04:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
didn't Testify the other thing I wanted
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
to raise was I suppose the futility of
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
04:13:19.870 --> 04:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
thing so I've been sued once in my
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
entire medical career and um I got this
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
notice that I was being sued there were
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
five other doctors involved all five of
 
04:13:29.070 --> 04:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
us were being sued the reason we were
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
being sued as failure to diagnose and
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
treat I diagnosed the person and I
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
initiated therapy for this specific
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
diagnosis the minute I saw her so I
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
thought well all right fine they'll let
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
me off so um and the other four missed
 
04:13:45.189 --> 04:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis which I don't blame them
 
04:13:47.070 --> 04:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
it it was in my field it wasn't in there
 
04:13:49.790 --> 04:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
so anyways so I thought well that's
 
04:13:51.510 --> 04:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
great we're done I'm going home the next
 
04:13:53.950 --> 04:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
thing I find out is that nope we're
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
going to continue we're just going to
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
even find another creative reason to sue
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
you and $20,000 of legal expenses later
 
04:14:04.389 --> 04:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
and you know yeah sure I didn't I got
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
found without a problem or innocent or
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
whatever term you want to use but
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
$20,000 stress and time I'm not sure
 
04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
these things actually ever prevent
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
anything and that is the point of what
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish with this
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is to prevent
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
it other
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
discussion all right so what's the
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
pleasure of the committee we G to
 
04:14:25.399 --> 04:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
pleasure of the committee we G to

Weber so just recess the whole thing
 
04:14:32.910 --> 04:14:32.920 align:start position:0%

04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
20th is that does that is that agreeable

04:17:32.910 --> 04:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
brief um there was uh some concern
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
brought up um uh in in testimony about
 
04:17:40.830 --> 04:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
this bill that um when you go about
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
redefining uh what is a non-communicable
 
04:17:47.670 --> 04:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
disease that it may leave um exposed
 
04:17:49.630 --> 04:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
tetus and there was concerns that you
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
know we wanted to maintain uh
 
04:17:57.309 --> 04:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
vaccination for tetanus so um I in in in
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
the interest of of providing something
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's palatable for the folks on the
 
04:18:03.630 --> 04:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
committee um I I put that in as a
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
compromise and so that um it it it makes
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
clear that uh vaccination uh for tetus
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:17.830 --> 04:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um the idea of
 
04:18:19.229 --> 04:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not we include tetanus in
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a non-issue under age
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
seven because you can't receive any of
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
the other childhood vac you can't
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
receive the rest of the full pallet of
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccinations without having
 
04:18:30.550 --> 04:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
the tetanus shot in the combined ones
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
that you get below h s but tetanus is a
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
very nasty disease that is irreversible
 
04:18:37.710 --> 04:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
um as it goes along you can stop it in
 
04:18:39.309 --> 04:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
its process but we don't really want to
 
04:18:41.229 --> 04:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
see people going through that that
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
terrible situation
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that it should be very clear
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
that in public health if we are if we
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
are requiring any vaccines it should be
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
so that stops human to human
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
transmission because that's the whole
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
argument is the herd immunity so when
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about something that
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have person-to person
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
transmission I think the argument in the
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
case is a lot weaker so by narrowing up
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
our statutes I think that that will help
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
to um I just think that'll help to have
 
04:19:08.070 --> 04:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
greater public support as we are
 
04:19:11.149 --> 04:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
recognizing threats in the future um so
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
while I don't think that the addition of
 
04:19:15.790 --> 04:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
accept accept this is actually necessary
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
to protect our kids I'm very happy to
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
include it in order to address the
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had received in uh in
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
people's responses and
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:31.469 --> 04:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'm struggling with the two
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
words infectious and
 
04:19:36.429 --> 04:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
transmittable not sure they are separate
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
from each other and mutually exclusive
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
therefore isn't one the same I'm not a
 
04:19:44.189 --> 04:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
English major but I think I'm looking at
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
the two saying if something's infectious
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
is probably transmittable but
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
something's probably transmittable could
 
04:19:51.149 --> 04:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
be infectious so I'm not quite sure
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're trying to do here
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative mlan thank you Mr J um
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that infectious is
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily transmissible from
 
04:20:06.269 --> 04:20:06.279 align:start position:0%
person to person I could have for
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
example a flesh eating disease which is
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
very rare but you know can kind of go
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
through and consume my body uh so it is
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
infectious but it's not transmissible so
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding if the if the
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
legal understanding however is that
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
infectious and transmissible uh from
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
person to person are synonymous then I
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
think that would just reinforce uh the
 
04:20:31.830 --> 04:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
fact that it it doesn't really need to
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
be there so if if legally they they're
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
synonymous I don't think that you would
 
04:20:40.510 --> 04:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
need it there um but but if but I I I
 
04:20:41.830 --> 04:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
think from the testimony the
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
understanding was no infectious is
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
something that can go through your body
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and spread through your body but it's
 
04:20:49.710 --> 04:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily transmissible person to
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
person representative kushman and then
 
04:20:53.950 --> 04:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr
 
04:20:55.710 --> 04:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um yeah I was just going to
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
give my my feedback um I was taught in
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
nursing school infectious disease is any
 
04:21:04.990 --> 04:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
disease it could be caused by a fomite
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
which is an object that may have some
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
something on it um that's not person to
 
04:21:12.790 --> 04:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
person um or it could be like malaria
 
04:21:16.109 --> 04:21:16.119 align:start position:0%
where there's a vector um a mosquito in
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
that case not person to person those are
 
04:21:21.670 --> 04:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
you could even just have pneumonia um
 
04:21:23.469 --> 04:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
that is a secondary infection from
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
bronchitis or something that's not
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
communicable it's not transmitted from
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
person to person but it is
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
infectious representative Weber and then
 
04:21:32.239 --> 04:21:34.590 align:start position:0%
infectious representative Weber and then
representative

04:21:34.590 --> 04:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you um my concern is the uh
 
04:21:41.950 --> 04:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
transmissible with removing infectious
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
is if only have transmissible from
 
04:21:46.590 --> 04:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
person to person then we have removed
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
all of the vector diseases and as we
 
04:21:50.389 --> 04:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
know we have a lot of them and they
 
04:21:54.670 --> 04:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
we're getting more and um I don't want
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
to stand in the way of a treatment if
 
04:22:02.030 --> 04:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
there is one um I I just think this is
 
04:22:05.070 --> 04:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and inadvisable so I'm going
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
to vote uh I I I might vote Yes on the
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
amendment because it makes a little more
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
clear but um I'm really a no on
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
everything representative Nagal and then
 
04:22:17.600 --> 04:22:21.309 align:start position:0%
everything representative Nagal and then
representative

04:22:21.309 --> 04:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
Shapiro microphone I have a comment and
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
a question um I mean the comment is
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
infectious to me means viral bacterial
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
or fungal I I think that's pretty
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
straightforward but the question is um
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
in this chapter child
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
means um 18 and under and I and I do
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
know that you do receive tetanus
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinations like you know after seven
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
if you have exposure I mean you're
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to get them up for you every 10
 
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
years or so so that that would I mean if
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
if we assume that that's the definition
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
of child which it says in statute then
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
then that that does become important as
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
its own separate thing I think that's my
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
impression representative
 
04:23:05.309 --> 04:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes um I'm wondering if
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's possible always possible to discern
 
04:23:08.960 --> 04:23:09.910 align:start position:0%
it's possible always possible to discern
what's

04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
what's
 
04:23:13.109 --> 04:23:13.119 align:start position:0%
transmittable personto person and what
 
04:23:15.109 --> 04:23:15.119 align:start position:0%
not and I I would defer to
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative kushman who knows more
 
04:23:18.070 --> 04:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
about this than me or one of the other
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
medical providers for the um malaria has
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
been um brought up I had a bad case of
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
malaria at one point and my
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
that that mosquito that gave me malaria
 
04:23:37.229 --> 04:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
bit somebody else who had malaria and so
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
it's not being directly transmitted but
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's still being transmitted from person
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
to person so I'm just wondering if you
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
can really be so clear in all cases
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
about what's transmitted person to
 
04:23:53.429 --> 04:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
person and what
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
isn't representative kushman um well if
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
you like if you look at the at any
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
disease like go to the CDC website it'll
 
04:24:05.710 --> 04:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
tell you how is this transmitted fomite
 
04:24:08.910 --> 04:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
vector or is it communicable is a human
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
to human transmission so I mean they are
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
distinguished are is considered a vector
 
04:24:20.109 --> 04:24:20.119 align:start position:0%
born it can yes it came through someone
 
04:24:22.389 --> 04:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
else who was infected but there's a
 
04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
there's another variable in that Chain
 
04:24:25.479 --> 04:24:26.269 align:start position:0%
there's another variable in that Chain
of

04:24:26.269 --> 04:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
Infection and some diseases also can be
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
transmitted to that Vector from an
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
animal as well and we can't control wild
 
04:24:37.149 --> 04:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
animals in their vaccination uptake um
 
04:24:40.109 --> 04:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
so the way I look at it is yes it it can
 
04:24:43.790 --> 04:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
be delineated and it is in in
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
practice representative
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
pmer thank you Mr chair and I I
 
04:24:51.790 --> 04:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the amendment because
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
tetus was one of the big things that I
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
was concerned about initially but I
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
think that I'm also concerned about
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and malaria is a
 
04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
great example and while we don't have a
 
04:25:05.550 --> 04:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
lot of it here now and I'm just going to
 
04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
use this as an example with climate
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
change we may and the problem that we
 
04:25:14.670 --> 04:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
get into is that while it is a mosquito
 
04:25:17.950 --> 04:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
that you need you also need a reservoir
 
04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
and the reservoir is humans and now that
 
04:25:23.149 --> 04:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's a vaccine for malaria it'll be
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
really interesting to see what happens
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
in the countries that have significant
 
04:25:29.189 --> 04:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
amounts of malaria as more and more
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
people get immunized and that Reservoir
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
goes away so there's now when the
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
mosquito bites somebody they're less
 
04:25:37.229 --> 04:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
likely to have malaria so then when you
 
04:25:38.830 --> 04:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
get bitten by that mosquito you're not
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
going to be so I guess my my objection
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
to the over bill is that is that there
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
are a lot of things that may happen in
 
04:25:48.189 --> 04:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
the future that we don't know and you
 
04:25:51.790 --> 04:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
know 20 years from now I I don't want us
 
04:25:53.950 --> 04:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
to have to enact new legislation to get
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
rid of this so that we can give the
 
04:25:58.990 --> 04:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
malaria vaccine to our kids because now
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's a real
 
04:26:03.030 --> 04:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
problem other discussion representative
 
04:26:06.030 --> 04:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you um so respectfully
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
there are alternatives to preventing
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
malaria people already take um
 
04:26:13.910 --> 04:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
antivirals you know monthly or every six
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
months in Africa to prevent malaria and
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know we we can't legislate on what
 
04:26:21.870 --> 04:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
potentially will happen in the
 
04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
future so I think right now we have this
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
in front of us with the understanding
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
that the whole premise of the the state
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
even being able to mandate any vaccine
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
on any person is due to the common good
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
that might be at stake right and so if a
 
04:26:43.389 --> 04:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
if a disease is non-com communicable
 
04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
there's no common good to be working for
 
04:26:50.469 --> 04:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
and we're leaving tetanus in here you
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
know as a as a olive branch um and to
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
alleviate concerns about this one
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
disease that I personally don't believe
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the state has any right to tell
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
parents to that they have to give their
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
children anyway because it can't be
 
04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
transmitted to other children um so I
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
think for what we have right in front of
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
us right now now this is the right thing
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
to do we're just correcting this
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
definition this was an oversight that
 
04:27:20.670 --> 04:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
this term infectious was left here um
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
because the statute was trying to say
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
that you know the whole intent of this
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
part of the statute was to say no
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
noncommunicable diseases shall be have
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinations required of our our
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
citizens so we're we're just correcting
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
this and if there is a drastic need and
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
we find that we have a an epidemic of of
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
um malaria in the United States that the
 
04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
impetus will be there for the
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to come together and do
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
something about that thank you Miss
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
Rogers um you mentioned that this uh to
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
miss da about this being school age but
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
bill it's in the statute that way okay
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:21.790 --> 04:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you yeah could you come up
 
04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.109 --> 04:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
please thank you Abby Rogers legislative
 
04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
pleas on division Public Health um I
 
04:28:38.189 --> 04:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
just want I was telling um Christina
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
Dyer just as a reminder that this bill
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
is RSA RSA 141 C20 d a which is the
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
statute the governs requirements for
 
04:28:49.349 --> 04:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
school and daycare attendance for
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination so just just wanted to
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
remind you that that's the statute that
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
that would be affected by this change in
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay thank you thank you
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
any any questions for M Rogers while
 
04:29:00.910 --> 04:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
she's up here or represent
 
04:29:00.920 --> 04:29:03.349 align:start position:0%
she's up here or represent
representative

04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant this goes back to a previous
 
04:29:08.830 --> 04:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill I think probably from last time but
 
04:29:12.269 --> 04:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
help me understand under the
 
04:29:15.109 --> 04:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
RSA 141
 
04:29:17.950 --> 04:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
c2a that allows the department to add
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
additional vaccines under
 
04:29:24.269 --> 04:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
541a has the department actually added
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
any vaccines to the ones listed here in
 
04:29:29.229 --> 04:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
Statute in rule
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
making uh do you want to come up um I'm
 
04:29:33.790 --> 04:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
gonna ask my colleague um am McCurry to
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
come up to talk she's from the
 
04:29:40.590 --> 04:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
you good after afternoon I'm am Mar mcir
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
immunization section chief um it has
 
04:29:47.550 --> 04:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
been a number of years since any new
 
04:29:50.510 --> 04:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
immunization requirement has been added
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
um I think it's been a decade um it's
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a long time um and the
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
department does not have any um
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
additional uh vaccines that we would
 
04:30:01.710 --> 04:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
like to propose to be added at this time
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're very comfortable with the listing
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that we've been very um
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
conservative in our approach um when we
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
look at other states there are many
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
other states that have many more U
 
04:30:13.109 --> 04:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements than New Hampshire
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
does um and I just would like to put out
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
that um when we're talking about
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases or non-communicable
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
diseases um a communicable disease is
 
04:30:27.710 --> 04:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
one that's infectious or spread by
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
direct or indirect contact and also
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
transmissible human to human there are
 
04:30:34.229 --> 04:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
germs there are pathogens that are
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
spread um through indirect contact um so
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
there are viruses that can live on
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
inanimate surfaces that can be picked up
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
in later
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
um you know cause infection um so there
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
is concern about removing the word
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
infectious from this disease um and
 
04:30:51.790 --> 04:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
definition follow
 
04:30:55.469 --> 04:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
up so basically I understand the process
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
to go through rul making which is RSA
 
04:31:01.870 --> 04:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
541a that does require legislative
 
04:31:03.109 --> 04:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
approval because it has to go through
 
04:31:03.119 --> 04:31:05.630 align:start position:0%
approval because it has to go through
Jare

04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%

04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative okay our representative n
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
my question I just wanted to make sure
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
children applies up to age 18 this
 
04:31:20.670 --> 04:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
definition correct statute uh the
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
statute reply is um relative to the
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
school immunization requirements so it
 
04:31:28.189 --> 04:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
would be any child within the school
 
04:31:28.199 --> 04:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
would be any child within the school
systems

04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:31:32.710 --> 04:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay other discussion representative
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question do we have any data
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
on health outcome in those less conserv
 
04:31:46.349 --> 04:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
States regarding vaccination so if they
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
have more vaccines required uh does it
 
04:31:54.030 --> 04:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
have higher child mortality or lower
 
04:31:54.040 --> 04:31:55.109 align:start position:0%
have higher child mortality or lower
child

04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:31:58.429 --> 04:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
mortality could you provide us may lat
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
with some information on
 
04:32:05.070 --> 04:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question um we
 
04:32:06.510 --> 04:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
could we could see what we could find
 
04:32:08.590 --> 04:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
for you um and and send it to you
 
04:32:13.870 --> 04:32:13.880 align:start position:0%

another motion yes thank you Mr chair um
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
I would move ought to pass as amended
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
with Amendment
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
0809 H motion is there a second
 
04:33:51.869 --> 04:33:51.879 align:start position:0%
representative mour seconds any
 
04:33:55.390 --> 04:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
discussion further representative McLean
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you Mr chair so um I've
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
been I've been listening uh to the
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
debate on the amendment and I've been
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
writing frantically um and so I'm not a
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I'm not a doctor um but it is
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding um that you know the
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
standards for mandating for
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
immunizations is that there has to be a
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest um and so I
 
04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
kind of take that into account when I'm
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill John Jay who was
 
04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
the the first justice of of of the
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court you know once said that um
 
04:34:34.029 --> 04:34:34.039 align:start position:0%
in in America the American people are uh
 
04:34:36.830 --> 04:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
sovereigns without subjects and that's a
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
large part of where the Dignity of the
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
American people come from and you know
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
parents um act as Regents for their
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
children up until they're able to come
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
into their own sovereignty and you know
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
Jay himself recognized the fact that
 
04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
there's no there's there are limitations
 
04:34:56.910 --> 04:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
on that sovereignty otherwise you
 
04:34:59.310 --> 04:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't have a function in society and
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's implicit in in the social
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
contract and you know where that
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
threshold is is to have a compelling
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
State interest and so you know when I
 
04:35:10.830 --> 04:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
was looking at some of the case law and
 
04:35:12.990 --> 04:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a laer but you know in
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
amongst all the co Wars um you couldn't
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
help but hear on the radio the The
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
Jacobson case being referenced over and
 
04:35:22.910 --> 04:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
over and over again which was uh
 
04:35:25.390 --> 04:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
Jacobson versus Massachusetts in
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
1905 Jacobson was a Swedish immigrant
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
who' been vaccinated back in Sweden uh
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
he came to the United States and they
 
04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
had a massive smallpox outbreak in
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
Cambridge Massachusetts and because of
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
his bad experience he almost died he
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
said I don't want to get vacc v inated
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and so the Supreme Court took up that
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
case and they ruled in fact that yes
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
indeed the state of Massachusetts could
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
compel Jacobson to be vaccinated and the
 
04:35:56.510 --> 04:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
reason was that the threshold of a
 
04:35:59.390 --> 04:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest was met
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
because you know one in three people in
 
04:36:03.910 --> 04:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
Cambridge died and and the the
 
04:36:03.920 --> 04:36:05.429 align:start position:0%
Cambridge died and and the the
vaccination

04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
04:36:08.429 --> 04:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
requirement was very limited in a scope
 
04:36:09.869 --> 04:36:09.879 align:start position:0%
it was just you know in that Metro
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
Boston area it wasn't even a flying out
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
in Western Massachusetts you know
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
certainly not in the entire State and so
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
I think you know when I look at this
 
04:36:23.390 --> 04:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
bill I think this bill really is taking
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
that question of the compelling State
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
interest head on and it's answering that
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
question and I think it really
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
references Jacobson in it's saying that
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
hey if we have something that is a
 
04:36:40.830 --> 04:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
transmissible disease such as measles we
 
04:36:43.629 --> 04:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
know that measles can go into a school
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
and it can run through the class
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
classroom like wildfire not everybody is
 
04:36:51.869 --> 04:36:51.879 align:start position:0%
able to be immunized and so in order to
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
provide herd immunity in that case then
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely fine and the threshold
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
for compelling State interest is met in
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
requiring immunization for mths measles
 
04:37:06.670 --> 04:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
or anything like that um and so I think
 
04:37:09.869 --> 04:37:09.879 align:start position:0%
this bill really clarifies that you know
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
but my understanding though is that some
 
04:37:16.029 --> 04:37:16.039 align:start position:0%
of these nonhuman vectors I mean while
 
04:37:17.670 --> 04:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're real and we talked a little bit
 
04:37:20.269 --> 04:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
about America I don't know uh not
 
04:37:24.429 --> 04:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
America but um uh malaria
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
um that it it doesn't rise to that same
 
04:37:31.470 --> 04:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
level and we could essentially under
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
that rubric go and start mandating
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines for everything and I really
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
think that we need to be careful and
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
always air on the side of that
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
individual sovereignty and and take into
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
account what that threshold should be I
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
really think that this bill clarifies
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
that and uh I'm G to support the bill
 
04:37:55.070 --> 04:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative cofal thank you Mr
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I think what we've seen
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
over the past well over the past several
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
decades since Congress granted blanket
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
immunity to manufacturers of
 
04:38:08.949 --> 04:38:08.959 align:start position:0%
vaccines um we have seen as a an
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of of that I
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
think that we have seen a proliferation
 
04:38:16.830 --> 04:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
of vaccines um including some that are
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
not mandated in New Hampshire but are
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
mandated elsewhere uh in cases where
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
children probably are not at risk um
 
04:38:30.510 --> 04:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
so you know so so I think we've seen a
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
proliferation of vaccines we are also
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
now with mRNA technology seeing a kind
 
04:38:39.390 --> 04:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
of redefinition of what what a vaccine
 
04:38:42.510 --> 04:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
is um at one time a vaccine
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
um meant s of injecting a a a weakened
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
or dead virus into someone so that they
 
04:38:51.310 --> 04:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
could develop a natural immunity now
 
04:38:53.470 --> 04:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
apparently it means something very very
 
04:38:56.429 --> 04:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
different if I do a Google search for
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
non uh vaccines for non-communicable
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
diseases um interestingly it doesn't
 
04:39:04.750 --> 04:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
bring up tetus but it does bring up a
 
04:39:06.510 --> 04:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
lot of things that seem to be on the
 
04:39:09.869 --> 04:39:09.879 align:start position:0%
drawing board um for things like obes
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
obesity asthma arthritis psoriasis
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
multiple sclerosis Crohn's disease and
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
others um the question ultimately will
 
04:39:19.709 --> 04:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
come down to somebody making the
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
argument that why would you want to put
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
your child at risk they should have to
 
04:39:26.830 --> 04:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
have this
 
04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine because indeed that is the
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
argument that is made about tetus and
 
04:39:36.429 --> 04:39:36.439 align:start position:0%
others in the case of tetanus it's it's
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it's it's a reasonable
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
argument but it's one of those things
 
04:39:42.590 --> 04:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
that really needs to be we one at a
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
time on the other side you see a great
 
04:39:50.070 --> 04:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
many people not just lay people but you
 
04:39:52.350 --> 04:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
see a lot of people in the medical
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
community who have serious reservations
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
about vaccines and particularly serious
 
04:39:59.470 --> 04:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
reservations about some of the new
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
technology that's coming out what this
 
04:40:05.550 --> 04:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
bill does is essentially say we want to
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
draw a line in the sand and say there
 
04:40:08.638 --> 04:40:09.868 align:start position:0%
draw a line in the sand and say there
there

04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
is arguing ably a basis for telling
 
04:40:14.760 --> 04:40:15.670 align:start position:0%
is arguing ably a basis for telling
people

04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
that they need to as as a member of the
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
herd so to speak they need to um
 
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
contribute to the or or participate in
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
the process I'm not making that argument
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
I'm simply saying that is the argument
 
04:40:30.830 --> 04:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to non-communicable
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
diseases however I think that
 
04:40:37.110 --> 04:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
argument falls apart and it really comes
 
04:40:40.590 --> 04:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
down at that point to somebody saying
 
04:40:42.550 --> 04:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
you ought to do this for your child
 
04:40:46.110 --> 04:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
because I believe it's good
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
and that leaves little room for someone
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
else to say I don't want to do that for
 
04:40:53.070 --> 04:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
my child because I think it's bad for
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
them um that ultimately comes down to
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
the individual rights of of parents to
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
make the decision that they think are in
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
the best interest of their children so
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate that New Hampshire is
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
actually among the states that has the
 
04:41:12.628 --> 04:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
shortest list if not the shortest list
 
04:41:15.070 --> 04:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
one of the shortest lists in the country
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
of mandated vaccines I think it's
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
prudent to draw a line and say there is
 
04:41:23.910 --> 04:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
a point particularly with this shifting
 
04:41:27.150 --> 04:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
Dynamic of redefining what a vaccine is
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
and expanding the coverage of vaccines
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
to to any number of non-communicable
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
diseases I think it is reasonable and
 
04:41:35.910 --> 04:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
prudent to uh to set a limit and I think
 
04:41:38.590 --> 04:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill does that other
 
04:41:38.600 --> 04:41:41.430 align:start position:0%
that this bill does that other

04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
else I made that request for
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative mlan I must have typed
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
looks like everybody has a copy if I may
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
if you want to proceed sure thank you Mr
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you members of the
 
04:45:26.670 --> 04:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
committee um so this bill as amended um
 
04:45:28.110 --> 04:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
it would repeal the vaccine
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping requirement just for the
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
licensed dayc carees so that the private
 
04:45:35.948 --> 04:45:35.958 align:start position:0%
schools are no longer part of the bill
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh if you recall uh the recordkeeping
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
requirement added a burdensome um costly
 
04:45:44.628 --> 04:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
and timec consuming uh effort on the
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
part of employees of daycares uh and
 
04:45:50.270 --> 04:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
schools but uh we're focused on daycares
 
04:45:52.110 --> 04:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh in chasing down and trying to obtain
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
those records uh we have multiple ways
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
that parents can maintain their records
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire uh their
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
providers have the records and if they
 
04:46:04.990 --> 04:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
desire to opt in which most do their
 
04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
records are in the New Hampshire
 
04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
immunization information
 
04:46:11.708 --> 04:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
system and um
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
this just takes away that burdensome
 
04:46:18.270 --> 04:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
requirement for the daycares um they
 
04:46:20.030 --> 04:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
were charged with acting as an
 
04:46:22.110 --> 04:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement arm for something that's
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
required of all children in New
 
04:46:26.590 --> 04:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether they attend daycare or
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
school or not and uh that was an
 
04:46:31.948 --> 04:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
inappropriate burden to place on them
 
04:46:35.788 --> 04:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
they are not a part of um the branch of
 
04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
government that enforces our laws and so
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
this would just help a struggling
 
04:46:44.548 --> 04:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
industry um have an easier time to
 
04:46:45.788 --> 04:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
conduct their
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
business okay representative South K
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just a question
 
04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
for the amendment it seems like we're
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
watering down the bill a little bit with
 
04:46:57.868 --> 04:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment um by getting rid of the
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
public school part um that was
 
04:47:03.150 --> 04:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
originally going to be in there and um
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
so basically we're making it easier for
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
the child care agencies public or
 
04:47:09.788 --> 04:47:09.798 align:start position:0%
private but what about private schools
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
did we want to not allow them to also
 
04:47:14.750 --> 04:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
kind of opt out of this thanks um So
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
based on the discussion that was had
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um and feedback that
 
04:47:22.750 --> 04:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
we got um the public school I mean the
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
private school piece of it um was
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
something that some people were really
 
04:47:29.788 --> 04:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
stuck on and in the interest of um
 
04:47:31.628 --> 04:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
getting something across that can help
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
the daycares at least that's why we
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
compromise representative Weber
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um this does deal with my
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about the public schools but uh
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
so I will probably vote for the
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
amendment but um if I were the child of
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
if I were the parent of a child going to
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
daycare I would want to know what kind
 
04:48:00.910 --> 04:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
of an environment I was sending my child
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
to and I think that these kinds of
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
Records would be something I would want
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
in making my determination about what
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
was best for my child and
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
therefore I think it's ill
 
04:48:16.270 --> 04:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
advised representative Leon
 
04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative March thank you Mr
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and representative Weber um I
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
recognize your concern there is nothing
 
04:48:24.548 --> 04:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
in here that would prohibit a Child Care
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
Agency from collecting these records and
 
04:48:29.070 --> 04:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
advertising that they that what their
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates are and letting PE
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
parents know who are looking for that
 
04:48:35.390 --> 04:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for um right now we
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
have a huge burden in child care it
 
04:48:39.628 --> 04:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
requires more recordkeeping by doing
 
04:48:41.708 --> 04:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
this some parents are concerned by this
 
04:48:44.948 --> 04:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
others aren't so by removing this this
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
mandated burden while allowing childcare
 
04:48:49.030 --> 04:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
agencies that wish to continue to
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
collect immunization records it seems
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a good way to address that
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
shortfall and still leave that choice
 
04:48:55.948 --> 04:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
for parents who are seeking out the
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
highly immunized
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant I think one of the things I
 
04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
is sharing information we talk about
 
04:49:09.310 --> 04:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
this in the medical community about
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
informed consent there's nothing in here
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
that provides to the parent like an
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
informed consent whether the Child Care
 
04:49:17.310 --> 04:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
Agency is going to collect the data or
 
04:49:20.350 --> 04:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
not so therefore if parent is going to
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
bring the child to a daycare center not
 
04:49:24.628 --> 04:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
knowing what the status is of collecting
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
the data and what they're doing with
 
04:49:29.070 --> 04:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
immunization I think we're not really
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
informing the parent adequately to
 
04:49:33.390 --> 04:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on so if there was an
 
04:49:36.670 --> 04:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
informed consent in here the parent is
 
04:49:36.680 --> 04:49:37.470 align:start position:0%
informed consent in here the parent is
been

04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
clearly explain to them whether they in
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
the data what they're doing and they
 
04:49:44.350 --> 04:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
sign off on it that's a different story
 
04:49:45.750 --> 04:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
they're just blindly going into it
 
04:49:47.590 --> 04:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
information representative
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
pmer I'm trying to remember um and maybe
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
somebody can help me is did child care
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
agencies did they testify in this and
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
because representative Shapero and then
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative kosman
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
I would just say that there was some
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that it was a problem but
 
04:50:17.708 --> 04:50:17.718 align:start position:0%
there was also testimony from the the
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
YMCA of New Hampshire that they were
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
against this bill and they um
 
04:50:25.470 --> 04:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
representing all the dayc carees at
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
their agencies that they are in favor of
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
this being
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
you um so I just wanted to speak to the
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
common misconception that there can be
 
04:50:44.830 --> 04:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
any guarantee that the child care center
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
that you're sending your child to
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any unvaccinated children
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
because all children in New Hampshire H
 
04:50:54.510 --> 04:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
have the right to a medical or religious
 
04:50:57.310 --> 04:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
exemption and it's illegal to
 
04:50:59.788 --> 04:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
discriminate against somebody being
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a daycare based on their
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs or if they have a
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
disability which both of those
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions would fall under um so there
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
are plenty of unvaccinated kids in
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
daycare in schools right now that no one
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
you have no right to know their medical
 
04:51:19.230 --> 04:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
status um no one does they might have a
 
04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
religious belief or a medical condition
 
04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
um that precludes them from
 
04:51:26.350 --> 04:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination and um I don't think that
 
04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to affect that except
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
that it may allow some day carees to
 
04:51:36.150 --> 04:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
advertise on the fact that they do
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
require that record keeping and they
 
04:51:42.990 --> 04:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
could run on a platform and appeal to
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
people who are looking for that where
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
right now um it kind of conflicts with
 
04:51:47.400 --> 04:51:48.230 align:start position:0%
right now um it kind of conflicts with
the

04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:50.350 --> 04:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
law representative Missour and then
 
04:51:52.548 --> 04:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yes thank you uh
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
since the YMCA was brought up um yes
 
04:51:59.708 --> 04:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
they they oppose it but we heard from
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
several others that they support this
 
04:52:06.990 --> 04:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
and the thing is with the YMCA even this
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
bill does not require anyone not to do
 
04:52:13.470 --> 04:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
that so it's they if the YMCA still
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
wants to advertise this they can it it
 
04:52:18.270 --> 04:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
gives them the option to and maybe they
 
04:52:20.590 --> 04:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
have the Staffing to do all of that that
 
04:52:23.070 --> 04:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
the other child care agencies that
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
testified to us didn't so um you know
 
04:52:29.350 --> 04:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
the the why was one example and as we
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
know they're a very large organization
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
that may have adequate Staffing to do
 
04:52:35.190 --> 04:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
this but many others don't and they are
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
suffering because of it so we need to
 
04:52:39.470 --> 04:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
listen to those too representative
 
04:52:39.480 --> 04:52:42.670 align:start position:0%
listen to those too representative
Shapero

04:52:42.670 --> 04:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:45.270 --> 04:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman I think we
 
04:52:46.830 --> 04:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
probably just have conflicting
 
04:52:48.990 --> 04:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
philosophies about these kinds of things
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to vote against the Bill
 
04:52:55.628 --> 04:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
Amend it or not because I feel like the
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
requirement of reporting vaccinations in
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
schools is historically part of the
 
04:53:03.310 --> 04:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
public health fabric that we've
 
04:53:05.948 --> 04:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
developed in this country and it's one
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
and of course not every kid who um goes
 
04:53:12.670 --> 04:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
to a daycare or public school is
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
um is vaccinated and um in fact we've
 
04:53:19.150 --> 04:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
had some outbreaks of diseases in Keen
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
at the local waldor school because a lot
 
04:53:24.030 --> 04:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
of the parents there don't believe in
 
04:53:27.070 --> 04:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so it's not a guarantee but
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
in my mind the reporting to schools
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
about vaccinations is one of the things
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
that encourages more kids more families
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated which is uh in my mind
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
is uh a important important Public
 
04:53:41.680 --> 04:53:44.628 align:start position:0%
is uh a important important Public
Health

04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
Health
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
um it's important to Public Health and
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
it I I realize it doesn't do it for
 
04:53:52.270 --> 04:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
other people for but for me it trumps
 
04:53:55.470 --> 04:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
people's individual right to not get
 
04:53:58.750 --> 04:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated okay any other
 
04:54:01.150 --> 04:54:01.160 align:start position:0%

04:57:24.990 --> 04:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
motion representative Nagel I'd like to
 
04:57:27.628 --> 04:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
make a motion on HB 1240 and expedient
 
04:57:27.638 --> 04:57:28.390 align:start position:0%
make a motion on HB 1240 and expedient
to

04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
legislate okay is there a second
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero seconds
 
04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel do you want to
 
04:57:35.548 --> 04:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sure I the first
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
comments are going to be gerain to the
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
next three bills but um I'm on the
 
04:57:41.948 --> 04:57:41.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis oversight board and
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to explain a little bit
 
04:57:45.548 --> 04:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
about the process the the C the
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
oversight board did not um support this
 
04:57:51.390 --> 04:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
bill um generally speaking what's done
 
04:57:53.910 --> 04:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
is they solicit um evidence-based
 
04:57:56.910 --> 04:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
reviews um uh on each of the conditions
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
that comes up um there were two separate
 
04:58:03.310 --> 04:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh um uh reviews that
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
came up one was by somebody I would
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
consider fairly conservative on this
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
issue and the other person fairly
 
04:58:09.788 --> 04:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
liberal and they both agreed to the
 
04:58:09.798 --> 04:58:10.628 align:start position:0%
liberal and they both agreed to the
evidence

04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
um uh did not support it we will also
 
04:58:15.470 --> 04:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
accept anecdotal evidence and the
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
conclusion was there was not sufficient
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence to support uh
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis for um Eating
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
Disorders it's important to understand
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
or know that um the anorexia from an
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
eating disorder is very different from
 
04:58:32.708 --> 04:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
the anorexia from say malignancy or
 
04:58:34.548 --> 04:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
infectious disease or something along
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
those lines in the eaing disorder the
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
person is purposely trying to suppress
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
their appetite
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
by various means in order to achieve a
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
distorted body image um the concern was
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
and there is some evidence for this is
 
04:58:51.230 --> 04:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
that when you start giving cannabis to
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
somebody outside the realm of the
 
04:58:55.390 --> 04:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
complex interdisiplinary treatment they
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
receive that they engage in binge eating
 
04:59:00.390 --> 04:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
start and and basically disrupt the
 
04:59:02.070 --> 04:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
entire treatment process and in the end
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
it actually turns out to be harmful not
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
helpful um on the flip side if you have
 
04:59:09.590 --> 04:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
malignancy with anorexia you don't have
 
04:59:11.548 --> 04:59:11.558 align:start position:0%
any appetite because of the disease
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
process so actually uh cannaboids can
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
actually help that by stimulating your
 
04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
appetite to achieve a lean body mass the
 
04:59:21.548 --> 04:59:21.558 align:start position:0%
other issue that was raised that's
 
04:59:24.150 --> 04:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
really important also is that anorexia
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
or eating disorders in general complex
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
disorders there's multiple comorbidities
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
including um anxiety disorder which
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about next um
 
04:59:36.070 --> 04:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
depression post-traumatic stress
 
04:59:38.110 --> 04:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
disorder those things are all dealt with
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
separately and we believe that um each
 
04:59:41.948 --> 04:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
of these comorbidities should be done
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
separately and it's perhaps a woman or
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
whatever with an eaing disorder may
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
qualify or may be helped based on one of
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
their other comorbidities but not this
 
04:59:54.548 --> 04:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
one other representative
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
Weber well I want to thank
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel for that because um
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
it this one was one that I was very much
 
05:00:05.470 --> 05:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
on the fence about and what had occurred
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
to me was the issue of um um binging
 
05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
eating being an eating disorder and it
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to me like this this was
 
05:00:16.830 --> 05:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
going to actually help
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
um and so I really appreciate that
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
explanation and you have changed me from
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
a maybe ought to pass to an itl so thank
 
05:00:30.270 --> 05:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Shapiro and then
 
05:00:30.280 --> 05:00:32.350 align:start position:0%
you representative Shapiro and then
representative

05:00:32.350 --> 05:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chairman I would just
 
05:00:36.868 --> 05:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
like to
 
05:00:40.990 --> 05:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
um add kind of a a larger question which
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
is since we passed one bill giving
 
05:00:47.948 --> 05:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
doctors a great deal of discretion not
 
05:00:49.750 --> 05:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
doctors but providers a great deal of
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
discretion about um qualifying
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
People based on their expert opinion is
 
05:01:01.628 --> 05:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
it time to stop qualifying different
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
categories for um specific diagnosis
 
05:01:09.070 --> 05:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
representative nich I I thought the
 
05:01:11.230 --> 05:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
exact same thing and I mean I think
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're kind of locked in for this year
 
05:01:17.670 --> 05:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
that we have to do that um I I will say
 
05:01:20.590 --> 05:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
like um you know my big concern about
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
all these things is that now I'm
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
blanking out what I was goingon to say
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
I'll shut
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
up representative mlan and then
 
05:01:29.548 --> 05:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King no I was just
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
gonna kind of build on representative
 
05:01:33.270 --> 05:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
Shapiro was kind of going along the same
 
05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
lines I think there's still value in
 
05:01:37.430 --> 05:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
having the the the two-tier system for
 
05:01:39.510 --> 05:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons that were brought about in
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony earlier but
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
certainly this does allow latitude as
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
new information comes in with the
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
two-tier system for them to be able to
 
05:01:50.510 --> 05:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that without having
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
something that is explicit I think so I
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
think we're okay I figured out what I
 
05:01:59.150 --> 05:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
was gonna say okay let representative SE
 
05:02:01.470 --> 05:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
K go and then I'll go back to
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
you remember it make keep that thought
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
hold that thought I'm writing it
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
down thank you Mr chair um
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
I I lean on the side of if somebody has
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
a hangnail they should be able to get
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis quite frankly I don't think the
 
05:02:17.310 --> 05:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
government really has any role in
 
05:02:19.628 --> 05:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
deciding what reasons you need cannabis
 
05:02:23.070 --> 05:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
for um that being said I also agree that
 
05:02:25.150 --> 05:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh with representative Shapiro I'm not
 
05:02:26.830 --> 05:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
really a fan of the idea of having all
 
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
these subcategories you know you either
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
you either get it or you don't we don't
 
05:02:32.948 --> 05:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
need the government to list every single
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
disorder um but the world we live in is
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
we do have that and so we have to decide
 
05:02:39.948 --> 05:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to allow uh
 
05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
something like this to go and so my
 
05:02:47.110 --> 05:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
question for example Dr Dr Nagel is I'm
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
not quite sure what the concern is here
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
are you concerned that somebody who
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have a dis uh an eating
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
disorder is going to use that as an
 
05:03:01.390 --> 05:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
excuse to get cannabis or are you
 
05:03:03.548 --> 05:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
concerned that somebody who really does
 
05:03:06.510 --> 05:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
have a an eating disorder is going to
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
use cannabis and they're going to have
 
05:03:09.320 --> 05:03:10.590 align:start position:0%
use cannabis and they're going to have
negative

05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
negative
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
consequences as a result um to me I'm
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
curious what what the what the answer is
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
but even even then there there's always
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
the possibility that somebody who does
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
have an eating disorder could benefit
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
from this and for that reason alone I
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
don't ever want to see somebody have to
 
05:03:32.910 --> 05:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
go to the doctor's office and lie to the
 
05:03:34.990 --> 05:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
doctor in order to get the permission
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
slip to get the medication they believe
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
they need so thank you
 
05:03:43.868 --> 05:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
yeah I I mean oh sorry F I'm next okay
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
you kind of touched on what I wanted to
 
05:03:48.430 --> 05:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
say anyway so the process right now is
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
such that you come to me and I have to
 
05:03:52.830 --> 05:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
have a relationship of some sort with
 
05:03:54.430 --> 05:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
you so it's not like I'm just meeting
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
you for the first time so we've had time
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
to sit down and discuss this there's
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
also an obligation on my part that I
 
05:04:02.190 --> 05:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
need to sit down and discuss with you
 
05:04:04.990 --> 05:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
all these separate diagnoses that we're
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
coming up with each and every year I
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
have to decide whether you fulfill one
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
of those diagnoses or not then I certify
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
you it goes to the state and then they
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
basically decide if you qualify or not
 
05:04:17.670 --> 05:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
at no point am I ever actually
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
prescribing or doing anything for you
 
05:04:22.270 --> 05:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just certifying you have a condition
 
05:04:25.628 --> 05:04:25.638 align:start position:0%
um is there an ability to lie probably
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the concerns that I've had
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
about the process though is there
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
assumes when there's a medical
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
indication or medical use that there's
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
some level of oversight so if example I
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
prescribe a blood pressure medicine for
 
05:04:39.390 --> 05:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
you there's an assumption I'm going to
 
05:04:41.390 --> 05:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
over oversee that and follow you for
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
that what I'm finding out now is that
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
this is what's going on that nobody's
 
05:04:48.670 --> 05:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
really overseeing this at all we're just
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
certifying you you're going to a
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
dispensary you're getting it and you're
 
05:04:53.948 --> 05:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
just doing what you want the concern
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
with anorexia was that if somebody
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
chooses to do that they could since
 
05:05:01.628 --> 05:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
there is really no oversight well I
 
05:05:03.150 --> 05:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say there's none in a lot of
 
05:05:05.230 --> 05:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
cases there's none that they could
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
actually be harmed by that because now
 
05:05:08.548 --> 05:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
they're actually creating what they
 
05:05:10.230 --> 05:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
don't want they're going to create a
 
05:05:13.230 --> 05:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
binged a large person distorted body
 
05:05:14.548 --> 05:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
image and they're going to actually set
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
their care back a a long ways and the
 
05:05:20.070 --> 05:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
concern with there being no oversight is
 
05:05:21.190 --> 05:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
that you're going to create a bigger
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
problem than you start it out with and
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
and and that's why we believe that this
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
should not be included as an indication
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
with that said if the person has a
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder or an
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorder or anyone of the other
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
number of indications that they may be
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
all right but it's really important to
 
05:05:40.590 --> 05:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
watch and keep keep an eye on them
 
05:05:42.548 --> 05:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
because they could go off the edge and
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
actually aggravate the problem not help
 
05:05:47.190 --> 05:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
it so I hope does that answer your
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:54.788 --> 05:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm concerned that we're
 
05:06:03.150 --> 05:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
getting these various
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
disorders without any recommendation for
 
05:06:06.638 --> 05:06:07.868 align:start position:0%
disorders without any recommendation for
the

05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:12.510 --> 05:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
professional um uh committee uh dealing
 
05:06:17.070 --> 05:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
with uh investigating the treatment uh
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
possibilities so I I feel like I should
 
05:06:24.510 --> 05:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
not vote for this uh based on the fact
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation if they did I'd like to
 
05:06:32.910 --> 05:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
know what it
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.510 --> 05:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
two Health Care Providers actually did
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
an evidence-based review of this
 
05:06:47.310 --> 05:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
particular um issue and both came to
 
05:06:49.868 --> 05:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
identical conclusions that there was no
 
05:06:52.830 --> 05:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
empiric evidence to support this to
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
support cannabis for this particular
 
05:06:59.548 --> 05:06:59.558 align:start position:0%
issue now that you've brought that up I
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
I brought up at the last meeting that I
 
05:07:03.548 --> 05:07:03.558 align:start position:0%
really think we need expert testimony
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
before our committee about issues like
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
this and and as you said it may be moot
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
now we may not need to do this but
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
I would love to have like a child an
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
eating disorder expert come and testify
 
05:07:18.670 --> 05:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
on to us we don't do that um when they
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
do these reviews they do have the option
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
of actually interviewing somebody along
 
05:07:25.110 --> 05:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
those lines but they do not testify to
 
05:07:28.470 --> 05:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
US Representative Merchant just to be
 
05:07:31.470 --> 05:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
short on my records we are doing an is
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
not an
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.150 --> 05:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
itl expedient to legisl versus is okay I
 
05:07:39.160 --> 05:07:41.150 align:start position:0%
itl expedient to legisl versus is okay I
thought

05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
thought
 
05:07:45.548 --> 05:07:45.558 align:start position:0%
I any other representative Weber I was
 
05:07:48.590 --> 05:07:48.600 align:start position:0%

05:07:51.310 --> 05:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
are opposed to having the
 
05:07:53.868 --> 05:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
condition included in the statute you're
 
05:07:56.350 --> 05:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to be voting yes on an inexpedient
 
05:07:59.868 --> 05:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
motion just because we've gotten a
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
little wound up here so we could just be
 
05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
clear about this we could vote against
 
05:08:12.430 --> 05:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
the itl and vote for not yes we could I
 
05:08:15.190 --> 05:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
won't other
 
05:08:17.910 --> 05:08:17.920 align:start position:0%

05:10:43.470 --> 05:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
49 is there a second representative
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
Missour seconds would you like to speak
 
05:10:46.708 --> 05:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
to your motion um this will be a lot
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
reer you already know the process um we
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
did have one evidence-based review on
 
05:10:54.070 --> 05:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
this one that came out very supportive
 
05:10:56.350 --> 05:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
there's abundant anecdotal information
 
05:10:58.510 --> 05:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
to support the use of cannabis for
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorder uh in my work with the
 
05:11:04.030 --> 05:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
NFL um we interview players that are on
 
05:11:06.270 --> 05:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
um cannabis and uh the vast majority of
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
them actually take it for anxiety or
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
sleep disorder not pain interestingly um
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
But anxiety is the most common reason I
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
believe that people actually use Canabis
 
05:11:19.150 --> 05:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
for medicinal reason so it was actually
 
05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
the unanimous vote of the um um
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
05:11:26.548 --> 05:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
board to I'm sorry I'm wrong it was
 
05:11:30.390 --> 05:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
this okay so your motion is OTP any
 
05:11:35.628 --> 05:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
other discussion on this motion
 
05:11:38.030 --> 05:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy this is a question
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
for um question for representative Nagel
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
um this a more of a question than a
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
comment or
 
05:11:49.628 --> 05:11:49.638 align:start position:0%
otherwise you know obviously we voted or
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
we we're split on the last one based on
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know um Eating Disorders but now
 
05:11:58.270 --> 05:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
we've P we're on the track to maybe pass
 
05:12:01.708 --> 05:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
one for anxiety disorders but my
 
05:12:03.548 --> 05:12:03.558 align:start position:0%
question is and again from your
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
perspective where are we going to end up
 
05:12:07.350 --> 05:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
with you know well we're going to have
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
to have Bill after Bill after Bill is
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
when to ask
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
for all the multiple entities that we're
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
going to face going down the road and
 
05:12:16.670 --> 05:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be a what I'm wondering is
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
should this bill just be ited as well so
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
that another build comes in in more of a
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
general way to term to identify those
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
disorders uh or should we just assign
 
05:12:30.510 --> 05:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
that to um the Cannabis commission or
 
05:12:32.110 --> 05:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
whatever that might be I'm just
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
wondering how long we're going to keep
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
you know doing this with multiple bills
 
05:12:38.510 --> 05:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
and disorders that is an amazingly great
 
05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
question because I've been involved in
 
05:12:41.830 --> 05:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
this discussion since that commission
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
was OB actually created and I would have
 
05:12:47.788 --> 05:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
never done it the way it's being done
 
05:12:50.830 --> 05:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that is the process um
 
05:12:53.590 --> 05:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
you may have inspired me to submit a
 
05:12:55.990 --> 05:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill to change the process but I think
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're kind of stuck with what we've got
 
05:13:00.310 --> 05:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
right now but I I I just think it's a
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
flawed process in a lot of different
 
05:13:04.990 --> 05:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
ways and um I mean I've only been to one
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
meeting but um I've already seen things
 
05:13:10.230 --> 05:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
that concern me but I think is a very
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
good point the same point we are where
 
05:13:14.670 --> 05:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
we are um there are a lot of people with
 
05:13:16.590 --> 05:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorder right now that would
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
like access to this therapy and I think
 
05:13:20.430 --> 05:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
that this is unfortunately the only way
 
05:13:22.270 --> 05:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
to get them we actually have already
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
approved it for post-traumatic distress
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
disorder which actually is an anxiety
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
related disorder as well so that's
 
05:13:30.270 --> 05:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
already included um I'm a little shocked
 
05:13:31.548 --> 05:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
that this wasn't one of the first
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
indications way back
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
when representative Lon and then
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh thank you Mr
 
05:13:40.590 --> 05:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
chairman we did pass the we passed the
 
05:13:43.470 --> 05:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
more encompassing Bill however it's not
 
05:13:45.310 --> 05:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
yet signed into law and the question is
 
05:13:47.150 --> 05:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not it will be um there's
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
another one that hopefully uh comes out
 
05:13:50.350 --> 05:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
of the house so that people wouldn't
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily even need to have an anxiety
 
05:13:55.150 --> 05:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation for somebody to walk over
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
to a store and purchase some if they
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to do that and an anxiety
 
05:14:00.868 --> 05:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
situation that that may be an
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate approach too but until
 
05:14:05.670 --> 05:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
either or both of those laws be uh bills
 
05:14:07.470 --> 05:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
becomes law I think that it's really
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
important to move forward on anxiety
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
because you know you look at benzo dioa
 
05:14:12.670 --> 05:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
pans you look at some of the other stuff
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
used to treat anxiety I think that
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
adding cannabis to that potential range
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
of options is is a good idea um it may
 
05:14:22.750 --> 05:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
not be right for everybody but neither
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
are benzos neither are other options and
 
05:14:27.110 --> 05:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
neither are the people for their medical
 
05:14:30.070 --> 05:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
Martini so I I think this is um
 
05:14:31.628 --> 05:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully we won't need to do
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
all of these in the future but let's get
 
05:14:35.590 --> 05:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
this one done today representative Weber
 
05:14:37.350 --> 05:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh I think representative Leon
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
said pretty much what I was going to say
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh it would be nice to have a better
 
05:14:46.270 --> 05:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
procedure and we ought to work on that
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
but until we get one this is something
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
that there is some evidence that it is
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
helpful it is much more benign than some
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the other treatments and so I think
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
we ought to make sure that there is a
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle that authorizes it that stays
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
alive representative
 
05:15:05.868 --> 05:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
Merchant I want to follow up on
 
05:15:07.948 --> 05:15:07.958 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's
 
05:15:07.958 --> 05:15:09.548 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's
uh

05:15:09.548 --> 05:15:09.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:12.430 --> 05:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
comment is it possible to go back to
 
05:15:15.070 --> 05:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and look at adding eight that
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
basically says or any other
 
05:15:20.030 --> 05:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
disorder authorized by the Cannabis
 
05:15:21.150 --> 05:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and give them
 
05:15:22.270 --> 05:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority and they get
 
05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves out of this representative we
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
did you have a response for that well I
 
05:15:29.948 --> 05:15:29.958 align:start position:0%
kind of it's It's partly a response and
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's partly
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
history the reason that the bill is the
 
05:15:35.708 --> 05:15:35.718 align:start position:0%
way it is is it was the only way we
 
05:15:37.990 --> 05:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
could get it passed it was the only way
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
we could get the governor's sign it and
 
05:15:44.548 --> 05:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
we have been as greater knowledge occurs
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
and as greater experience occurs and as
 
05:15:49.868 --> 05:15:49.878 align:start position:0%
people get less scared of all of this
 
05:15:53.110 --> 05:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
we've been broadening things uh I don't
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
think now is the time to start trying to
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
shoehorn other things in I think what we
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
ought to do is see where we end up at
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
the end of this year and then because
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know the the landscape may be very
 
05:16:12.910 --> 05:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
different in June than it is now and
 
05:16:15.030 --> 05:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
then I think we ought to try and come up
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
with something more comprehensive and
 
05:16:19.868 --> 05:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
considered that that we've looked at
 
05:16:22.510 --> 05:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
really carefully and with the in uh
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
input from the commission and and that
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
may be the way we go but I think that
 
05:16:30.750 --> 05:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
right now what's before us is anxiety
 
05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
disorder and as uncomfortable as I am
 
05:16:36.510 --> 05:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
and I am keeping on adding things in I
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
think that the approach that we adopted
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
was to have the commission evaluate what
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
might be useful and what might be
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
harmful and to take that into account in
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
making our decisions so I I'd like to
 
05:16:55.948 --> 05:16:55.958 align:start position:0%
keep that for now until we know where
 
05:16:58.548 --> 05:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
we're at representative Murphy and then
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you it's just
 
05:17:03.470 --> 05:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
a a plea to uh representative Nagel uh
 
05:17:05.230 --> 05:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
that I would vote for this bill no no
 
05:17:06.670 --> 05:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
question about it general anxiety
 
05:17:08.830 --> 05:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
disorder is an appropriate indication
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the use of U therapeutic cannabis I
 
05:17:12.910 --> 05:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
just want us to be prepared because my
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
concern is a more broad issue going
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
forward we ought to be prepared for uh
 
05:17:19.708 --> 05:17:19.718 align:start position:0%
the next year having long CO as one of
 
05:17:22.510 --> 05:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
the indications for
 
05:17:24.910 --> 05:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis keep
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
growing um I I I don't I I personally
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
think that based on my exper I mean it's
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
not that I haven't involved in this
 
05:17:34.948 --> 05:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
commission I've just been to one meeting
 
05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
but I've been very aware of it for a
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
long time and I think having um some
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
oversight of it has a lot of value
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
personally the other statement I don't
 
05:17:47.190 --> 05:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
want to leave unchallenged is we we look
 
05:17:49.548 --> 05:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
at cannabis like it's this trivial drug
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
it is most definitely not it creates a
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
lot of problems it ruins a lot of
 
05:17:57.390 --> 05:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
people's lives it is the gateway drug
 
05:17:59.470 --> 05:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
according to people at office of
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
restorative justice for a number of
 
05:18:04.830 --> 05:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
other drug addictions and I think we
 
05:18:09.110 --> 05:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
need to be really cautious about how we
 
05:18:11.070 --> 05:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
proceed with this
 
05:18:15.070 --> 05:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.628 --> 05:18:17.638 align:start position:0%

you up yes Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
05:20:11.708 --> 05:20:11.718 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass on HB
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
1350 there second second would you like
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion representative
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
McLean yeah I I think this is a this is
 
05:20:21.510 --> 05:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
a pretty straightforward Bill
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
the uh oh yeah that's right okay sorry
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm retreating I didn't know we
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
had bills like that famous last
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
words the the TCM o um unanimously was
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill what it does is
 
05:20:40.230 --> 05:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
it moves moves the the amount that can
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
be spens dispensed from the ATC from 2 O
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
up to 4 ounces in in a 10-day period
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
which is I I think a modest increase um
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's my understanding that we the
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
amount of atcs we have in the state is
 
05:20:57.788 --> 05:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
only like four or five so for people in
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
rural communities I think that creates a
 
05:21:02.230 --> 05:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
big burden maybe it might drive them to
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
go look elsewhere I really don't want to
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
to have that happen so I think this is a
 
05:21:09.150 --> 05:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
modest proposal as I said
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
um unanimous support from the TCM o um
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
so I hope everybody will support it
 
05:21:16.350 --> 05:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you other discussion
 
05:21:18.990 --> 05:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I support it as
 
05:21:21.788 --> 05:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
well I think I'd rather see this come to
 
05:21:23.390 --> 05:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
the point of having more locations
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
available versus having people to go a
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
long distance regardless of the amount
 
05:21:29.548 --> 05:21:29.558 align:start position:0%
of um cannabis um but unfortunately
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
that's not the bill before Force the
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
bill before force is to allow for a
 
05:21:35.110 --> 05:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
greater amount to be taken at one time
 
05:21:36.670 --> 05:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see a bill somewhere
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
along the way to revise the THC
 
05:21:40.510 --> 05:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
location so patients don't have to
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
travel in the first
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
place other
 
05:21:47.670 --> 05:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none motion is ought
 
05:21:50.590 --> 05:21:50.600 align:start position:0%

yes yes okay representative McDonald
 
05:22:55.910 --> 05:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes 19 to zero and one not voting
 
05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
andent U there's no
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
objection Mr chair can I make a
 
05:23:03.548 --> 05:23:03.558 align:start position:0%
suggestion going forward could we
 
05:23:06.628 --> 05:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
possibly take up 1609 FN next because I
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
think that that one's likely to be
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
less fraud easy given the fact we have
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
eight minutes
 
05:23:15.868 --> 05:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
left I think we can try and get both of
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
them done in that time you'll be
 
05:23:19.070 --> 05:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
surprised well why don't we do 1609 and
 
05:23:21.868 --> 05:23:21.878 align:start position:0%
then if we can get the 1482 then all
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
right so our next up is 169 FN I have a
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I have a motion for
 
05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment okay by 1609 okay and the
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is passed out already it
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
should be at your seat I move that we
 
05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:45.868 --> 05:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
0755 okay uh would you like U
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy seconds
 
05:23:48.510 --> 05:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative pushman do you want to
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you uh as
 
05:23:53.948 --> 05:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
discussed during the hearing uh there is
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
no representation on the uh membership
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the interdisciplinary Primary Care
 
05:24:03.150 --> 05:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce Commission and uh it was
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
recommended that we amend and I did
 
05:24:09.310 --> 05:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
speak um with
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
remind me her
 
05:24:13.548 --> 05:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
name Dr
 
05:24:13.558 --> 05:24:15.670 align:start position:0%
name Dr
Murphy

05:24:15.670 --> 05:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
05:24:19.190 --> 05:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
Mary yes and um she was okay with adding
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
them in and having them a part of the
 
05:24:23.230 --> 05:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
conversation there too uh so I put in an
 
05:24:25.390 --> 05:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to add a direct primary care
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
provider appointed by the New England
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care
 
05:24:29.040 --> 05:24:30.590 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care
Alliance

05:24:30.590 --> 05:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
Alliance
 
05:24:32.670 --> 05:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
okay any
 
05:24:35.430 --> 05:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this amendment
 
05:24:39.708 --> 05:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that it's the case although
 
05:24:44.150 --> 05:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's although it's the New England
 
05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
Direct Care primary Alliance do we
 
05:24:47.948 --> 05:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
assume that they're appointing a New
 
05:24:47.958 --> 05:24:50.190 align:start position:0%
assume that they're appointing a New
Hampshire

05:24:50.190 --> 05:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
provider they have providers in New
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not specified that it
 
05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
will be a New Hampshire
 
05:24:59.948 --> 05:24:59.958 align:start position:0%
provider um but I'm not sure if all of
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
the members on the board are necessarily
 
05:25:04.670 --> 05:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire
 
05:25:04.680 --> 05:25:06.470 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire
anyway

05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
anyway

England representative
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
Murphy um I don't have a problem with it
 
05:25:21.310 --> 05:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
being specified one way or the other um
 
05:25:23.230 --> 05:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
as we'll see going forward um there
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
going to be a number of alternative
 
05:25:28.270 --> 05:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
payment you know um methodologies coming
 
05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
forward and they'll be both regionally
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide and nationally um run so for
 
05:25:36.030 --> 05:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
instance and I was I mentioned this
 
05:25:38.070 --> 05:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
before to representative kushman last
 
05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
night or this morning driving in i'
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
listen to the radio and you may not know
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
it yet but Amazon Prime is now going to
 
05:25:46.990 --> 05:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
come out with a primary care uh package
 
05:25:49.628 --> 05:25:49.638 align:start position:0%
as well offering primary care and it may
 
05:25:51.788 --> 05:25:51.798 align:start position:0%
start off as mostly tele medicines but I
 
05:25:52.830 --> 05:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
think what we're going to see going
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
forward is that we're going to have a
 
05:25:58.708 --> 05:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
number of um not just local but
 
05:26:01.470 --> 05:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
regionally and nationally these type of
 
05:26:04.110 --> 05:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
organizations that will be um uh getting
 
05:26:06.670 --> 05:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
into the primary care market and so if
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
they if New England direct Prim care is
 
05:26:11.670 --> 05:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
the one that appoints it um it would it
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
would be fine more than likely it would
 
05:26:15.310 --> 05:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
have to be New Hampshire only because
 
05:26:17.310 --> 05:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
Primary Care is going to be local and
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
you want to have you know you don't want
 
05:26:20.070 --> 05:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
to have a primary care in Rhode Island
 
05:26:23.948 --> 05:26:23.958 align:start position:0%
and have somebody from um Co County in
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
represent of Kings area drive all the
 
05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
way down there so it would probably um
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
by the nature of primary here be more
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
close local to their constituents or
 
05:26:33.400 --> 05:26:35.230 align:start position:0%

in this one they could give us a fiscal
 
05:29:36.910 --> 05:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
impact at the time I got the bill anyway
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I have no there's no objection we'll
 
05:29:41.868 --> 05:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
put that on consent for it all right now
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%

05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh would you like to speak to
 
05:30:17.310 --> 05:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
your motion yeah I just want to say that
 
05:30:19.390 --> 05:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
um while I am a supporter of the general
 
05:30:21.788 --> 05:30:21.798 align:start position:0%
idea of bringing a Marketplace involved
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the sale of blood and organs um this
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill is so poorly crafted that I don't
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
think we should be wasting any time
 
05:30:30.270 --> 05:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
debating the merits of that I hope that
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
next year the sponsor or somebody else
 
05:30:34.510 --> 05:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
will bring forward a bill that we can
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
really that those of us who support the
 
05:30:37.628 --> 05:30:37.638 align:start position:0%
idea can really get behind and then
 
05:30:39.230 --> 05:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
we'll but for this year I think it
 
05:30:40.830 --> 05:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
should just be put to rest
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative palaza uh well I
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
understand I will be in absolute
 
05:30:48.750 --> 05:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
minority I think it should be out to
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
pass this bill is an important step to
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
solve the shortage of blood and organs
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
and it's all immoral situation when our
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
heroic donors are not only fairly
 
05:31:05.548 --> 05:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
compensated but sometimes they are
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
punished for example uh they have to pay
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
pay for their recovery and sometimes uh
 
05:31:15.430 --> 05:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
their life insurance is in danger from
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
Their donation we are being told by
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that current system is working
 
05:31:26.430 --> 05:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
and moral uh but last year you remember
 
05:31:29.070 --> 05:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
we heard the same but uh only to learn
 
05:31:32.750 --> 05:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
that uh federal government itself is
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
trying uh to fix it by breaking the
 
05:31:38.830 --> 05:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
United Network for sharing organs Yus
 
05:31:40.948 --> 05:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
multi- deade Monopoly because the
 
05:31:44.830 --> 05:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
situation is so dire and broken uh so we
 
05:31:47.350 --> 05:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
currently allow to sell plasma and other
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
organs uh so this bill will help to save
 
05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
lives thank you other
