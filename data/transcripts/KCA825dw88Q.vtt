hearing that is an error uh I did close

the public hearing last week there is no
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
reason for me to reopen it again it was
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
just a typo we didn't discover the uh
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
error until beyond the 24hour notice
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
window so I couldn't make the correction
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%

sir thank you Mr chairman uh thank you

00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
I feel like it's old home
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
week it's great to be
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
here uh as you know I'm I'm not a person
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
of many words I just keep it short so
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
and that's what I intend to do today
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
um today I'm presenting uh House Bill
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
305 relatives to speed and red light
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
cameras for traffic
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement um every one of you lives
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
someplace in New Hampshire and every
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire is having
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
trouble finding police officers I know
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
the the state police at one time were
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
down 40 people I don't know what the the
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
current is right now uh in Kean where I
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
am and I'm also a city counselor in Kean
 
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
we were down 11 people at one time I
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
think we've got it down to minus four
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
right now so having police officers out
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
there monitoring traffic is tough right
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
now the other issue that's bothering us
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
across the state is more and more
 
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
erratic driving especially by younger
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
people uh we see it everywhere um just
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday in Kean we had a a gentleman
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
get run over by a vehicle and then two
 
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.669 align:start position:0%
get run over by a vehicle and then two
other

00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh just because of erratic
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
driving it's it's it's happening
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere and this is just a tool to
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
help those that need it um I'm just
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
going to summarize the bill I'm not
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
going to read it the bill introduces a
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
new section to the existing law allowing
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
a mines pality I to install and utilize
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement cameras included
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
speed monitoring monitoring and red
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
light cameras at their discretion the
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities will be responsible for
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with the
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
installation and maintenance of these
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
camera systems and that's important I'll
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
talk about that in a minute additionally
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
they must collaborate with the
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to ensure that
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
cameras are installed and operated in
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with state and federal laws
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
the bill EMP emphasizes that the
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities will be held liable for
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
any lawful operations of the unlawful
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
operations of the camera system uh the
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
difference between us and the other
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
states that
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
have traffic cameras many of them use a
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
third party uh where they're working on
 
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.110 align:start position:0%
third party uh where they're working on
a

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
commission they they get the data on the
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
driver they send the tickets and they
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
get a commission from the municipality
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
I purposely avoided that we don't
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
want we don't want that in New Hampshire
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh the city the municipalities have full
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
control there is no third party there is
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
no spreading of information among
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
private companies and there's
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
no last minute uh trying to trying to
 
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
no last minute uh trying to trying to
get

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
through I think it's very simple it's
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
just uh something to help uh all of our
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal police departments
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
and I would gladly take any questions Mr
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you sir questions from the
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
committee represent Miller thank you Mr
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testimony I'm
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
curious you mentioned that they would
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
have to be administered by the
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities rather than a third party
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
yes um are there products out there that
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
are available that do that I feel like
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
this is one of those things when the
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
third parties get involved and manage
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
all those systems sometimes they sort of
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
take over the ecosystem and there
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even be a product
 
00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
available thank you for that very good
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
question they are and you are correct
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
there are products out there um many
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
states use that third party product uh
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
and that's what we don't want here um I
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
work as a um a manufacturers rep I
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
travel all over and uh I see it in many
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
cities where they have that uh Province
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island for some reason my ways
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
system tells me when there's a camera
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
ahead it must give off some kind of
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
system or something like that the third
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
party cameras uh just don't seem to be
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
working and there's more complaints
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
about the third party cameras that's why
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
I specifically put this in the hands of
 
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.070 align:start position:0%
I specifically put this in the hands of
the

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities thank you
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
sir representative
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and welcome
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
back um can you go over again what the
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
list of violations that these cameras
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
would be looking
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
for it's it's mostly speeding erratic
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
follow so let's say someone runs Rod
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
light and this camera catches it what's
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
the process if someone get like a like a
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
bill in the mail or violation in the
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
mail to say here's a ticket how how does
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
that all work uh well each municipality
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
would handle it their own way that's
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's the other beauty of this that the
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities can determine how it will
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
be done um I
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
know good lawyer would CH if somebody
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
does get uh a violation of summons a
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
good lawyer would challenge it in court
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
but good lawyers also challenge radar
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
speed radar guns and they also
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
challenged the height I seen them try
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
challenge the height of a stop sign
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
because it was 4 in too low they
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh they went
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
free thank
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
committee represent gon thank you Mr
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
sir in a multi-driver household uh who
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be acre the fine and the
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
points on their license or any driving
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
record for um a pattern of
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
misconduct thank you for your question
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question um and the
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
answer is it it's up to the enforcement
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
agency to enforce that um if they don't
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
have a a good line of sight on the on
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
the actual driver it probably works
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
against them they'll probably have to
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
filter that system so that they can do
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
it um uh you you did bring out one of
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
the problems that they have with the uh
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
with the other camera systems with the
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
third party they just give it based on
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
the on the license plate we don't want
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire we want it we want
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
driver thank you representative
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
hlin thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
being here so to follow up on
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
representative gon's question um what if
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
I'm driving a rental car or a company
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
car that's registered to an entity as
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
opposed to a
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
person thank you for that question
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
that's a very good one
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
um I'll be it'll be hard to enforce that
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would be
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
very hard to enforce this isn't the
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
catch all for everything it's just going
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
to be some help for police especially
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
when you got local people who are
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
consistent violators those are the
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
people they want to go after not the
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
visitor coming in a rental car um but
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
you're right that could that could be a
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
experience yeah follow up thank you um a
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
different is there a question of due
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
process on this if I go to court to
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
contest my ticket I can confront a
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
policeman who had pulled me over but I
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
camera another good question thank you
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
sir uh
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
well it would still have to come from an
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
officer this is only a tool the same
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing as if he's using a radar gun he
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
still had it's still an officer issuing
 
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.629 align:start position:0%
still had it's still an officer issuing
the

00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
summons I'll give you one more in that
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
one yep thank you U so a traffic camera
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
generally is mounted on a pole on the
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
street there is no officer involved
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
okay um actually I I have one just just
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
for clarity um you're saying that these
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
cameras not only can but should capture
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
not just the license plate but the
 
00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.389 align:start position:0%
not just the license plate but the
operator

00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
operator
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
also depends on which camera system they
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
use but uh if they have a good one yes
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anybody else from the
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative St
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair and uh good
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
morning I'm out at night I'm sitting at
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
a light for whatever reason it's
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
malfunctioning it will not change they
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
give me the green light I treat it as a
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
stop sign at that point and go through
 
00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:08.950 align:start position:0%
stop sign at that point and go through
it

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
safely now I'm going to get a ticket
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
from a machine that says I ran a red
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
light I've got no officer who stopped me
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
that I can explain it to on the spot and
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
they can either then they can make a
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
judgment right there I'm not going to
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
have to go to court at some cost either
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
through missed work uh get a lawyer
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
whatever uh what about what about that
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
situation thank you for the question
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative and uh first of all you
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
would probably be excused because you'd
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
have your motorcycle helmet on so they
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
you uh but it's it's not the machine
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
that's doing the that's record that's uh
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing the violation it the machine
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
is just being used as a tool to help
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
enforce especially with uh when we have
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
people that are are uh continued
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
violators it's not the catch all for
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
everything I don't know it could be a
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
catchall for a lot of things uh anybody
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
else from the committee seeing none
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you sir uh
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%

00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
hos I'm representing myself I'm also a
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
city counselor and Keen working with uh
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Jones as well um but we
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
23613 which governs uh Highway video
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
surveillance at this time um these uh
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
type of detection systems are used in at
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
least 19 States depending on where you
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
research you get different numbers um
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
but at least 19 states are using them
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
and and there's more coming every day as
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
I follow the news either uh local cities
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
or or other states coming on board um
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
they're typically used in places where
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
you're really concerned about the speed
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
or the red lights now you're not putting
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
them on every red light that would not
 
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
be cost effective whatsoever but you're
 
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
putting on them in places where you've
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
done a study to understand that they are
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
of value and they're typically also used
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
in school zones in hospital zones um in
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh and in particular they're used in
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
construction zones and construction
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
zones we all know is one of the most
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
hazardous uh job hazardous occupations
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
in America today a highway construction
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
worker is so much more likely to be
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
injured or killed uh and other
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
additional U controls of that would
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
always be welcome now there's right now
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
in um New Hampshire we have they're
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
prohibited from local jurisdictions to
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
deploy them and that's what we'd like to
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
amend but we allow them in so many
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
places already there's at least 10
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions here uh that uh allow uh
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
speed control cameras uh to regulate the
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
traffic uh uh movement the um also uh
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
the department of Department of
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation is allowed to operate
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
dash cameras in their Fleet now they're
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
not doing law enforcement work but
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
they're recording the data and uh
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring traffic as as these type uh
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
detection systems would do um there's
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
some typical uh regulations that go
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
along with
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
this and they're here
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere there they are uh so you know
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
first you do a needs analysis you know
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
if a local jurisdiction is authorized to
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
do this they have to do a needs analysis
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
which would then work with state do uh
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
to justify it um an annual report of all
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the detections records infractions
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
summonses and any fines that might be
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
generated could uh would be required and
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
and could be produced and made public
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
record um violations as a result of
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
detection would not exceed anything that
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
would be uh issued by usual police
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
detection uh violations in some states
 
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
don't result in points on an owner's
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
license it's recognized that this is
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
something something new and we're
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
exploring it and we you move into it
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
carefully but you don't make it any
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
worse than what might be there already
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
and as uh representative Jones mentioned
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
the vendors are only paid for the value
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the equipment there's never never a
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
performance uh uh reward for how many
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
detections they get um the uh you these
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
things are we're all familiar with
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
silent policemen or or even a cruiser
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
parked on the side of the road uh at the
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
effect the impact that that has this is
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
one more enhancement uh to those to that
 
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
abilities you know we all slow down when
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
we see those things
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
coming last things um I mentioned
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
construction zones so these really act
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
as a safety device uh and will help uh
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
reduce people's speed in in dangerous uh
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
areas and there also a law enforcement
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
safety device if we have some way to
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
lessen the number of of Troopers of
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
policemen have to stand on the side of a
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
a fast moving Road a busy highway uh and
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh stopping Speeders if we have other
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
ways to do that we're improving their
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
job safety and their job
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
performance thank
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you sir I just got one
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
question uh the bill says on line F five
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually four and five that systems May
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
shall be used for traffic enforcement
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
only uh I've heard from you and the
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that there there only
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
for certain things in traffic
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement and you've mentioned
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
yourself of several guard rails like uh
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
the needs assessment and and um studies
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
determining where and when uh Etc I
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
guess my question is where are all those
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
guard rails written down in the bill I I
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
I look to the committee to help develop
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
that I recognize this is a new step for
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislation and uh we we
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
need to explore how it could be done and
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure it would be great to have
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
whatever guard rails you want as long as
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
we can create the path for local
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to to do
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
this any other questions from the
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
committee thank you by the way represent
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
pyo thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
H for uh taking my question here you
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your testimony that there
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
are um exceptions or examples that we
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
have um detection cameras and Ed by the
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
state level um is there anything if you
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
could clarify that a little sure um
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
they're they're used on Bridges around
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Nashua
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
and it's it's listed in the existing
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
bill which I thought I had right there
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
it is um used on exit ramps and entrance
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh exit ramps off i93 and i8 9 they're
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
used uh they're authorized in any future
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
state-owned Park and Ride
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
facility uh and I mentioned the dot dash
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
cams um and and when you think about it
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
they're used by police dash cams already
 
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's the same type of uh situation
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
where we're using an electronic
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
detection device to record somebody's
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle may I ask a followup sir y
 
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.349 align:start position:0%
vehicle may I ask a followup sir y
follow

00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
um let's say there's a high traffic
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
intersection in a
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
municipality um is there something
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
stopping from the municipality appealing
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the state to put in detection cameras
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
there in their circumstance well uh
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um as as I read the existing
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm no lawyer here so uh
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
forgive me um the local jurisdictions
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
are strictly prohibited from deploying
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
any such detection
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
devices thank you other
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr chairman um could this
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
system be used in real time for example
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
you have multiple cameras at multiple
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
stop lights somebody runs a stoplight
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
the data is caught by the system but
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
live uh person at say police
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
headquarters who can then give that
 
00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
information to the police officer and
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
they can go pick him up in in real time
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
as opposed to later on by mail thanks
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
what a great question um first thing
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
comes to mind is I say yeah if you're
 
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
driving a Tesla I'm sure it could be
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
wired directly to shut your car off at
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
that time but I understand what you're
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
saying could it be reviewed that sure um
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
but that's a very labor intensive
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
operation I think we' uh we're putting
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
so much of the burden to uh justify
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
operate and then uh utilize the results
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
of these detections on the local
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction they have to want it really
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
bad and many actually do so um could
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
that happen sure if we want to pay for a
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer sitting there
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
watching this at all times more as far
 
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
as I understand other states that do it
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
um will you know review the detections
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
it it pops up on a beeper or something
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
and then it has to be reviewed because
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
if they're going to issue a summons uh
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
as representative Jones said it has to
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
be done by a law enforcement
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
official thank
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
you anybody else we do have somebody
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
from do here if it helps I don't know
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
what that question is representative St
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
um I I like what you said about uh you
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
put up signs now to warn people about
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
speed zones Etc is there anything to
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
prevent uh well say Keen from putting up
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
a sign that says uh traffic or speed
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
cameras in effect even though there's
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
not one there but just kind of put it up
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
there is like a this will get in the
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
slow down a little bit because I bring
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
this up because the city of Daytona
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
Beach in Florida had speed cameras
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere and they um they took them
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
down but they left all the signs up
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
which uh I think probably keeps people
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more honest so it's just
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
question yeah there always um I think uh
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
you go into retail stores and you see
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
security cameras and you wonder what are
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
they actually looking at um the um you
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
know that that is something that always
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
seems good uh until people figure it out
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
and it's doesn't take long I mean the
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
recent example was over in Chesterfield
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
on route nine where uh City uh parked an
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
empty police cruiser on the side of the
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
road and people were just jamming on
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
their brakes when they came up to see
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
that for a couple days and then he
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
realized there's nobody in the damn
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
moves oh represent
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
Sinclair but the outer Towners won't
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
know that thank you was there a question
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
there the Out of Towners won't know that
 
00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:42.470 align:start position:0%
there the Out of Towners won't know that
will

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
they uh I have one last one just getting
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
back to the actual language of the bill
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
um it says that municipality shall be
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
jointly and serly liable for any
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
unlockable operation of any camera
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
system again
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
and I should have asked the prime
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor but you've been working with him
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask you
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
um what does that look like or is that
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
also a charge of the committee to figure
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
out what that looks like no I I think
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's an open-ended statement that will
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
allow U the that we really lays it on
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
the individual municipality the
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to be responsible for the
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
operation and they'll be subject to all
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
the usual 91a uh requirements and um
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
obviously we know there'll be core
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
challenges it's a it's a heavy lift for
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
a municipality to engage this but um if
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
they really want to the state should
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
allow them to do
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
so anybody else seeing none we do have
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
one more speaker from the Department of
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you very much thank
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes Bill Lambert from
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation not taking a position on
 
00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:53.430 align:start position:0%
Transportation not taking a position on
the

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill good morning oh thank you Mr chair
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
my name is Bill Lambert I'm the highway
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
safety AC of Transportation
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Department of
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation and prior to that I spent
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
several years as a state traffic
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
engineer so the department is neutral on
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
the bill um I operate I put in the pink
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
card in case there's any technical
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
questions that I that I can try to help
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
out with um the one example I can get
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of similar to what I see in
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
the bill is uh the speed uh feedback
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
signs that a lot of you are probably
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with your speed is um we allow
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
those U by local Juris PRS on state
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
highways um but we get a lot of
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
variation how they deployed um vendors
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
will sell a lot of Technology they'll
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
promise a lot of things um but
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
delivering the technology isn't always
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
as efficient as we and consistent as we
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
would like so with that I'd be happy to
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions I'd also be happy if
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
questions not so
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
lucky seriously though um the cameras
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
that we currently allow whether it's the
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
ones that control red lights on the
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
telephone poles or at the tolls
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
collecting uh plate
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
information do we have any that collect
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
other than images of traffic or license
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
plates currently I mean because this one
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason I asked do we have any
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
that are intended to capture the
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
occupant couple different types of
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
cameras so uh the previous speaker
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um some of the security
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
cameras in this bridge security cameras
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh on the high level Bridge those kind
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
of went in with 91 911 the homeland
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
security issues um kind of a high
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation asset so those cameras
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
capture video um they're not uh high
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
resolution video but they capture video
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh and it's not of the highway
 
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:41.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's the structure itself
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
the um the toll evasion cameras are
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
strictly plate I think that's very
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
strictly regulated in the in the law
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
that we're only allowed to capture plate
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we only um site the owner of the
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle U so we don't identify who the
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
driver is um and then the traffic signal
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
detection that's simply technology to
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
allow us to to identify that as a
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle waiting we don't record any of
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
that video there's nothing captured
 
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
there that's just historically we've
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
used the inductive Loops in the pavement
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
um they're very hard to replace in the
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
winter time uh so we end up with traffic
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
signals with no detection for several
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
months until we can fix it um and while
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
that's reliable most of the time uh the
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the detection cameras allow us um to be
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
able to respond to a failed detection
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
rather immediately but there's no
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
recording of that that's the cameras
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
that I'm the 93 and 89 exit ramp cameras
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not familiar with what those
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
might be so I can't answer
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
that okay those are the parking ride
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
ones you're not sure on those park and
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
ride goes into the same security issue
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
as as the um the bridge cameras they're
 
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
there for security that's police video
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
um we can monitor it live to make sure
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing going on that we

time when a child of under the age of 16

is in the vehicle uh it calls for a $100

fine as a penalty and it is listed as a

Representative Steve Parson who is the
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
you transportation for once again
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
indulging me
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
legislation so House Bill 390 let me uh
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
let me paint the picture for you here in
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
and this all starts off with uh nothing
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
to do with firet trucks in 2007 we had a
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
create a car that looked an awful lot
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
like a cop car and he decided it would
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
be fun to pull women over and have
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
conversations with
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
them so looking through the statute at
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
the time they could not charge him with
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
that there was no prohibition
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to that with a with a
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle so the legislature in 2008
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
reacted and reacted quickly and when we
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
react quickly with legislation based on
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
events sometimes we make
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
mistakes so the legislature did is they
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
put a section into law that prohibited
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
and they used the term emergency
 
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.630 align:start position:0%
and they used the term emergency
vehicles

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
now following that event and following
 
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.150 align:start position:0%
now following that event and following
that

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
legislation the Department of Motor
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
Vehicles went with the interpretation of
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
intent on that and they did it for 16
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
years with no
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
issue now fast forward to around 9
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
months ago I get a call from a gentleman
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
in Salem who owns an antique fire engine
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
went down to the clerk to re-register as
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
he had done for the prior 20 years and
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
was told by the clerk now can't register
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
that anymore you can't have that on the
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
road so he said how do you figure out
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this I've had this thing
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years and she said new law
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
well now now there was no new
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
law so I get this call from from him and
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
others in that universe that owned
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
antique fire engines and said what the
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
heck is going on here so I called the
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
director of the DMV and asked that very
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
question well with the and I commend the
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
director of the Department of Motor
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
Vehicles in this in this Venture here in
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
the sense that he's he was relatively
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
new at the time and was literally going
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
through the statute looking section by
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
section to make sure his agency complied
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
with the law which which is great I wish
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
every state agency did
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
that but when it got to this point under
 
01:06:01.079 --> 01:06:02.870 align:start position:0%
that but when it got to this point under
strict

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
strict
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation he said well because of
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
the way it's written that's kind of how
 
01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.789 align:start position:0%
the way it's written that's kind of how
it

01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
is so we had a discussion about intent
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
and some of the absurdity of that and
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
what that actually translates
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
to and he said well there's also a
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
conflict in statute and there's another
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
section of Statute that allows for the
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
use of lights and sirens in parades I
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
said that's great but how you get the
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
parade so um so in discussions with the
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
um the chairman of both health and
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
Senate transportation in discussions
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
with uh some folks in that Universe I
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
said you know what we just we need to
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
fix this
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
so okay why does that matter and I'll
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
give you a great example of the
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
technicalities of the law if you're
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
going to be under strict interpretation
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
the town of Raymond a fire department I
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
actually worked for um has a 19 30 Maxum
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
it was purchased new by the town
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
literally in 1930 they've had it ever
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
since but in the 1980s the technical
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
ownership of that firetruck was
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
transferred to the Raymond historic
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
Association so under strict
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law because the
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle is not owned by a municipal fire
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
department they can't put it in parades
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
anymore 50 years that vehicle has
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
transported either Miss Raymond or Miss
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the town
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
parade but technically cannot do it now
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
to do it they would have to strip
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
everything off of it now I had a a
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
lovely lady at the Department of Motor
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
Vehicles say to me well you know you you
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
you have to take all the stuff off that
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
makes it a firet Tru and I said Well
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
ma'am I you know if we if you painted a
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
firetruck purple and you drove it down
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
the road people would go oh look at that
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's a purple firet truck it's a
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
utilitarian vehicle made for a purpose
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
unlike a cop car which is a Dodge
 
01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
Charger with stickers decals and license
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
plates that if you remove stickers decal
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
license plates it just goes back to
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
being a Dodge Charger well fire trucks
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
don't really do that so in working with
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles we kind
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
of came up with an idea of how we can
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
make this fit in here and make this work
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
so the legislation what that does is it
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
it puts retired fire apparatus under the
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
antique standard why first of all
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
they're antiques secondly because
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
antique vehicles cannot be used for
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
Commerce and that's kind of important
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
here because it is possible for someone
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
actually it has occurred As a treat
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
company in plastow that owns a retired
 
01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
ladder truck and they use it for tree
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
trimming purposes this bill does not
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
exempt them because they use it for
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
commercial purposes and therefore cannot
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
register it as an antique so what this
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
does is it puts the the retired fire
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
apparatus into the antique statute and
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
then what it does is under the
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
prohibition part it exempts them from
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
the requirements of having to strip the
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle down into nothing
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
now literally someone at the DMV told
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
this guy that he had to take a razor
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
blade to the side of his vehicle and
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
remove everything off of it no one is
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to take an antique and do that
 
01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
that that's the the absurdity of that is
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
I can't believe it came out of
 
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
somebody's mouth frankly but um having
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
been in this universe for a long time I
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
can tell you I can assure you we don't
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
have problems in New Hampshire with
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
people doing things with anti fire
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
engines they're not supposed to be it is
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
against the law for them to run on a
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
public road with sirens on it always has
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
been and it will continue to be and none
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
of them do it none of them risk that
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
this is a a very tight community ofo of
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
just historic people fire service
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
history people people that want to
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
preserve old fire
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
apparatus these these people are are
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
very proud of of what they do and
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
they're very cognizant of the damage
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
they can do to their Community we do not
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
have a problem in New Hampshire with
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
this so this is just a matter of
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
taking a strict interpretation of the
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
law tweaking it a little
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
bit and solving a problem before it
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
really becomes any
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
bigger and I'm absolutely open to
 
01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much any
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.270 align:start position:0%
questions from the
committee

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so we already
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire statute that
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
impersonating a law enforcement officer
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know is it covers using lights and
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
siren to pull somebody over uh and is a
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
felony and using emergency vehicle
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
lights and sirens is uh I believe a
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
major misdemeanor to do the same to move
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
somebody out of traffic this does not
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
affect those laws it simply says that
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to modify something for
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
the use of parades Etc so this
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely does not have anything to do
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
with police vehicles in any way shape or
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
form this is strictly just anti
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
fire engines
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
looking fire engines are not hard to
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
hide right they look like fire engines
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's this isn't a matter of going
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
well you know is what are we looking at
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
here it's a fire Tru right so this is
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
not this is not going to enable anybody
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
to do anything illegal it does not
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
change that portion of Statute in any
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
way shape or form and if someone has
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
ever successfully pull someone over in a
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
firet truck I'd like to meet him cuz
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a pretty impressive
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
event any other questions with committee
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative pataro um in developing
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
this bill uh you did find that using the
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
word apparatus is correct um re reason I
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
asked with fire departments and fire
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
apparatus I it could be anything it
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
um um chemical canisters or or what have
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
you I can't even imagine but I just
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I'm clear on that so
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
apparatus is an industry
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
term it's it's how um within the fire
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
service things are defined
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
and where where apparatus is important
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
in not using the term vehicle right
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
there are vehicles that are owned by the
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
fire fire departments that are not fire
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
apparatus they don't fight fire right so
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
the fire the city Fire Marshall in
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester driving around in his Chevy
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
that's not a fire apparatus so fire
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
apparatus is is important an important
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
distinction there in the sense that it
 
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
defines a vehicle in a certain
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
way follow up Sir follow up um you say
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
apparatus is an industry term are we
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
aware of any like description any other
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation for these sorts
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
of things no it doesn't I don't think
 
01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to get into the the other
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
parts of law where fire apparatus is
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
discussed it it's this is there's no
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
loophole here there's no it again
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
there the idea here is to is to
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
allow antique fire engines to continue
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
to do what they've been doing in the
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
state for a hundred years that that's
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
why that term has to be used it's not
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
for pickup trucks it's not for ancillary
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
staff cars those are not considered fire
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
apparatus by any municipality or fire
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
department so it's I I hate to use the
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
term common terminology but but that's
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
just that's really what that term means
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's a common terminology thank
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative Miller uh thank you chair
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question is
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
there a reason that we've specified a
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
different age for the fire apparatus
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
versus other antique Vehicles yes there
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
is is it just because this happened to
 
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
be the age of this one or is there
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
unlike cop cars that you will not see a
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
20-year-old cop car on the road in New
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they have rotten to dust okay
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the reason for 20 years is because
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
the service life of a fire engine in New
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now due to the crap that we
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
spray on the roads has dwindled down to
 
01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.990 align:start position:0%
spray on the roads has dwindled down to
18

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
years it used to be a lot longer than
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
that so 20 years was done for the sake
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
of how do we take a a fire engine that
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
has gone to municipal auction and
 
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
purchased by someone with the intent of
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
preserving it and now they sit in this
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
window where okay I've acquired this 20y
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
old 21y old fir Tru that's now no longer
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
being used and I have to park it out
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
back for five years waiting for the
 
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
antique standard to catch up to the
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
reality of what it is that's that's the
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
reason 20 years was chosen um and again
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
that was also in consultation with the
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
DM director
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
so any other questions from the
 
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative plemon thank
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you for Mr chair and thank you
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
for taking the question I just looking
 
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
for some clarification you you stated
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
that this is the fire apparatus not the
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
pickups um so what about like command
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
type Vehicles Hazmat Vehicles a lot of
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
fire departments have their own
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
ambulances all respond to fires and such
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
um would they they would not be in
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
included and then why not should they be
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
included so ambulances are not
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
specifically included in this because
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that your chairman will
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
will explain this to you in in exec
 
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
session but ambulances retired
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
ambulances are typically used by
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
contractors plumbers folks like that not
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
the intent here um you know you want to
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
into I mean the oh my gosh probably I'd
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
have to think of the newest preserved
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
ambulance I've ever seen for restoration
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
purposes is out of the 50s it it's just
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
not something that's that's done they
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
ambulance has ambulances haven't changed
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
the way they look since the 70s they're
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
just not something that's restored or or
 
01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
kept so ambulances were specifically not
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this because of the fact
 
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
again like I said the majority of them
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
that end up in private hands that have
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
survived past being rotten like are used
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
followup follow up what about the other
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
items I identified like Hazmat vehicles
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh C4 trucks command
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles yep those are um they're not a
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hazmat rig would be would fall under the
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
apparatus definition command Vehicles
 
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
would have to fall under the generic
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
antique standard they're not they're not
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
fire apparatus so they're not the intent
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is not to protect
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
those vehicles at all
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you sir
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair chair and I like to
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
recognize uh representative PRL who is
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill good morning Mr chairman and the
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh pretty much
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
ditto but I I heard uh something about
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
risking their apparatus doing something
 
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
illegal because when you pay lots of
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
money for it invest lots of money into
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
it to fix it back up to where it is you
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
do not want to risk it by doing
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
something stupid like driving down the
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
road with your lights and sirens on and
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
I can also attest that I've never heard
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
anybody doing that with one of their
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
antique fire trucks except in the parade
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
where it's supposed to happen so I would
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
really appreciate uh you passing this
 
01:17:59.470 --> 01:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
and ambulances were dealt with a few
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
years back still don't agree with that
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
and you may see me in here for those
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
because those need to be preserved as
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
well it's very true contractors use them
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
but there are also people who actually
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
like EMS who preserve those as well
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
because they're a part of our history uh
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
as well and with that if you have any
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
questions for me I'll take them but any
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
question very good any questions from
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
the committee going once going twice not
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
seeing any thank you so much thank you
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
guys I do not have anybody else who's
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
registered to speak so I'm going to
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
390 our next bill uh will be HB 419
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
about five
 
01:18:53.719 --> 01:19:23.709 align:start position:0%

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
windshield wipers are also on chair
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Jones Prime
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor welcome
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
chair once again representative Philip
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
3 I'm here today representing all of
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
your constituents all of your mothers
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
and fathers and daughters and sons and
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters anyone who drives
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I'm
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
here asking for four simple words added
 
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
to an
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.430 align:start position:0%
 
26631

01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
26631
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and I think in the fourth line down it
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
says and whenever windshield wipers are
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
are active that's the only four words
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
we're adding to that
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
RSA uh it's a difference between seeing
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who's 100 feet away or somebody
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's 900 feet away uh so it's for the
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
best of all of us uh as I said earlier
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not one per many words uh I did send
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
you all a an email about uh from the US
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
Transportation about survey that was
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
done uh first of all we would be joining
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
18 other states in having such a such a
 
01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
law uh the US do sent us information on
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
a survey done by The renir
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
Institute and what they did was they
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
took seven states that had those laws
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
they did a comparison of the same time
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
period before those States had the laws
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
and after and the difference
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
in those laws came out that there excuse
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.590 align:start position:0%
it it
was

01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
7% less accidents less fatal accidents
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
on inclement weather days after the law
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
was passed and 30% less at Dusk and Dawn
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the only scientific data I
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
could find but I think it's very
 
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
important to have
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
that and so it's very simple put your
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
put your lights on when your wipers when
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
your wipers are on that's all we ask and
 
01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
chair I just have one and I'm not trying
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
to be nitpicky about it but in terms of
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
enforceability know because I I see a
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
lot of these that could be done through
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
public education especially the the the
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
Billboards on the side of the road that
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
are programmable what is law enforcement
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
and how are they supposed to enforce
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
somebody that either has their
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
windshield wipers on low intermittent or
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
off because the way this is written if
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
they're off they don't need their
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
headlights but if it's on low
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
intermittent they would how do they tell
 
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.870 align:start position:0%
intermittent they would how do they tell
the

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
difference that's that's a very good
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
question I get low intermittent you're
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
still going to see the wiper go by
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
while again how do they know that's my
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
that was my question but thank you any
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
other otherwise they wouldn't enforce it
 
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
I guess you know any other questions
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
represent gon thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
you so this adding to an existing law on
 
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
on uh headlight usage you know dust Dawn
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
Etc is the intent in terms of
 
01:26:38.669 --> 01:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement that it would be the same
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
fine as inappropriate use of headlights
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
is it because it's kind of added on to
 
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
that so is that how it's enforcable yes
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
questions represent St
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you and thank you uh do you
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
have any idea of of the percentage of
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
how many vehicles are on the highway
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
where their lights are on all the time
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer I don't have that kind of
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
data but that just helps we wouldn't
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
enforce thank
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
pataro thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh in your estimation
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass and be law
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
would I be faced with a situation if I'm
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
driving up North and a dragon fly hits
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
my windshield and I use the wipers to
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
get it off and I could be breaking the
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
headlights well I think any enforcement
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
officer would have to use discretion
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
that you're right it could be just like
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
any any other law has could be with it
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
to that's correct I they'd have to use
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
discretion thank you
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
question welcome back to Transportation
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um I have two vehicles
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
that have a um a feature that um it
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
senses when there's moisture on the
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
window and it and it operates the
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
windshield wipers automatically um I
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
have no idea how I
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
would uh ever stop to make this work
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
with that kind of bill um do you have
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
any ideas how that would uh interfere or
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
work with your process on this
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislation well that's a very good
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the question um
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
yes it it could happen uh and my wife
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
does have a car that turns on the uh the
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
F minute Fields Mo uh moisture the uh
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
the what the wipers will go on once
 
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
again it's it's a discretion of the
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer plus I'm pretty sure
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you have that option you already have
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
your running lights on when you're when
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're driving because that that would
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
option represent
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
Johnson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question would daytime
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
running lights
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative that's a
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
very good question they I think the
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
headlights we could we could amend it to
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
saying uh running lights but I think uh
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically States headlights
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
because that's what in Clement weather
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's the one that makes the difference
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
between being 100 feet away or 900 feet
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
away thank
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
you representative pondon thank you Mr
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
question does do it the statement in the
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
legislation whenever rain snow and fog
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
shall interfere with the proper view of
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
the road does that not
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
clarify the terms when the windshield
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
wipers in conjunction with the headlight
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
should be on is that specifi it's kind
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
of specific to inclimate
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
weather thank you so that answers your
 
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
question I think I believe right sir
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
chair anybody else
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
representative pay you thank you Mr
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
question um so all these conditions
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
would have to be met in order for you to
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
be in violation of the law you're it
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be snow rain fog uh view
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
of the road person's Vehicles c not
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
clearly discernable at 1 th000 ft and
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
whenever windshield wipers are active so
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill all those
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
conditions would have to be
 
01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
met in
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that's the way
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
so and that answer some of the other
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
set okay that answers the dead bug
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
question anybody else from the committee
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.470 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
sir uh next up chair Rec
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
recognizes Edward hos from Kean
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
representing himself in support of the
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
bill looking for a mere two minutes
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
sir is it on now yeah
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
um higher visibility is so important in
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
any sorry if I can get you to introduce
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
yourself again just for the record
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
Edward hos Keen I'm also a city
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
councelor in Kean um in support of a
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
bill um higher visibility for
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
automobiles is so critical for road
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
safety um we motorcycles have that
 
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
already that they have their lights on
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
Modern cars have some combination of
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
headlight or running light not the
 
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
classic parking light that some of us uh
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
1970 car people are familiar with it's
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
not the parking lights with that first
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
Notch there is a setting that actually
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
illuminates the headlights early on um
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
the higher visibility is good not only
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
for the driver but for other vehicles
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
seeing that automobile I speak uh
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
experience as a cyclist and I have a
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
rearview mirror I can immediately see a
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
car from behind when he has the lights
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
on um I cannot see a car from behind
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
when he has no lights on he just Fades
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
into the woods so I I would uh in

state for when for example let's say and
 
03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use a low to moderate
 
03:07:42.670 --> 03:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
income person as an example because it
 
03:07:45.910 --> 03:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
exacerbates the issue drastically let's
 
03:07:50.070 --> 03:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
say a person is driving um and gets
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
T-boned or rear ended something that's
 
03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
not even their fault their car which may
 
03:07:56.510 --> 03:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
not have been a high dollar car to begin
 
03:07:58.830 --> 03:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
with is completely total the police
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
arrive on the scene the police call
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
their choice of towing company the
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
person has no choice in what towing
 
03:08:10.229 --> 03:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
company the police are going to use the
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
police have the towing company remove
 
03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:12.510 align:start position:0%
police have the towing company remove
the

03:08:12.510 --> 03:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:14.790 --> 03:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle um and then store the vehicle
 
03:08:17.190 --> 03:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
until the person can get it out current
 
03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
law says they have 14 days to claim it
 
03:08:20.990 --> 03:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
and they can get their personal
 
03:08:22.349 --> 03:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
belongings in the
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
meantime if that vehicle is totaled and
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
if there was no insurance since we don't
 
03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
require Insurance in the state to pay
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
for the cost of that Collision again it
 
03:08:33.229 --> 03:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
may not have even been that person's
 
03:08:35.790 --> 03:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
fault that person now has to pay the
 
03:08:38.429 --> 03:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
several hundred to the towing company
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
for removing the vehicle even though
 
03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
they had no say in which towing company
 
03:08:44.349 --> 03:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the storage fee even
 
03:08:45.990 --> 03:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
though they had did not have the ability
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
to have that vehicle taken to to their
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
own property or to a friend's property
 
03:08:51.870 --> 03:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
be to be stored so now they're looking
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
at several hundred even maybe
 
03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
approaching $1,000 depending on how long
 
03:08:58.110 --> 03:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
before they get back around if they've
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
been injured in the hospital it may have
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
been some time to get a total vehicle
 
03:09:06.030 --> 03:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
out of storage they do not have the
 
03:09:08.429 --> 03:09:08.439 align:start position:0%
ability to get that vehicle out of
 
03:09:11.229 --> 03:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
storage now in current law the towing
 
03:09:13.990 --> 03:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
company um gives them 14 days generally
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
with a few exceptions to get their
 
03:09:18.389 --> 03:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle until the towing company sells
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
the vehicle or sells it for scrap um to
 
03:09:23.469 --> 03:09:23.479 align:start position:0%
to recoup their
 
03:09:23.479 --> 03:09:24.990 align:start position:0%
to recoup their
costs

03:09:24.990 --> 03:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:09:28.670 --> 03:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but in the case of having someone not
 
03:09:30.990 --> 03:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
able to get that vehicle
 
03:09:34.630 --> 03:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
out the DMV can suspend your driver's
 
03:09:36.910 --> 03:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
license the driver's license that the
 
03:09:40.309 --> 03:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
state has sensibly given you by the
 
03:09:42.110 --> 03:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
virtue of that that you have shown that
 
03:09:44.670 --> 03:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
you are able to safely drive a vehicle
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
this is a permit we're given by the
 
03:09:48.070 --> 03:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
state a privilege were given because
 
03:09:50.030 --> 03:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
we've shown we are capable of driving a
 
03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle that we have the physical health
 
03:09:54.830 --> 03:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
and ability and the mental acuity to
 
03:09:57.229 --> 03:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
safely operate a vehicle and yet that is
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
removed from a person because they were
 
03:10:03.150 --> 03:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
not able to pay a private towing
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
company to exacerbate the situation most
 
03:10:09.990 --> 03:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
police departments use a favored towing
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
company who then charge more because
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
they can you don't have a choice it's
 
03:10:16.469 --> 03:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
not a free market where you get to
 
03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
choose which toe and company you want to
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
use you have to go through them so they
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
can kind of charge whatever they want
 
03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
and in fact when I was having my
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle tow this was not this
 
03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
situation it I my vehicle was just
 
03:10:31.469 --> 03:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
stalled on the road the police came by
 
03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
said hey you're on the side of the road
 
03:10:35.150 --> 03:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to call my preferred I was
 
03:10:37.630 --> 03:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
on the phone with my preferred mechanic
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
who was going to send his Towing vehicle
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
to come get my car and the my mechanic
 
03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
said don't let them use XYZ company CU
 
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
they will charge you three times what we
 
03:10:50.830 --> 03:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
will charge you what anyone charges you
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
they can because the police use them so
 
03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have a choice so now you have
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
a person who needs to get to work who is
 
03:11:02.670 --> 03:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
low to moderate income and needs to get
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
to work not only has their vehicle been
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
total but now you have removed the state
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
has removed their driver's license
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
because of a completely private debt
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
that they had no choice in in
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
acquiring so this bill is to Simply
 
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
remove that
 
03:11:19.630 --> 03:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
the towing company can recoup their
 
03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
costs by selling it for scrap or selling
 
03:11:24.670 --> 03:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
it if it's still drivable they can
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
recoup the cost the towing company
 
03:11:29.229 --> 03:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
chooses to to work with that police um
 
03:11:32.229 --> 03:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
department so they don't have to accept
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
those jobs they do because it's
 
03:11:37.990 --> 03:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
profitable for them to do so and um
 
03:11:40.510 --> 03:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
because of that I don't think it's fair
 
03:11:43.190 --> 03:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
to basically put people in effectively a
 
03:11:45.790 --> 03:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
debtor's prison where they can't even
 
03:11:47.710 --> 03:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
get to work
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
because we've removed their actual legal
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
ability to drive even though they've
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
they've shown they can operate their
 
03:11:55.150 --> 03:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle safely we've removed that
 
03:11:57.389 --> 03:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
ability because they owed a private
 
03:11:59.590 --> 03:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
company who they had no choice in having
 
03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
a debt
 
03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
with the police did it by
 
03:12:06.990 --> 03:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
force so the reason this came up that
 
03:12:09.790 --> 03:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
the way in which this came into law is
 
03:12:13.469 --> 03:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
we have an abandonment law saying that
 
03:12:16.269 --> 03:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
the uh DMV can essentially fine you if
 
03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
you abandon a vcle and then in that
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
definition of Abandonment they include
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
not picking up your car at a toe company
 
03:12:26.990 --> 03:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is not abandonment that's you not
 
03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
being able to afford to get it out of
 
03:12:33.229 --> 03:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
storage again with a company you had no
 
03:12:36.190 --> 03:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
choice in choosing and at a location you
 
03:12:38.469 --> 03:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
had no choice in because most people if
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
they have a choice will ask for not a
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
$100 a day storage somewhere that they
 
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
will have to find a way to get to that
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
plate location they would choose to have
 
03:12:50.229 --> 03:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
it tow to their parking space at their
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
home but that's not an option for them
 
03:12:55.030 --> 03:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
so they had no choice in the toe company
 
03:12:57.870 --> 03:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
no choice in the storage and yet we're
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
defining that as abandonment as if
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
somebody just got rid of their car on
 
03:13:04.030 --> 03:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
the side of the road I don't think it
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
was fair that we put that under the
 
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
definition of Abandonment and then
 
03:13:11.710 --> 03:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
allowed the DMV to revoke your license
 
03:13:14.190 --> 03:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
having been nothing but a good driver
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
revoke your license um on that basis
 
03:13:18.510 --> 03:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't afford for
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
that so the National Insurance crime
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau this is an organization for over
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
a 100 years has nationally gone after
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
insurance fraud um companies that have
 
03:13:33.150 --> 03:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
kind of prayed on and I this is a weird
 
03:13:34.510 --> 03:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
thing for me to say but prayed on the
 
03:13:36.910 --> 03:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
insurance industry by just basically
 
03:13:38.550 --> 03:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
milking insurance for as much as they
 
03:13:41.309 --> 03:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
can get they've identified predatory
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
towing companies they believe that our
 
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
current law um is allowing those towing
 
03:13:49.030 --> 03:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
companies to be predatory basically
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
using the government mechanism and the
 
03:13:52.469 --> 03:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
force of the government the strong arm
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the government to extort people into
 
03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
paying private Towing fees of exorbitant
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
amounts so the National Insurance crime
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau has logged in in support of this
 
03:14:09.389 --> 03:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
bill because they've identified uh
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
towing companies across the country that
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
have been predatory but specifically in
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are allowing them a
 
03:14:17.469 --> 03:14:17.479 align:start position:0%
legal way to extort customers into
 
03:14:20.910 --> 03:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
paying them so I've explained the
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
situation I've explained why the bill is
 
03:14:25.269 --> 03:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
the way it is um I will say that we can
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
go in and redefine if you if the
 
03:14:30.190 --> 03:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
committee so wanted to to amend Define
 
03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
the um to tweak the definition of
 
03:14:35.429 --> 03:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
Abandonment um which is a larger
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
definition that just includes this one
 
03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
thing but what I've done here is say
 
03:14:40.590 --> 03:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
look whatever you define as abandonment
 
03:14:43.870 --> 03:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
you can't revoke the license and um I
 
03:14:46.190 --> 03:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
think it's incredibly necessary to keep
 
03:14:48.269 --> 03:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
the the privil VES that we receive from
 
03:14:49.870 --> 03:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
the government and the workings and our
 
03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
our ability to interact with the
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
government separate from our private
 
03:14:55.110 --> 03:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
debts in fact I think this might be the
 
03:14:58.110 --> 03:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
only instance I know of where the
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
government one of the very few I'll say
 
03:15:02.190 --> 03:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
one of the very few instances I know of
 
03:15:03.870 --> 03:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
where the government will hold over your
 
03:15:06.070 --> 03:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
head a privilege that it gives to you
 
03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
based on your abilities to to do
 
03:15:12.269 --> 03:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
something um B will hold that privilege
 
03:15:14.670 --> 03:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
over your head on the basis that you owe
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
a private company that you had no choice
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
but to go into debt with
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
money so with that I'm happy to take
 
03:15:23.790 --> 03:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
questions oh I will say I've had two
 
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
constituents to whom this has happened
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
one was early when I first got elected
 
03:15:29.670 --> 03:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I didn't really understand what he
 
03:15:32.030 --> 03:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
was saying and then more recently this
 
03:15:33.710 --> 03:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
has come to my attention again so this
 
03:15:35.150 --> 03:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
is something that is actually being
 
03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
practiced in the real world and I will
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
agree with you that's not the first time
 
03:15:41.189 --> 03:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
I've heard of concerns and complaints
 
03:15:44.110 --> 03:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
about the towing system that we've got
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from the committee
 
03:15:46.399 --> 03:15:47.790 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from the committee
represent

03:15:47.790 --> 03:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
Taro thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:15:52.070 --> 03:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question could you
 
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate at all in this bill concerning
 
03:16:07.150 --> 03:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.469 --> 03:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
14 what when you say elaborate is there
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
something in particular you're pointing
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
to as problematic or needing
 
03:16:15.920 --> 03:16:18.030 align:start position:0%
to as problematic or needing
clarification

03:16:18.030 --> 03:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:16:22.630 --> 03:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
um if I may it's uh just uh what this
 
03:16:24.910 --> 03:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph does in effect I don't
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
understand if you you could enlighten
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
me mention of an offense under the
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
provision of this title a hearing where
 
03:16:34.750 --> 03:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
the driver's reasonable notice of the
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
03:16:39.389 --> 03:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
license for any for any cause not
 
03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited in the
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
previous so basically this was an
 
03:16:47.070 --> 03:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
existing paragraph and we're saying that
 
03:16:49.110 --> 03:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes you can you can go through the
 
03:16:52.429 --> 03:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
normal systems you just can't have um a
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
hearing where the notice is about the
 
03:16:56.750 --> 03:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
removal of the license that's not going
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
to be a factor for this particular thing
 
03:17:02.790 --> 03:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
because we are prohibiting it here in
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
263 okay thank you yeah and it may be
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
helpful too when we look at answering
 
03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions because it is a good one uh
 
03:17:10.510 --> 03:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to take and open up our
 
03:17:12.910 --> 03:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
books and actually look at the whole
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
26357 and then overlay this to what's
 
03:17:18.150 --> 03:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
current cuz now we just see a paragraph
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
versus the whole chapter a lot of times
 
03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
it answers itself any other questions
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent St Clair
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative um do you know of any
 
03:17:34.110 --> 03:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
other causes from bills from private
 
03:17:36.429 --> 03:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
companies that the DMV would pull a
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
license for non-payment none at all in
 
03:17:40.990 --> 03:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
fact I don't know
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere I mean you could get into like
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
say something like child support where
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
you kind of owe a private person but
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a different animal
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
altogether there's really I mean there's
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
leans on houses if you don't pay your
 
03:17:55.229 --> 03:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
contractor but that's it's still a
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
different animal altogether we don't
 
03:17:59.630 --> 03:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
this is again this is a privilege that
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
the state ostensibly bestows on a person
 
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
on the basis of they have proven they
 
03:18:05.790 --> 03:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
are safe to operate a vehicle on the
 
03:18:07.830 --> 03:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
road that is the only
 
03:18:11.070 --> 03:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
requirement and we are making that
 
03:18:13.269 --> 03:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
contingent on owing a private debt to a
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
private company that you had no choice
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
in going to debt with in fact the only
 
03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
people that had a choice was the police
 
03:18:21.389 --> 03:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
department at the time so there's
 
03:18:22.910 --> 03:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere else in law that I know
 
03:18:25.150 --> 03:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
that we do that whatsoever but certainly
 
03:18:26.429 --> 03:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
not with driver's
 
03:18:29.870 --> 03:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
licenses thank you further
 
03:18:33.229 --> 03:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you oh
 
03:18:33.239 --> 03:18:34.469 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you oh
representative

03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:36.830 --> 03:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
pondon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:18:38.990 --> 03:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking a question I'm
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
just trying to uh because I again it was
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
stated I don't have the whole RSA here
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to understand for example
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
at what point in the process would the
 
03:18:52.110 --> 03:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
towing SL Storage Company claim
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
ownership of the
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle in in most cases and they do
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
make uh extensions for people who are in
 
03:19:02.349 --> 03:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
cars like if you got like let's say you
 
03:19:05.309 --> 03:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
were in irq and you were um intoxicated
 
03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
and you got arrested that night or you
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
got I don't know if they make an
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
extension for based on the hospital if
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're in the hospital or not but for
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
most situations the tolling company has
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
14 days and if you don't clim claim the
 
03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle in 14 days which for some people
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
is a paycheck period right like they may
 
03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
not even have that money until the
 
03:19:28.269 --> 03:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
following paycheck anyway so you have 14
 
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
days to claim and if you don't claim now
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
you can take personal property out of
 
03:19:34.870 --> 03:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
the vehicle before then but if you don't
 
03:19:36.429 --> 03:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
claim the vehicle in 14 days they can
 
03:19:38.469 --> 03:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
sell the vehicle to recoup their costs
 
03:19:40.349 --> 03:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
and I guess it's a key point because I
 
03:19:42.750 --> 03:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
think maybe when we were defining
 
03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
abandonment in statute I can kind of see
 
03:19:49.269 --> 03:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
some towing company lobbying here going
 
03:19:51.150 --> 03:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
and this is all here saying or or
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
speculation on my part saying look how
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
do we get our money back if we don't
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
hold something over them but they can
 
03:19:59.349 --> 03:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
get their money back they can sell the
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle even if it's for scrap the cost
 
03:20:04.469 --> 03:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
of Steel right now is through the roof
 
03:20:07.990 --> 03:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
so they would certainly get the cost of
 
03:20:10.189 --> 03:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
the towing and the keeping it on their
 
03:20:11.950 --> 03:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
property for 14 days back they may not
 
03:20:15.429 --> 03:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
make a profit off of that so um I can
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
imagine that's how we end up with the
 
03:20:18.830 --> 03:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
wording that we currently have I don't
 
03:20:20.429 --> 03:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
know that any other state actually does
 
03:20:24.750 --> 03:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
it like this um but yeah 14 days in
 
03:20:27.150 --> 03:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
general is is how long you have which is
 
03:20:28.670 --> 03:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
not an exorbitant amount of time for
 
03:20:30.870 --> 03:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
them to hold something quick
 
03:20:35.469 --> 03:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
followup followup um so in in in your
 
03:20:38.910 --> 03:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
scenario of a total vehicle would would
 
03:20:41.830 --> 03:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
it protect a citizen to utilize the
 
03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
option of signing over the the total
 
03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle to the yard within that 14 days
 
03:20:51.229 --> 03:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
and thus not we owe these monies is that
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
a viable option it's only viable if the
 
03:20:56.429 --> 03:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
towing compan is willing to do that okay
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
I think again the towing companies in
 
03:21:02.110 --> 03:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
question largely are the ones that
 
03:21:04.110 --> 03:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
operate in hand inand with the police
 
03:21:06.710 --> 03:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
departments and they like my for my
 
03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
example when my my vehicle was dead on
 
03:21:11.469 --> 03:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
the side of the road um my mechanic was
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to charge through my AAA 100 bucks
 
03:21:16.670 --> 03:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
it was only you know just like a couple
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
miles away the one that the police were
 
03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
going to go through which didn't accept
 
03:21:24.910 --> 03:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
AAA um was $300 something dollar so they
 
03:21:26.670 --> 03:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
can do that because the police are
 
03:21:30.429 --> 03:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
giving them basically forcible customers
 
03:21:32.550 --> 03:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
I don't the police told me unless you're
 
03:21:34.349 --> 03:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
tow truck gets here first I'm not
 
03:21:36.910 --> 03:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
waiting the my guy is going to take it
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
and that's what they do in an accident
 
03:21:39.870 --> 03:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
situation even if it's off to the side
 
03:21:42.790 --> 03:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
of the road they still use their own now
 
03:21:45.630 --> 03:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
if they know they're going to sell like
 
03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah if they'll if sign over the vehicle
 
03:21:50.469 --> 03:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
that's totaled and um they're going to
 
03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
get $600 in scrap for it versus I owe
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
them a
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
$1,500 they they're going to try to get
 
03:22:00.630 --> 03:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
their money out of me knowing that the
 
03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
state will suspend my license and I have
 
03:22:03.160 --> 03:22:05.349 align:start position:0%

n I've been in New Hampshire good
 
03:23:09.790 --> 03:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon sir how are you good I guess
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
I've been in New Hampshire resident
 
03:23:13.710 --> 03:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
since 1984 and I've been in New Market
 
03:23:13.720 --> 03:23:15.229 align:start position:0%
since 1984 and I've been in New Market
since

03:23:15.229 --> 03:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:23:20.070 --> 03:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
1986 um my son my oldest son got in an
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
accident in Portsmouth approximately a
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
quarter of a mile from his
 
03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
home the car got towed to a tow yard in
 
03:23:32.520 --> 03:23:34.670 align:start position:0%
home the car got towed to a tow yard in
Portsmouth

03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
03:23:39.150 --> 03:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
and my son was raising two little girls
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
with their mother in a rented mobile
 
03:23:47.790 --> 03:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
home and for him at $12 an hour life was
 
03:23:50.269 --> 03:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
pretty tough to begin with so then he
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
lost the vehicle that he got in the
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
accident with and then they took away
 
03:23:55.950 --> 03:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
his driver's
 
03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
license my son has not had a driver's
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
license since
 
03:24:06.030 --> 03:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:09.189 --> 03:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
law so I'm the one that brought this to
 
03:24:11.150 --> 03:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
the attention of
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
Ellen I don't think it's right that
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
anybody should have the ability
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
he had a rather well-paying job prior to
 
03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
that but then when he got his license
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
taken away he could only walk to work
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
and he had limited choices you know
 
03:24:31.150 --> 03:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
pumping gas washing cars he ended up at
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
an oil changing location and you know
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
those jobs are 12 13 $15 an hour how was
 
03:24:42.189 --> 03:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
he supposed to pay the
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
$1,500 back to the towing yard at $12 an
 
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
girls so I just don't I think it's not
 
03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
right and then and then he asked to get
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.990 --> 03:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
that so almost set thank you I got a
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
question for you so what happened with
 
03:25:07.790 --> 03:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
the vehicle did the towing company sell
 
03:25:09.870 --> 03:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
it and yes they did sold it for scrap
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay and so do you have any idea if they
 
03:25:14.469 --> 03:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
got more or less than what was owed on
 
03:25:16.349 --> 03:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
the oh I'm sure they got less I'm sure
 
03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
sure they got less okay because you know
 
03:25:21.070 --> 03:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
back then it the scrap was like 5600
 
03:25:23.950 --> 03:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
bucks but the the storage fees had gone
 
03:25:27.550 --> 03:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
up the last time I looked was
 
03:25:31.389 --> 03:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
$1,500 that was 9 years ago that was
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
2016 okay and my kid hasn't had a
 
03:25:36.189 --> 03:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
driver's license since then okay I'm
 
03:25:37.189 --> 03:25:37.199 align:start position:0%

03:26:39.790 --> 03:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
one I would have liked to have heard
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Motor
 
03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
Vehicles uh is there anybody here from
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%

sure just again for the record alen Reed
 
03:27:30.670 --> 03:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 and I failed to mention
 
03:27:32.670 --> 03:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
that this would also reinstate the
 
03:27:34.429 --> 03:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
licenses for anyone who's had their
 
03:27:38.070 --> 03:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
license revoked on this cause solely on
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
this cause so anyone who's currently
 
03:27:41.429 --> 03:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
without a license would get their
 
03:27:44.189 --> 03:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
license back if this passes as written
 
03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:46.199 align:start position:0%

03:31:22.349 --> 03:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:31:24.389 --> 03:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan ve I represent Hillsboro
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
34 in Amherst uh thank you for the
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present HB 439 which
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
seeks to end the suspension of driver's
 
03:31:33.030 --> 03:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
licenses for non-driving related
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
violations this bill is about fairness
 
03:31:37.070 --> 03:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
economic mobility and ensuring that our
 
03:31:38.830 --> 03:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
traffic laws focus on Public Safety
 
03:31:40.030 --> 03:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
rather than debt
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
collection right now thousands of New
 
03:31:43.550 --> 03:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents lose their driver's
 
03:31:45.990 --> 03:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
license every year not because because
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
of unsafe driving but because they were
 
03:31:48.870 --> 03:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
unable to pay court fines or
 
03:31:50.750 --> 03:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
administrative fees unrelated to any
 
03:31:53.349 --> 03:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle offense let me be clear
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is not about letting dangerous
 
03:31:56.910 --> 03:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
drivers off the hook this bill does not
 
03:31:58.510 --> 03:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
change any existing laws regarding
 
03:32:00.670 --> 03:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
license suspension for DUI reckless
 
03:32:02.670 --> 03:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
driving or other public safety
 
03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
violations it only applies to cases
 
03:32:06.030 --> 03:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
where a person's license is suspended
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
solely due to the inability to pay a
 
03:32:10.110 --> 03:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
financial penalty that has nothing to do
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
with their driving behavior the simple
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
truth is taking away a person's ability
 
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
to drive because of unpaid fines makes
 
03:32:17.870 --> 03:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
it harder for them to work support their
 
03:32:20.349 --> 03:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
families and pay off their debt instead
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
of helping people get back on their feet
 
03:32:23.550 --> 03:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
we're pushing them further into a cycle
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
of economic hardship license suspensions
 
03:32:29.550 --> 03:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
trap people in a cycle of poverty many
 
03:32:32.670 --> 03:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
people need their cars to work if they
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
can't drive they may lose their job if
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
they lose their job they fall further
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
behind on their fines and other bills a
 
03:32:41.349 --> 03:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
2019 study by the American Association
 
03:32:43.269 --> 03:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicle administrators found
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
that 75% of suspended drivers continue
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
to to drive not because they want to
 
03:32:49.030 --> 03:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
break the law but because they have no
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
other way to get to work medical
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
appointments or care for their
 
03:32:54.910 --> 03:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
families suspensions for non-payment
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't improve Public Safety the current
 
03:32:58.429 --> 03:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
law treats an inability to pay a fine
 
03:33:00.670 --> 03:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
the same as a reckless driving or DUI
 
03:33:02.910 --> 03:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
offense even though they have nothing in
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
common license suspensions should be
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
used for Dangerous drivers not as a tool
 
03:33:09.630 --> 03:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
for debt collection the burden falls
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
disproportionally on lower income
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
residents wealthier individuals can pay
 
03:33:16.429 --> 03:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
Their fines immediately while lower
 
03:33:18.429 --> 03:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
income individuals struggle leading to a
 
03:33:21.309 --> 03:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
suspension and a downward spiral studies
 
03:33:23.830 --> 03:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
from states that have ended debt based
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
suspensions such as California and
 
03:33:27.030 --> 03:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
Virginia show that removing these
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
suspensions allows more people to work
 
03:33:31.349 --> 03:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
pay their debts and contribute to the
 
03:33:33.670 --> 03:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
economy some may ask doesn't the state
 
03:33:35.309 --> 03:33:35.319 align:start position:0%
get generate revenue from the
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
suspensions yes legislative budget
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
assistant estimates that HB 439 will
 
03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
result in a revenue decrease of about
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
$955,000 per year due to l reinst fees
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
which is a lot of reinstatement
 
03:33:52.229 --> 03:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
fees however in consider these factors
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
administrative cost offset revenue
 
03:33:55.469 --> 03:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
losses the DMV processes tens of
 
03:33:56.830 --> 03:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of license suspensions each
 
03:33:58.990 --> 03:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
year a significant administrative burden
 
03:34:00.750 --> 03:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
by ending non-ri driver related
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
suspensions DMV will save time and
 
03:34:04.389 --> 03:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
resources allowing them to focus more on
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
pressing traffic safety concerns keeping
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
people employed boosts economic growth
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
when people lose their jobs due to
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
license suspension they may end up on
 
03:34:14.189 --> 03:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
public assistance which increases State
 
03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
costs keeping people licensed and
 
03:34:17.710 --> 03:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
working means they contribute to the
 
03:34:19.070 --> 03:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
economy pay Their fines and support
 
03:34:20.429 --> 03:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
their families a better long-term
 
03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
Financial outcome for the state New
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not alone in this reform
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're not the first state to consider
 
03:34:28.269 --> 03:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
ending debt based drivers Su license
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
suspensions California Virginia Montana
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
and West Virginia have already limited
 
03:34:33.550 --> 03:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
license suspensions for unpaid fees
 
03:34:34.870 --> 03:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts have taken
 
03:34:36.189 --> 03:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
similar steps to ensure that driver's
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
licenses are suspended only for traffic
 
03:34:40.510 --> 03:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
safety violations these states have seen
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes including more people
 
03:34:43.110 --> 03:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
staying employed and repaying their
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
debts without compromising Public Safety
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
HB 439 is a common sense reform that
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
ensures license suspensions are used to
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
promote Public Safety and not punish

representative
 
03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not adverse to this uh just to
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
preface I represent Nashua uh density
 
03:35:15.239 --> 03:35:16.389 align:start position:0%
preface I represent Nashua uh density
populated

03:35:16.389 --> 03:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
populated
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
municipality and uh we've got strict
 
03:35:19.279 --> 03:35:20.790 align:start position:0%
municipality and uh we've got strict
non-moving

03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
non-moving
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
violations with this
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislation the current action from what
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
I see from inner city is a complete
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
disregard of non-moving
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
violations uh ripping up tickets so
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
on what recourse would there be for the
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
person that continually blocks a hydrant
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
or driveways on a continual basis rips
 
03:35:49.590 --> 03:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
up the tickets what recourse is there to
 
03:35:53.309 --> 03:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
correct this action if we this if our
 
03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
current legislation is not in
 
03:35:58.030 --> 03:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
place you want the penalty be to be
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
consistent with the violation you would
 
03:36:02.590 --> 03:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
I can't say what would be the best I'm
 
03:36:03.870 --> 03:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'd have to research that kind
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
of violation but I suppose Towing their
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
car and uh going into debt Collections
 
03:36:12.030 --> 03:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
and other u means like that would be the
 
03:36:15.389 --> 03:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
best process um suspending somebody's
 
03:36:15.399 --> 03:36:16.469 align:start position:0%
best process um suspending somebody's
life

03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
for non-driving violations is you know
 
03:36:22.590 --> 03:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
like I said it creates a a poor cycle
 
03:36:25.389 --> 03:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
and it's punishes people for things that
 
03:36:27.150 --> 03:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
aren't related to to the crime they
 
03:36:27.160 --> 03:36:29.630 align:start position:0%
aren't related to to the crime they
committed

03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
committed
 
03:36:33.150 --> 03:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair any other
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%

03:36:37.790 --> 03:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
03:36:41.550 --> 03:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
does this bill um have any overlap with
 
03:36:44.830 --> 03:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
the bill we just heard HB 414 FN not
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
directly this this um has more to do
 
03:36:51.630 --> 03:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
with unpaid unrelated fines for uh that
 
03:36:53.070 --> 03:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
for other things other than motor
 
03:36:53.080 --> 03:36:53.950 align:start position:0%
for other things other than motor
vehicle

03:36:53.950 --> 03:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:36:56.349 --> 03:36:56.359 align:start position:0%

03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
unpaid fines uh license suspension for
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
defaulting on court payments um fines
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
for for violations in other states for
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
elating fines that you know maybe in
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Maine or somewhere else
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the country that has reciprocity with
 
03:37:09.760 --> 03:37:12.429 align:start position:0%

03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:37:36.469 --> 03:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
question so when am am I to assume that
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
when a suspension takes place the final
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
Arbiter of that is the
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
DMV the DMV receives some sort of notice
 
03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:49.399 align:start position:0%
that the license holder is in debt and
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
thus they suspend the license yeah I I
 
03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
imagine there's some kind of a process
 
03:37:57.750 --> 03:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
that comes down from the courts um that
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
allows a DMB to execute that that order
 
03:38:02.349 --> 03:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
to suspend the license I don't know if
 
03:38:04.670 --> 03:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
they have the discretion on their own
 
03:38:08.110 --> 03:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
may may I re ask the question did I you
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
can modify it I mean um in other words
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
it would only be the courts that is
 
03:38:17.670 --> 03:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
sending the DMV these notices right okay
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will help you represent
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
pataro this is similar to House Bill 650
 
03:38:25.469 --> 03:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
from last year we've been told that it's
 
03:38:28.269 --> 03:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
been used at the very last resort as a
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
very last resort but we will once again
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
try to get some testimony from the
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
Department of motive vehicles on this as
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
well any other questions representative
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
chairman do you have any uh any numbers
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative on
 
03:38:48.990 --> 03:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh how many license suspensions are
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
current uh due to non-payment of other
 
03:38:55.870 --> 03:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
fines uh I don't have it directly
 
03:38:57.910 --> 03:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
accessible accessible to me right now
 
03:39:02.189 --> 03:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
but uh I believe it's over 14,000 a year
 
03:39:02.199 --> 03:39:04.389 align:start position:0%
but uh I believe it's over 14,000 a year
license

03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
suspensions thank you anybody
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
else representative Hill thank you Mr
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
question um I'm assuming the process is
 
03:39:20.790 --> 03:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
there a hearing um uh is it left up to
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
the director is there any leeway or is
 
03:39:27.870 --> 03:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
this a uh a a mandatory um suspension
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about I I think once
 
03:39:32.670 --> 03:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
it comes down from the court it's it's
 
03:39:34.670 --> 03:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory for the DMV to follow through
 
03:39:38.590 --> 03:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
you all right anybody else seeing none
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%

I uh representative a um covered a lot
 
03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
of what I uh I was going to talk about
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh not surprisingly um and I have I
 
03:40:26.590 --> 03:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
think it's been circulated written
 
03:40:29.550 --> 03:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
testimony on this so I I want to
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
emphasize uh a couple things really
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh to address
 
03:40:38.550 --> 03:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to butcher your
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
name but
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
pandon ah not
 
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
that um to answer your question um there
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
are other as I as I addressed in my
 
03:40:48.880 --> 03:40:50.670 align:start position:0%
are other as I as I addressed in my
written

03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:40:53.550 --> 03:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
testimony there are other mechanisms
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
already in place for one people who are
 
03:40:59.590 --> 03:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
have not paid their fine or have failed
 
03:41:02.990 --> 03:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
to pay their fine and two separately for
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
people who have not shown up for court
 
03:41:06.510 --> 03:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
for people who have not shown up for
 
03:41:10.189 --> 03:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
court uh the bail system under 597 uh
 
03:41:14.429 --> 03:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
col 7 uh we've been working on that for
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
a number of years to deal with failures
 
03:41:20.510 --> 03:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
to appear and it's a much more targeted
 
03:41:23.630 --> 03:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh way of dealing with people who
 
03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
don't show up for court um it and it you
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
know the mechanisms that are there um
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
are are better than suspending
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's license uh for the obvious
 
03:41:40.830 --> 03:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
reason of uh to be a little snarky about
 
03:41:42.990 --> 03:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
it um really doesn't make sense to
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
suspend someone's license and make it
 
03:41:46.710 --> 03:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
harder for for them to show up for court
 
03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
by not having a license um uh and uh the
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
same the same is true with suspending uh
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's license for a failure to pay
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
a fine at least with a certain group of
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
people those who uh what I identify in
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
my written testimony those people who
 
03:42:06.990 --> 03:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
who don't even have the luxury of living
 
03:42:10.110 --> 03:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
paycheck to paycheck um suspending their
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
license for not paying a fine that they
 
03:42:15.229 --> 03:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
may be struggling to pay makes it harder
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
for them to go to a job makes it harder
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
for them to go to a job interview um
 
03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's in that sense it's it's like
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
using a sledgehammer when an actual
 
03:42:28.510 --> 03:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
Hammer would work and and and as I
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
described the bail system is there it's
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
a very well uh developed system AKA
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
hammer for people who don't show up for
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
court for people who don't pay their
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
fine uh there is uh what what was put in
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
place uh maybe five years ago or so um
 
03:42:47.920 --> 03:42:49.149 align:start position:0%
place uh maybe five years ago or so um

testimony that is a mechanism where the
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
court can call into court somebody who
 
03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
has failed to pay a fine and they can
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
appoint them a lawyer uh and then they
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
can they they're notified that if they
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
that the hearing is whether they can
 
03:43:14.110 --> 03:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
afford to pay their fine or not whether
 
03:43:16.870 --> 03:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
they have an ability to pay their fine
 
03:43:19.149 --> 03:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
if the court finds that they have an
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
ability to pay the fine and haven't paid
 
03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
their fine then the court can jail the
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
person uh at the rate of $100 a day uh
 
03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
until their fine is quote unquote paid
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
off uh if the court finds that they do
 
03:43:37.750 --> 03:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to pay the fine uh
 
03:43:41.349 --> 03:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
then the court can uh try other
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
mechanisms they can uh try an extended f
 
03:43:48.870 --> 03:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
payment uh process they can suspend the
 
03:43:51.910 --> 03:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
fine uh that that it can be worked
 
03:43:54.750 --> 03:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
through uh with the court how to deal
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
with somebody who is in has a financial
 
03:43:59.469 --> 03:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
condition um that really doesn't allow
 
03:44:03.309 --> 03:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
them to pay the fine um uh again that's
 
03:44:07.110 --> 03:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
a very effective Hammer um and rather
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
than this uh license suspension which is
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
a sledgehammer that's ill directed now
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
the legislation very
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
clearly identifies that this doesn't
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
apply to the majority the most moving
 
03:44:25.790 --> 03:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
violations uh representative Miller uh
 
03:44:28.110 --> 03:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
had had a brief chat with him uh before
 
03:44:32.910 --> 03:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
he left um and he he raised a uh a
 
03:44:34.710 --> 03:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
moving violation that didn't seem to be
 
03:44:36.670 --> 03:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
included I'm more than willing to work
 
03:44:38.830 --> 03:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
with the uh with the committee and
 
03:44:40.990 --> 03:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
represent of Miller in particular if
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
anybody thinks there are moving
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
violations that should be included in
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
addition the ones that are already here
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
the more serious moving violations more
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
than willing uh to work with the
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh on that I will also note
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
um that uh I spoke with a uh I I
 
03:45:03.790 --> 03:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
communicated with a representative from
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh Americans for Prosperity uh Sarah
 
03:45:09.630 --> 03:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
Scott uh and they are supportive I think
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
they've identified their support online
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
she was unable to be here she has the
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
flu uh but they supportive of of HB
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
439 um uh I think again it's it makes
 
03:45:22.239 --> 03:45:25.269 align:start position:0%
439 um uh I think again it's it makes
sense

03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
to change the system to the extent we're
 
03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:30.229 align:start position:0%
to change the system to the extent we're
not

03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:45:32.349 --> 03:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
using license
 
03:45:36.030 --> 03:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
suspension for areas where there's other
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place number one and
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
number two where license
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
suspension in a in a sense contradicts
 
03:45:47.950 --> 03:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
what we want to have happen uh we want
 
03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
people to pay Their fines so we want
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
them to go to work uh we want people to
 
03:45:55.030 --> 03:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
show up for court so we wanted to have a
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
car um it in that sense it's time
 
03:46:03.510 --> 03:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
to reduce our Reliance on license
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
suspension as the qall to getting things
 
03:46:09.550 --> 03:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
to happen um you know I historically the
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
court system has used the you know they
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
send out a letter and threaten PE the
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
people who haven't paid their fine if
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
you don't pay your fine we're going to
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
suspend your license and that they get
 
03:46:23.790 --> 03:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
some response on that not understandably
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
but they can now send it they they
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
haven't but they could easily send out a
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
letter said if you don't pay your fine
 
03:46:30.670 --> 03:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a hearing to decide
 
03:46:32.910 --> 03:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
whether you serve your fine off at $100
 
03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
a day I mean that's as good a threat as
 
03:46:39.309 --> 03:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
license suspension um and it's still uh
 
03:46:42.429 --> 03:46:42.439 align:start position:0%
it it it it protects those who really do
 
03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
have financial difficulty um
 
03:46:48.750 --> 03:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh more than willing to take
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you would you believe I
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
think I'd rather lose my LC to go to
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
jail working up 100 bucks a day but
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's just me well you know I've I had
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
um people uh I used to be a public
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
defender and and uh some people would
 
03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
rather pay off their fine by at back
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
then it was 50 bucks a day so it people
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
make interesting choices question for
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
you you said uh RSA 604
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
a2f U did you say it was recently ified
 
03:47:20.349 --> 03:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
and used more uh that was uh
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
past boy seven or eight years ago long
 
03:47:25.389 --> 03:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
ago okay and I because where I was going
 
03:47:28.830 --> 03:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
with this is if they're relying more on
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
604 how many times is the suspension
 
03:47:33.870 --> 03:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
actually been used since then so I I
 
03:47:35.590 --> 03:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't know I haven't been we haven't
 
03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
been able to it's hard to my
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
understanding and I won't speak for
 
03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles but my understanding is
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to separate at out what the
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
license suspensions were I and something
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
I forgot to say I will also note there's
 
03:47:53.070 --> 03:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
a bill pending in front of house
 
03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
criminal justice of which I'm a member
 
03:48:01.149 --> 03:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
um to give Motor Vehicles more time M
 
03:48:03.389 --> 03:48:03.399 align:start position:0%
vle Department Department of Safety more
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
time to uh for people to pay Their fines
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
right now it's a maximum of 30 days but
 
03:48:11.680 --> 03:48:12.349 align:start position:0%
right now it's a maximum of 30 days but
the

03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill extends that to 90 days um so
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's this is a a multi-pronged effort
 
03:48:23.229 --> 03:48:23.239 align:start position:0%
to to to to find some other mechanisms
 
03:48:26.269 --> 03:48:26.279 align:start position:0%
to address a real problem fair enough
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the

willing to work on something to add
 
03:48:59.870 --> 03:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
non-moving violations no to add apparent
 
03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative Miller identified a
 
03:49:04.750 --> 03:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
another moving violation that wasn't
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
included on the list uh in uh
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
439 um uh uh which was unintentional on
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
439 talks about um RSA

26579 26582 Etc has that list those are
 
03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
all moving violations uh relate to
 
03:49:26.309 --> 03:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
moving violations and representative
 
03:49:29.149 --> 03:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
Miller identified another uh passing a
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
school bus that is a moving violation
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's not on that list and we're more
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
if anybody can think of any other moving
 
03:49:38.790 --> 03:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
violations not included on the list in
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
HB 439 that should be added more more
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%

committee
some

03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:51:49.870 --> 03:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
guys thank you Mr chair ma'am so I know
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
of a case where somebody had a violation
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
they got mailed their their fine or
 
03:51:56.710 --> 03:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
their court hearing didn't get it in the
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
mail and then the next time they even
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
found out about it it was when they were
 
03:52:03.510 --> 03:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
being arrested for driving with under a
 
03:52:06.630 --> 03:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
suspended license um I guess my question
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
is what is the requirement to ensure
 
03:52:11.070 --> 03:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
that somebody has been notified before
 
03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
their license is revoked and a bench
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
warrant is put out
 
03:52:18.189 --> 03:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
are you so to clarify the question are
 
03:52:21.630 --> 03:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
you speaking of citations served in hand
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
or Court's
 
03:52:26.149 --> 03:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
notification uh either or both in this
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
case the citation was served by hand and
 
03:52:30.590 --> 03:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
then and then you know the guy basically
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
put the citation down on a thing and
 
03:52:34.870 --> 03:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
forgot about it and you know what what's
 
03:52:36.510 --> 03:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on to notify people even if
 
03:52:38.149 --> 03:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's a Serb
 
03:52:40.750 --> 03:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
notification if it is a served enhanced
 
03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
um citation there's instructions on the
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
back of the citation of how to address
 
03:52:48.670 --> 03:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
um how you can pay or enter a plea of
 
03:52:52.590 --> 03:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
not guilty um after 30 days of unpay
 
03:52:55.630 --> 03:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
that citation does go into a default of
 
03:52:58.349 --> 03:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
which a notice of default is sent with
 
03:53:01.149 --> 03:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
the fee including the $50 administrative
 
03:53:03.309 --> 03:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
fee that's assessed at that time along
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the date of suspension um if no
 
03:53:09.269 --> 03:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
action is no plea is entered on that
 
03:53:12.510 --> 03:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
citation and um no other notices will be
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
sent after that notice of default so DMV
 
03:53:18.429 --> 03:53:18.439 align:start position:0%
mails to the record the the address
 
03:53:21.309 --> 03:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.319 --> 03:53:24.269 align:start position:0%
 
file

03:53:24.269 --> 03:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
file
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
sir you got follow up thank you so if
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
somebody's license is suspended they're
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
notified One Time by mail and they don't
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
get it for some reason have we just

04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
second by was that representative Hill
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
sure representative Hill K to speak to
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
your motion sir I do thank you um when
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony on this bill we we
 
04:23:10.990 --> 04:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
listened and heard from the
 
04:23:13.830 --> 04:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
DMV and they basically said that this
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill already the companies already have
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
the capability that this bill is
 
04:23:21.630 --> 04:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
proposing um and that that's that the
 
04:23:24.510 --> 04:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill really doesn't change anything so
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
based on that I just don't think this
 
04:23:29.550 --> 04:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
bill is really necessary so that's why I
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
think we should itl this
 
04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else from the
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%

motion I see representative
 
04:25:58.750 --> 04:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
gon I Motion in expedient to legislate
 
04:26:00.510 --> 04:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
182 uh in expedient to legislate is the
 
04:26:05.790 --> 04:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
motion is there a second
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
represent Miller times says
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
second I had to do it care to speak to
 
04:26:16.830 --> 04:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
your motion sir yes
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
sir so the biggest issues that I had
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
with this bill is it's written come down
 
04:26:23.590 --> 04:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
to a couple of things one of them is
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
encroachment into private properties um
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
private businesses and Private Affairs
 
04:26:31.590 --> 04:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
um there are companies major Employers
 
04:26:33.109 --> 04:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the state who spent millions of
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
dollars to put charging stations in
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
their own garages and for us to pass a
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
law that tells them that that investment
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
is a bad investment is a move Point um
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's an encroachment on their
 
04:26:46.750 --> 04:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
rights as Property Owners if there are
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
products being given to the market that
 
04:26:51.309 --> 04:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
are so unsafe that they require us to
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
treat them differently by law we need to
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
be sending those back to the
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to get a safer product not
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
punishing people who are trying to move
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
to a different product um there was talk
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
of an amendment to restricted under
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
dwellings uh I think that could have
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
been something that could have been
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
talked about but I just even then those
 
04:27:13.389 --> 04:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
are privately owned um oftentimes and I
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
think this is an overreach of government
 
04:27:17.710 --> 04:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
into people's private
 
04:27:19.710 --> 04:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
property anybody else from the committee
 
04:27:21.790 --> 04:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
sir anybody
 
04:27:27.389 --> 04:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
else okay uh personally I would have
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
preferred to see n retain would have
 
04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
worked we we do have a commission
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
working on um some of the adverse
 
04:27:39.389 --> 04:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
effects of of um electric I mean um ion
 
04:27:39.399 --> 04:27:40.630 align:start position:0%
effects of of um electric I mean um ion
batteries

04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
batteries
 
04:27:44.070 --> 04:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
but I I do Point well taken um I guess
 
04:27:45.870 --> 04:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that no with nobody
 
04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
else from the committee here I am
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
stuttering I'll ask the clerk to call

when she's ready uh the motion on the
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%

Lane
 
04:30:27.070 --> 04:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
filtering uh I'll open it up to the
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
floor for a motion I have nobody signed
 
04:30:31.349 --> 04:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
it why not
 
04:30:37.469 --> 04:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
itl representative CER moves inexpedient
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
the legislator is there second second
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Crawford here
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
to speak your motion sir um I think
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's some issues that were brought up
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
by this bill but the bill as written
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
just is is a little too rough and uh
 
04:30:53.429 --> 04:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
really can't be salvaged
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
and basically just creates more
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
questions and safety issues than uh what
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be for what we think there
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
might be a use for something like this
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
committee so I was really hoping that
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
this could uh could be something that
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
would be retained because the two
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
biggest arguments that I heard um were a
 
04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
lack of education and by retaining it we
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
could address the education portion and
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
then some writing changes in terms of
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know breakdown Lane
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
use in certain applications or you know
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh CLE cleaning up some of the writing I
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
really don't think this is a baby out
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
with the bathwater issue um the other
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
complaint that I heard was that other
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
states aren't doing it but I know that
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
Connecticut is hearing similar
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
legislation as we speak um and I believe
 
04:31:43.349 --> 04:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
there's similar legislation proposed in
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine so where in New
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is trying to lead the way I
 
04:31:49.149 --> 04:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
think that we'd be better off to retain
 
04:31:50.710 --> 04:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
this and actually start focusing on the
 
04:31:52.389 --> 04:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
education Dynamic of bringing it here
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
because it's going to come here one way
 
04:31:55.389 --> 04:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
or another sooner or
 
04:31:57.550 --> 04:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
later anybody else from the committee
 
04:31:58.750 --> 04:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
represent St
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you I I
 
04:32:05.229 --> 04:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
um I hope that we uh do take this up
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
again with a different Bill uh in the
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
next next year it'll just be different a
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
different enough so that's all thank
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
else um I'll chime in just for a moment
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
um I've been riding on the street for a
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
long time I understand we have an issue
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
with distraction and with possibly
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
autonomous vehicles someday possibly
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
causing a lot more rear and crashes so I
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
get it uh but the way this bill was
 
04:32:35.349 --> 04:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
written and some of the other unintended
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of The Way It Was Written I
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
just couldn't
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
support I don't I did not talk to you uh
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
in our break but I in terms of whether
 
04:32:45.109 --> 04:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
we should retain this or an expedient to
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
legislate uh I also did talk with the
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
speaker who does determine gerain this
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh and this bill was silent on breakdown
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
Lane use so he's told me that that would
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
be something non- gerain enough to have
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
a separate bill in our second year
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
without any issue so you're right this
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
is not the baby out with the bath water
 
04:33:09.070 --> 04:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
even with the itl uh this will be coming
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
back um I guess I'll leave at that I
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
think you know talking about breakdown
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
use does have some Merit because I think
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
that is a real possibility of being
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
solved so with nobody else to speak to
 
04:33:27.310 --> 04:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
the bill I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%

04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlin care to speak to
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment sir yes thank you um when
 
04:38:02.269 --> 04:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
this bill was uh introduced to us by
 
04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson uh I thought it
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
was a good idea to command Mar Bunker
 
04:38:08.910 --> 04:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
Hill but since we're already in 2025 and
 
04:38:10.990 --> 04:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
the Battle of Bunker Hill took place in
 
04:38:14.551 --> 04:38:14.561 align:start position:0%
2025 it kind of uh made it a little less
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
relevant for us because we wouldn't have
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
as much time to to enjoy the the plates
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
and to get the process going and get the
 
04:38:23.551 --> 04:38:23.561 align:start position:0%
place designed and distributed so um I
 
04:38:25.709 --> 04:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
suggested making it the 250th
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
anniversary of the American of American
 
04:38:31.150 --> 04:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
independence which is you know um the
 
04:38:32.670 --> 04:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence and New
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the first state to uh to
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
declare independence from the crown so
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's very extremely relevant and it's
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
got a much broader appeal um so I put
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
through this this amendment which um
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
takes care of a couple things that the
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
DMV asked for which is setting a a fee
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
and a distribution process for the
 
04:38:53.150 --> 04:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
plates and the rest will go through uh
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
processes thank you sir anybody else
 
04:39:01.629 --> 04:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
04:39:05.709 --> 04:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have I guess one question
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
um it appears that we're only
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
getting the front license place
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
but I see the um wording that says the
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
price for the plates shall be 25 and and
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what if in fact we're only
 
04:39:22.719 --> 04:39:24.109 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what if in fact we're only
getting

04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:39:24.119 --> 04:39:25.949 align:start position:0%
getting
one

04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:25.959 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:39:29.349 --> 04:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
um and and why would we only get one why
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
would we not make it a cover plate I
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
guess for
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
both that's
 
04:39:34.480 --> 04:39:36.510 align:start position:0%
both that's
all

04:39:36.510 --> 04:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:39:39.628 --> 04:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
answer the second one which is the
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
commemorative plate statute only deals
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the front plate right um it's even
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
though our cover plates are in the same
 
04:39:51.070 --> 04:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
chapter of lots a different paragraph
 
04:39:51.080 --> 04:39:52.070 align:start position:0%
chapter of lots a different paragraph
we're

04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
allowed both front and rear that's why
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
we have to have a you know at least
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
noticed on our registrations or nowadays
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
they use a document separate document
 
04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
these don't need that uh and it's also
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
if you'll notice uh repealed um on July
 
04:40:09.788 --> 04:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
4th 2027 they're only good for the
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
year let's read this again though and
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the display of said plates and rep place
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
of the front license plate on
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles yeah I don't I
 
04:40:24.868 --> 04:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
don't plates and the display of said
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
plates I think it's talking about the
 
04:40:29.550 --> 04:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
plates in general not just the ones you
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
get how I read
 
04:40:34.510 --> 04:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
it that
 
04:40:34.520 --> 04:40:38.430 align:start position:0%
it that
well

04:40:38.430 --> 04:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
plates yeah5
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
it I it it also says they rather than it
 
04:40:47.470 --> 04:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
for shall be distributed I think this is
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
the plates cost $25 each and they
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
broadly will be distributed by the DMV
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
to people who buy them yeah I think it's
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
just referring to the plates I get I I'm
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
a stickler on like that too but this one
 
04:41:01.150 --> 04:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't strike me as yeah I understand
 
04:41:03.788 --> 04:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
the question but I don't know if it's a
 
04:41:03.798 --> 04:41:04.910 align:start position:0%
the question but I don't know if it's a
large

04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
large
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
enough misunderstanding that needs to be
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
changed or if it can be done and
 
04:41:13.990 --> 04:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
enrolled I was Bill amendments this
 
04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
would would
 
04:41:19.868 --> 04:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
be my opinion Mr chairman is that this
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be um if there is an issue and I
 
04:41:25.550 --> 04:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't believe that there is but if there
 
04:41:28.350 --> 04:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
were an issue it it's such a such a
 
04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
minor point that it would be could be
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
corrected in enrolled uh Bill process
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
and we could bring that to the attention
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the the clerk if
 
04:41:39.990 --> 04:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
necessary I am on the enrolled bills
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
committee so I probably could uh I just
 
04:41:46.350 --> 04:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
it just struck me here that it could be
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
read either way and I didn't know if it
 
04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
was something
 
04:41:53.190 --> 04:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
that was a simple fix or not or
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
necessary that's all I think we're
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
covered in the one line on 13 where it
 
04:42:01.390 --> 04:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
said the display of said plates in place
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the front license plates on vehicles
 
04:42:07.590 --> 04:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
should cover us that's just my
 
04:42:10.350 --> 04:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
opinion anybody else on the amendment
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
question of the chair what what's the
 
04:42:16.150 --> 04:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
enrolled Bill committee rolled Bill
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hills on it
 
04:42:22.270 --> 04:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'll let him explain in detail um it's
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
after everything has passed um and
 
04:42:27.628 --> 04:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
before but before it gets signed off on
 
04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
by the um Senate President the speaker
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
the um Secretary of State and the
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
governor um they go through just to make
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
sure there's no conflicts here and there
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
or crossing keys starting eyes all of
 
04:42:44.830 --> 04:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
that stuff and and you're just
 
04:42:47.948 --> 04:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
correcting things like this um that's
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
all just a procedural thing thank you
 
04:42:54.150 --> 04:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
some again as simple as cleaning up the
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
grammar sometimes but again and I think
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
this Falls there because of the fact
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
that it deals with front license plates
 
04:43:04.110 --> 04:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
only by by by description so anybody
 
04:43:06.030 --> 04:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
else on the amendment I think we're good
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
to go with it seeing none um all those
 
04:43:14.350 --> 04:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of adop in Amendment 0139 H say
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
I I I oppose nay so the amendment is
 
04:43:21.868 --> 04:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
adopted the motion on the floor is ought
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
to pass as adopted care to speak any
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
more de your motion no I think the the
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is Bill now so seeing none
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
nobody else representative St
 
04:43:38.110 --> 04:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
chair I I uh I get the feeling is going
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
to pass but I am a little confused maybe
 
04:43:48.670 --> 04:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh because of the arguments that people
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
had on a bill to allow only one license
 
04:43:56.350 --> 04:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
plate on antique vehicles or specialty
 
04:43:59.910 --> 04:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
Vehicles because of the uh fear of uh I
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
guess some lost Revenue with the
 
04:44:06.030 --> 04:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
tolls uh police just freaking out
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
because a vehicle went by and they could
 
04:44:10.350 --> 04:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
only grab the front plate not the rear
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
plate etc etc and yet here we are
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
putting a license plate allowing only
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
one license plate on vehicles in the
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for a whole year
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
so I uh I hope everybody remembers this
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
because I have a feeling there could be
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
a bill again next year uh again asking
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
us to allow only a real license plate on
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
specialty cars or cars that don't come
 
04:44:39.550 --> 04:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
with a indentation for a license plate
 
04:44:41.948 --> 04:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
um you know had a lot of discussion on
 
04:44:44.830 --> 04:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
that so that's all thank you very much
 
04:44:47.070 --> 04:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
very astute representative s clear
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
actually this was part of the argument
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
last time we had that bill and it was
 
04:44:51.628 --> 04:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
part of the justification and I don't
 
04:44:53.230 --> 04:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
disagree with
 
04:44:55.990 --> 04:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
you um actually to be honest I was
 
04:44:57.390 --> 04:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
surprised we didn't see one of those
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
bills this year um but that being said
 
04:45:00.878 --> 04:45:02.030 align:start position:0%
bills this year um but that being said
anybody

04:45:02.030 --> 04:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
else I saw
 
04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair just for
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
clarification this is not precedent
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
setting because I know in Nashville had
 
04:45:14.070 --> 04:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
at sues Centennial we sold plates for
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
the front so it's not precedent setting
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
it is for a year and hopefully it will
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
generate some much needed revenue for
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
DOT so thank you represent
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
SES i' um I'd like to actually thank
 
04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair for reminding me
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
of uh previous positions that I have
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
taken and um I I was inclined to think
 
04:45:41.708 --> 04:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
that this was somewhat benign but based
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
on his reminder which is quite valid I I
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:54.990 --> 04:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
bill Mr Cherry it's nice to see people
 
04:45:55.000 --> 04:45:57.270 align:start position:0%
bill Mr Cherry it's nice to see people
being

04:45:57.270 --> 04:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
consistent representative G so uh my
 
04:46:04.510 --> 04:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
honorable colleague over here points out
 
04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
that this could be the gateway to people
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
actually having freedom of expression
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
with the front of their vehicles
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
individual ual freedom of expression
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
with the front of their vehicles I
 
04:46:17.310 --> 04:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
support it we're getting up the context
 
04:46:18.990 --> 04:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill has
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
amended representative Fox did you have
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
your hands up I did I just wanted to
 
04:46:27.150 --> 04:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
thank representative St Clair as well
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
and ditto what representative Sykes
 
04:46:35.070 --> 04:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
said I'm I'm sorry um I I missed the
 
04:46:37.470 --> 04:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
point that my colleague represented St
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
Clair said Can someone walk me through
 
04:46:41.470 --> 04:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
that again with the front plate what
 
04:46:41.480 --> 04:46:45.470 align:start position:0%
that again with the front plate what
I'll

04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
okay so in the actually you weren't here
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
welcome back for the last couple of
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
terms or at least two year uh I forget
 
04:46:55.390 --> 04:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
how many years at least twice we've seen
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
attempts to eliminate the front license
 
04:47:01.868 --> 04:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
plate on personal Motor Vehicles which
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
and they failed both
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
times and the argument was that we
 
04:47:07.470 --> 04:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't do without the front license
 
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
plate because we lose whole revenues
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
it's not good for the department of
 
04:47:14.430 --> 04:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
safety using their plate readers etc etc
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
etc so he was just pointing out the
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
irony that we said we need that front
 
04:47:23.628 --> 04:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
plate so importantly in the past why
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
should we give up the front plate when
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
we have a commemorative plate for the
 
04:47:30.548 --> 04:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
250th anniversary of the United
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
States just drawing
 
04:47:35.868 --> 04:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
a I want to thank him for for instilling
 
04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
this debate on what I thought was a very
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
simple I'm I'm I'm sorry so the Comm
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
ative plate isn't going to have the
 
04:47:46.030 --> 04:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
regist the license plate number on it no
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
it won't no and these the this chapter
 
04:47:52.430 --> 04:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
he's been in statute for a long time you
 
04:47:55.110 --> 04:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
see a lot of towns using this on their
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
on their anniversaries or bicentennials
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
they're only good for a year they have
 
04:48:02.548 --> 04:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
are cover plate you still have to have
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
your vehicle registered so it's not like
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
the Moose sticker it's a no no it is a
 
04:48:13.150 --> 04:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you purchased purchased
 
04:48:18.750 --> 04:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
individually and okay hold on
 
04:48:18.760 --> 04:48:19.868 align:start position:0%
individually and okay hold on
representative

04:48:19.868 --> 04:48:19.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
crawfords so just remember this plate is
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
for a year
 
04:48:27.628 --> 04:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
plus I'd love to say it's going to you
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
know get a lot of Revenue but how many
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
are we going to sell there aren't going
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
to be loads of thousands of people with
 
04:48:37.948 --> 04:48:37.958 align:start position:0%
this in New Hampshire with this plate oh
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
we do I'm buy I don't think so
 
04:48:43.708 --> 04:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
yeah anybody else from the committee I
 
04:48:44.788 --> 04:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
just quickly point out that this does
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
come with some Revenue it doesn't cost
 
04:48:47.788 --> 04:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
$25 to generate these plates so there
 
04:48:49.390 --> 04:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
will be some Revenue coming back to the
 
04:48:52.230 --> 04:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
the state and going to the cause listed
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.868 --> 04:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
so anybody else from the committee who's
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
in the office oh we lost a couple of
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
people here oh no we didn't I
 
04:49:06.030 --> 04:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
did no we don't have H actually that's a
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
crate back there we may we may have
 
04:49:10.590 --> 04:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
one anybody else did I see a hand over
 
04:49:12.510 --> 04:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
here here no all right we're almost done
 
04:49:13.868 --> 04:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
we're almost done beating this one to
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
death representative Hamlin uh thank you
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so we're talking about the front
 
04:49:25.230 --> 04:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
plate fine but nothing is mentioned to
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
exclude motorcycles from this
 
04:49:31.868 --> 04:49:31.878 align:start position:0%
bill whereas they only use a rear plate
 
04:49:36.270 --> 04:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
so they are not allowed to express their
 
04:49:38.548 --> 04:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
independence these are passenger vehicle
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
plates they're a different size this
 
04:49:43.390 --> 04:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to motor V motorcycles
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay a they don't have two plates and B
 
04:49:49.590 --> 04:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
they're much smaller not relative so we
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
won't be able to get a cover plate on
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
the rear of our motorcycle either okay
 
04:49:53.638 --> 04:49:54.350 align:start position:0%
the rear of our motorcycle either okay

04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um you know when we were
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony in this whole this
 
04:53:41.240 --> 04:53:42.070 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony in this whole this
whole

04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know if it's the Executive
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
coaching me but listening to this was
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
like they want us to legislate
 
04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
communication between departments and I
 
04:53:57.868 --> 04:53:57.878 align:start position:0%
just this is something that I think you
 
04:54:00.510 --> 04:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of work it out and figure it
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
out I'm really not a big fan of creating
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
a bill in a law that says You must talk
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
to each other so based on that I just
 
04:54:11.788 --> 04:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
can't support this and that's why I say
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
itl on this
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else from the committee
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
chairman first off I need to apologize
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee the fellow that I
 
04:54:25.948 --> 04:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
talked with um also apologized to me and
 
04:54:29.788 --> 04:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
said it's not Hippa it was Foya that and
 
04:54:32.430 --> 04:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
he said I always get that mixed up but
 
04:54:36.150 --> 04:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
it also um is part of the and I'll ask
 
04:54:38.990 --> 04:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
the chair for the reminder of the state
 
04:54:43.150 --> 04:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
law it is is what the Privacy yeah I'm
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
you had to ask me the actual Acron have
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
Acron it's driver privacy driver Privacy
 
04:54:53.670 --> 04:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
Act would be good enough for
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
conversation driver Privacy Act um which
 
04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
is what my chief of police in Northfield
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
um which was the impetus for the entire
 
04:55:09.070 --> 04:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
Bill and and he said under that um it
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't list the fire department is who
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
he can share information
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
with he turned around and asked the
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
Chief of Police Association which he
 
04:55:22.270 --> 04:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
belongs to for their opinion and they
 
04:55:25.868 --> 04:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
came back to him and said we don't care
 
04:55:30.190 --> 04:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
so um he's he has asked me to support it
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
he thinks it's important but he said the
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police do not so or don't care
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
so um for that reason I'm going to um
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
vote on to but uh but that's my summary
 
04:55:46.628 --> 04:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
of past
 
04:55:49.110 --> 04:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
events anybody else from the committee
 
04:55:49.120 --> 04:55:50.190 align:start position:0%
events anybody else from the committee
representative

04:55:50.190 --> 04:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:55:54.030 --> 04:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
SES yeah so um I I'm also will vote
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion only because I
 
04:56:00.750 --> 04:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
felt that there was a no harm no foul
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
aspect to this bill and that
 
04:56:06.788 --> 04:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
um sometimes a little guidance to help
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
people move to do the right thing is not
 
04:56:12.868 --> 04:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
and there's no I I don't see any any
 
04:56:15.150 --> 04:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
reason why we shouldn't be able to uh
 
04:56:17.708 --> 04:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
help the small volunteer fire
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
departments who may not have the total
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
resources necessary to gain this
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
information when they they should be
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
so against them against the itl yeah and
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
and if if we get to that point then I
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
OTP anybody else in the
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
commit um I saw him first I'm sorry
 
04:56:45.070 --> 04:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
represent Miller yeah sorry just quick
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
clarification what was the citation that
 
04:56:49.628 --> 04:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
you were saying affected the sharing
 
04:56:52.230 --> 04:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
from the police to the fire
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
department it's the one we can't think
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
of um you thought it was 264 something
 
04:56:57.120 --> 04:56:58.470 align:start position:0%
of um you thought it was 264 something
it's

04:56:58.470 --> 04:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
26144 thank
 
04:57:02.990 --> 04:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
you and it's motor vehicle records and
 
04:57:06.270 --> 04:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
certification uh 2614 and it's all about
 
04:57:08.590 --> 04:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
privacy of the information particularly
 
04:57:11.150 --> 04:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's possessed by agency
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh and again this is a direct change to
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
I say
 
04:57:18.868 --> 04:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
26014 actually Roman
 
04:57:22.030 --> 04:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
7 um that's added and I still have to
 
04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
question why it wasn't there to begin
 
04:57:25.868 --> 04:57:25.878 align:start position:0%
with from what I understand right now
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent the fire
 
04:57:28.350 --> 04:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
department from going over to the
 
04:57:30.270 --> 04:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
individual to get the information
 
04:57:32.830 --> 04:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
because it's not a violation of this law
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
when the owner gives them the
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
information it's just what this
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
currently it's always been understood
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
and protected that once an agency has
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
personal and private information that
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
they keep it if they're allowed to have
 
04:57:50.670 --> 04:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
it so um that's where we are on that
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the committee any
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Fox thank you Mr chairman
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
I asked that question myself and and
 
04:58:03.390 --> 04:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
uh the answer that I received is the
 
04:58:05.788 --> 04:58:05.798 align:start position:0%
fire department doesn't generally have
 
04:58:08.590 --> 04:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
the information to go to the person
 
04:58:11.868 --> 04:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
directly so after the fact after an
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
event where the fire department has
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
shown up spread their kitty litter or
 
04:58:21.548 --> 04:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
whatever they've done um they don't stop
 
04:58:26.110 --> 04:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
and ask the people involved for their
 
04:58:27.868 --> 04:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
name and address and information the
 
04:58:29.868 --> 04:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
police department does
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
that so there in lies the issue with
 
04:58:36.030 --> 04:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
them going directly because they can go
 
04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
directly if they have the information
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
the name the phone number and and um
 
04:58:40.400 --> 04:58:41.990 align:start position:0%
the name the phone number and and um
insurance

04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
information may I ask another just an
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
another question I have is
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
um representative PR was asked about the
 
04:58:55.230 --> 04:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
services from the fire department that
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
are billable does anybody did anybody
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
get a list of those Services other than
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
the kitty litter that we know about I
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
did not receive
 
04:59:07.110 --> 04:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
anything it's just m but but but there
 
04:59:09.150 --> 04:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
in lies the question and that's the one
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
we have to ask answer ourselves today is
 
04:59:15.750 --> 04:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
the Speedy dry justifiably another
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
reason for the sharing of per people's
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
personal information outside of what's
 
04:59:22.628 --> 04:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
currently written in law this in other
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
words makes one more exception to it
 
04:59:27.910 --> 04:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
being spread and by who so that's that's
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
really the question we're
 
04:59:32.990 --> 04:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
asking and representative Hill so I
 
04:59:35.708 --> 04:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
thought representative PR did mention
 
04:59:38.190 --> 04:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
that they're probably not going to get
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
this information for the speedy dry um
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
but if they had to um um arrange the
 
04:59:45.680 --> 04:59:47.788 align:start position:0%
but if they had to um um arrange the
environmental

04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
straw tubes whatever those are called um
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
which are fairly expensive that that's
 
04:59:55.230 --> 04:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
what they were looking for is that kind
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
of information I think that was what was
 
04:59:59.868 --> 04:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
used in this particular accident as a
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
fact you on that if I remember correctly
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
there it did come up in our conversation
 
05:00:07.868 --> 05:00:07.878 align:start position:0%
that there could be certain
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances when the accident is under
 
05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
investigation and it certainly wouldn't
 
05:00:14.670 --> 05:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
be wise for police to be sharing any of
 
05:00:16.910 --> 05:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
the information um you know a lot of
 
05:00:18.510 --> 05:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
things we don't know what goes on in
 
05:00:19.708 --> 05:00:19.718 align:start position:0%
that course
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
so again there had to have been a reason
 
05:00:24.110 --> 05:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
why it wasn't in inserted the first time
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
so just I'll leave it at that anybody
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
else from the
 
05:00:31.470 --> 05:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
committee see amen I'll ask the clerk to
 
05:00:32.670 --> 05:00:32.680 align:start position:0%

CLA I saw him first can to speak to your
 
05:03:52.030 --> 05:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
motion sir yes thank you uh this bill
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
helps a lot of young people who are
 
05:03:55.628 --> 05:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
transitioning to a standard operator
 
05:03:57.548 --> 05:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
license which is the horizontally
 
05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
oriented license um it helps them avoid
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
the hassle of getting the vertical the
 
05:04:05.350 --> 05:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
vertical youth operator license if they
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
try if they have to uh renew ahead of
 
05:04:09.430 --> 05:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
time or having to wait until their
 
05:04:11.948 --> 05:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
birthday to get the horizontal licensees
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
it also helps uh alleviate some of the
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
administrative burden on the DMV by
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
spreading out the demand for new
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
licenses and removing the need to issue
 
05:04:22.628 --> 05:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
duplicate licenses when the young people
 
05:04:24.910 --> 05:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
inevitably come back with their vertical
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
licenses to get the horizontal duplicate
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:35.868 --> 05:04:35.878 align:start position:0%

05:09:07.868 --> 05:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
SES so um we've heard this bill before
 
05:09:11.350 --> 05:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
and um it its fate is probably going to
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
be no different this year than it was in
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
previous years that said I still feel
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
very compelled to speak in favor of the
 
05:09:22.548 --> 05:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
bill I do so because uh of several
 
05:09:26.830 --> 05:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
reasons reason number one um in Prior
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
years it's been a student Le Health
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
Initiative on why the bill was presented
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
to us in the first place and and you
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
know not for nothing we would always
 
05:09:42.270 --> 05:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
like to encourage young people to be
 
05:09:43.868 --> 05:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
feeling that they can make a difference
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
in their government and that that is
 
05:09:48.750 --> 05:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
really important uh lesson for them to
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
see and learn um
 
05:09:56.110 --> 05:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
second the statistics about secondhand
 
05:09:59.708 --> 05:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
smoke and the the delorious effect it
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
has on a person's health
 
05:10:02.878 --> 05:10:04.470 align:start position:0%
has on a person's health
are

05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:10:10.548 --> 05:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
um well proven in my mind and um
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
that because children and this covers
 
05:10:21.070 --> 05:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
children because children often have to
 
05:10:23.230 --> 05:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
ride in the
 
05:10:25.830 --> 05:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
car with a person who smokes and they
 
05:10:28.868 --> 05:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
have no control over that who looks out
 
05:10:32.990 --> 05:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
for their interest who protects them um
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
we do require seat belts for for uh
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
persons under the age of 18 because
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's a really important thing to do
 
05:10:45.310 --> 05:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
and and that is uh has strong bipartisan
 
05:10:47.548 --> 05:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
support throughout throughout the state
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
for many for decades now um this is an
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
example where we have an obligation to
 
05:10:57.070 --> 05:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
protect children who may have to ride in
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
a car where they don't have any control
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
and it is really bad for the health um
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
we did hear in Prior years excellent
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
testimony about how
 
05:11:12.868 --> 05:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
opening the windows in your car actually
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the front windows while a person is
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
smoking actually makes it worse for the
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
smoke to get into the back of the car
 
05:11:20.600 --> 05:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
smoke to get into the back of the car
and

05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:26.190 --> 05:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
um I just for for a variety of reasons I
 
05:11:29.310 --> 05:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
think that we as a
 
05:11:32.590 --> 05:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
um we as a society have to yes we have
 
05:11:36.350 --> 05:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
to weigh privacy results and uh uh
 
05:11:40.708 --> 05:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
concerns yes we have to weigh uh uh uh
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
government governmental reach but
 
05:11:44.080 --> 05:11:45.670 align:start position:0%
government governmental reach but
generally

05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
generally
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
speaking we are in support of protecting
 
05:11:51.990 --> 05:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
those members of society who do not have
 
05:11:54.430 --> 05:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
a voice and who are not protected by
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
anyone other than us passing legislation
 
05:12:02.110 --> 05:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to protect them and I
 
05:12:05.310 --> 05:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
as I and I would urge my colleagues to
 
05:12:08.190 --> 05:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
think long and carefully and hard about
 
05:12:08.200 --> 05:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
think long and carefully and hard about
how

05:12:11.030 --> 05:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:12:15.788 --> 05:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
we do we do have that obligation to
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
protect children and that's what this
 
05:12:19.750 --> 05:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill is about this bill is about
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
protecting children who are riding in
 
05:12:24.830 --> 05:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles where uh folks who probably
 
05:12:26.910 --> 05:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't smoke in the car while they're
 
05:12:29.230 --> 05:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
there but still do
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
set anybody else from the
 
05:12:39.390 --> 05:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative St Clair
 
05:12:42.830 --> 05:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I uh I'm disappointed
 
05:12:45.628 --> 05:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
that the uh the sponsor wasn't here for
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
this and I I'm glad that uh
 
05:12:50.310 --> 05:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes brought up the uh
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
fact that there were students here uh
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
the last time this was discussed I think
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
they made a a really good a a good
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
presentation it's too bad that we can't
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
pass laws to uh have good parenting and
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
against bad parenting you know it just
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work and I get that the fact
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
that this is a secondary though a
 
05:13:16.868 --> 05:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
secondary uh enforced law uh I think
 
05:13:20.670 --> 05:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
uh makes me want to vote for it
 
05:13:22.868 --> 05:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
because I guess if you're thick enough
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
to to not get rid of it before you get
 
05:13:29.070 --> 05:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
stopped or something uh so be it I don't
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad a bad message to send I
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to pass on the
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
floor but nonetheless uh I think it's
 
05:13:38.510 --> 05:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of uh being pushed in that
 
05:13:38.520 --> 05:13:39.788 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of uh being pushed in that
direction

05:13:39.788 --> 05:13:39.798 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gorski thank
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
05:13:47.548 --> 05:13:47.558 align:start position:0%
um this bill came up last term and I
 
05:13:51.708 --> 05:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
actually was uh speaking against the
 
05:13:54.548 --> 05:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
bill and here's what strikes me the
 
05:13:56.190 --> 05:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of this
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
bill is not to
 
05:14:02.590 --> 05:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
smoke with kids who are under 16 in the
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
car but according to how it's
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
written as long as I obey the rules of
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
the road
 
05:14:12.270 --> 05:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
I could smoke to my heart's content and
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
the police won't pull me over because
 
05:14:16.270 --> 05:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
they can't pull me over if I'm smoking
 
05:14:18.628 --> 05:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
with someone who's less than 16 years 16
 
05:14:21.150 --> 05:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
years old in the car it defeats the
 
05:14:24.110 --> 05:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill because if I follow
 
05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
the rules of the road I can still do it
 
05:14:32.070 --> 05:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
so this bill I thought was just not
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time and that's why you
 
05:14:37.548 --> 05:14:37.558 align:start position:0%
know I I really can't support
 
05:14:41.030 --> 05:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
it anybody else from the
 
05:14:43.150 --> 05:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
committee representative St Clair wants
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
another stab yeah I'll make it quick I
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh I I see the reason for the secondary
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement because uh we can't
 
05:14:53.230 --> 05:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
expect law enforcement to to see
 
05:14:55.230 --> 05:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
somebody going by at whatever speed and
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
oh I think they had a cigarette going or
 
05:14:58.868 --> 05:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
I think they had a vape going that makes
 
05:15:01.868 --> 05:15:01.878 align:start position:0%
it hard however again if you stop
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
somebody and you walk up to the vehicle
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then there's smoke coming out
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're vaping in front of you or
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
smoking and they get kids under under
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
the age in the back then you know I
 
05:15:14.190 --> 05:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
guess they've left left themselves open
 
05:15:16.390 --> 05:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
to an education whatever that education
 
05:15:19.390 --> 05:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
may be a warning uh a ticket or whatever
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
but I understand why it wouldn't work as
 
05:15:24.030 --> 05:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
a primary thing because it would be near
 
05:15:26.310 --> 05:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
impossible and I would hate to think
 
05:15:29.310 --> 05:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
giving uh law enforcement a reason for
 
05:15:31.830 --> 05:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh probable causeing I think I saw a
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
smoke coming out of here I think you
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
were doing something that's why I
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
stopped you and oh by the way now that I
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
got you but enough thank you
 
05:15:42.990 --> 05:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
right so representative Johnson next
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is the kind of bill
 
05:15:46.350 --> 05:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
that I wish had been on the books when I
 
05:15:48.190 --> 05:15:48.200 align:start position:0%
was a kid uh I've been on the wrong end
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
of it too many times and that's why I'll
 
05:15:51.750 --> 05:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
be supporting this
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
bill representative Hill thank you Mr
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
chairman um even worse than trying to
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
have a police officer determine whether
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
someone was smoking in there it's going
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
to be even harder to say I think they're
 
05:16:09.390 --> 05:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
16 um or 14 or 15 so I don't don't know
 
05:16:12.990 --> 05:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
how you could ever do it um and unless
 
05:16:18.430 --> 05:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
it's a second second um infraction but
 
05:16:21.750 --> 05:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
um I agree for that reason then with uh
 
05:16:26.230 --> 05:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
Vice chair kski that um if if
 
05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
someone if someone maintains their uh
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
control of their car in a reasonable
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
fashion they'll never get pulled over
 
05:16:37.150 --> 05:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
and this will continue to exist so what
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative Miller thank you uh to to
 
05:16:46.948 --> 05:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
sort of directly address uh
 
05:16:48.670 --> 05:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative hilling Gorski there what
 
05:16:50.548 --> 05:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
the hell is the point the point is we
 
05:16:52.628 --> 05:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
make incremental improvements we help
 
05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
protect the people we can when we can
 
05:16:56.110 --> 05:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
and where we can it's not going to be a
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
Panacea none of these are but we help
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
the people we can especially those who
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
can't help themselves when and where we
 
05:17:04.590 --> 05:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
can thank
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
you anybody else representative guys I
 
05:17:10.270 --> 05:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
guess my big privacy concern comes back
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
to something representative Sinclair
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
said earlier also and that's that we
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
can't legislate good parenting you know
 
05:17:17.590 --> 05:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
people should not be smoking around
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
their kids but we can't go into
 
05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
somebody's private residence to
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
determine if that's happening that would
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
be a violation of multiple articles of
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
state and federal
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution now we're applying
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
different laws to your property and
 
05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
what's within your reach on your vehicle
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
which is mobile um you know yes there's
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
a precedent for it that there's
 
05:17:36.868 --> 05:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
different restraint laws for kids and
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
those are you know based on uh growth
 
05:17:41.470 --> 05:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
and development and there's a growth and
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
development Dynamic over here do I think
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
that kids should be smoked around in
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
general no I don't do I think that
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
parents should not smoke in front of
 
05:17:50.390 --> 05:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
their kids in a car I agree with that
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that it's within our
 
05:17:53.548 --> 05:17:53.558 align:start position:0%
purview to reach into people's homes or
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
into people's cars to restrict adult
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
conduct drop the mic anybody else from
 
05:18:00.480 --> 05:18:01.190 align:start position:0%
conduct drop the mic anybody else from
the

05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
committee seeing nothing I'll ask the
 
05:18:04.708 --> 05:18:04.718 align:start position:0%

05:18:06.430 --> 05:18:06.440 align:start position:0%

05:18:14.670 --> 05:18:14.680 align:start position:0%

floor with House Bill apparently we have
 
05:19:56.788 --> 05:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
determined that we're not going to just
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
let it go to a voice Voice vote yeah
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
okay unless somebody speaks against it
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
for some reason but I don't proceive
 
05:20:05.310 --> 05:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
that so I will keep whose name's on
 
05:20:06.990 --> 05:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
there to speak for the committee in case
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
somebody speaks to it the way it was
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
yeah or
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
you how did you in other words what I do
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
with the clerk usually just for
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's knowledge especially the
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
Freshman so before before every house
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
session I have to put together a debate
 
05:20:21.868 --> 05:20:21.878 align:start position:0%
sheet on all the people who are going to
 
05:20:23.830 --> 05:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
defend our committee
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
reports um that would be both either
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
doing the speech and then the
 
05:20:29.910 --> 05:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary inquiry sometimes it's the
 
05:20:32.430 --> 05:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
same person sometimes I split it up so
 
05:20:34.948 --> 05:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
in this particular case we don't I don't
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
expect anybody to speak against it so
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
the clerk if doesn't see any opposition
 
05:20:43.590 --> 05:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
to it won't call the person speaking for
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
it unless I ask him to um I just want to
 
05:20:48.788 --> 05:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm putting the right person
 
05:20:50.670 --> 05:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
down that wants to cover this if
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
something happens otherwise I will cover
 
05:20:57.548 --> 05:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:59.590 --> 05:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
cover fair enough that's what I want to
 
05:21:03.788 --> 05:21:03.798 align:start position:0%
do that um thank you and and again too
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is it's a great bill it's a great
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's a great cause but when we get to
 
05:21:10.430 --> 05:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
the house or it should be efficiency
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
purposes if we don't have a fight on
 
05:21:13.590 --> 05:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
this we shouldn't be taking up time on
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
um representative pataro you're okay
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
defending that
 
05:21:30.150 --> 05:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
bill um for Thursday my uh handicap
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
license we bill yeah yeah I'll I'll be
 
05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
good I'll have some material ready to go
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
just in case and the only change I saw
 
05:21:39.750 --> 05:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
the regular
 
05:21:42.470 --> 05:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
calendar we I'll take credit for the
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
mistake too except they didn't get
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
caught in the uh at the speaker's office
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
either we were okay with the consent on
 
05:21:53.868 --> 05:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
the conservation license plate for uh C
 
05:21:56.670 --> 05:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
CYO bacteria but it did have a greater
 
05:21:58.868 --> 05:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal note than I thought it did so
 
05:22:00.270 --> 05:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
that is going to go to the regular
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
calendar it has to um my mistake uh
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
again we've done this in the past we
 
05:22:08.670 --> 05:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
were fine with it but it can't go to to
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
the consent so that will be coming off
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
who would like to defend the committee
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
