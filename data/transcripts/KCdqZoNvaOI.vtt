be here today so I'll be running the
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
show I guess and uh if you would uh
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%

welcome to uh division two
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Vice chair uh Petrie and
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
committee members I'd like to thank you
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to present the
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
budget for New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
department this morning
 
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure some of you looked at our
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
budget I would like to say the probably
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
the brightest point in our budget uh is
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
our increased budget transfer payment to
 
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:27.500 align:start position:0%
the trails Bureau
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that we have budgeted uh
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
an increase of two million dollars per
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
year uh to transfer money to the trails
 
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
year uh to transfer money to the trails
Bureau

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
our budget request is also up due to the
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
increase in personnel and benefit costs
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
also the costs of doit the transfer
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
costs that we pay to that department has
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
been increasing with each budget cycle
 
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
cost of equipment this year fuel
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
um over the last biennium we've had to
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
increase our spending uh on maintenance
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
or repair items at the Hatchery our
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
hatcheries have suffered many years of
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
not having enough money spent on them on
 
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:14.540 align:start position:0%
maintenance on replacement parts and
 
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:16.700 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of money this year
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
one of the main major issues facing
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
facing fishing game is outdated computer
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
databases and still relying too much on
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
paper manual systems and this path
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I apologize
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't know your name Scott Mason
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and are you referring to
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
a page here or are you reading um just
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
reading a narrative okay can you sort of
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
go back to some of the highlights
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
because I was looking to see where you
 
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
were not realizing that you were okay
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
this budget we've increased
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
um our expenditure on our transfer of
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
funds to the trails Bureau by two
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
um we've saw an increase in oh HIV
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
registrations during covet and we
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
believe that that will remain uh
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
probably even more steady than the
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
increase we saw in license sales
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
our budget request is up
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
due to an increase in uh Personnel costs
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
benefit costs also the doit bill
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
constantly goes up from budget cycle to
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
budget cycle
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
cost of equipment replacement fuel
 
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:38.540 align:start position:0%
electricity are all on the rise
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium we spent a very
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
large amount of money on fixing Wells
 
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:48.980 align:start position:0%
and furnaces at our hatcheries
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of a study
 
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459 align:start position:0%
committee right now looking at our
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
Hatchery system
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
so that we can come into compliance with
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
new EPA permits that one has been issued
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
and one soon will be
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
one of the other major issues facing
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
fish and game is as our outdated
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
computer databases and we still rely too
 
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
much on on the use of paper or manual
 
00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:14.449 align:start position:0%
much on on the use of paper or manual
systems

00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh in the last um biennium one of our
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
um one of our young
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
um computer savvy CEOs was able to come
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
up and launch an online turkey
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
registration program so we've started
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know that started first our new
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries Chief updated our
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hatchery reporting system in the old
 
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
Hatchery reporting system in the old
days

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
um when our folks were out stocking
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
Brooks or ponds they would write a
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
ticket and throw it up on the dashboard
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
of the truck and eventually sometime
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
they'd get some time they'd clean the
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
truck up and get all those tickets and
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
batch them up and send them off and they
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
would be keyed in by another staff
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
member well now we've updated we have
 
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
iPads in the truck when they stock the
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
fish they're stocked at a known
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
GPS Waypoint that is in real time our
 
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
Hatchery staff our biologists and our
 
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
CEOs know what's going on you know where
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
we've where we've stocked what we've
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
stocked how many fish we've stocked
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
there is a time delay still allow the
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
fish to acclimate to where they are we
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't give a waypoint but we do give a
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
general area where we've stocked and
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
that goes on to our web page
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
the first 60 days of this being active
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
we had over three million hits on our
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
web page people looking up to see where
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
um so these are just examples of some of
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
the stuff that we're trying to do to
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
move the department forward and take
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of some of the
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
um efficiencies the computers and and
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
and a more technical approach to
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
managing some of the stuff that we do
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
would afford US
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh and the next biennium we will be
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
bringing forth an online deer
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
registration program updating our
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
licensing software to prevent convicted
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
poachers from being able to buy a
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
license while on suspension online ohrv
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
renewal registrations
 
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
and we are currently working with with
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
doit to upgrade
 
00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
um many of our databases we were we
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
received a gopher Grant and
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
um we're working through that now
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
our dit payment in this budget includes
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
money to pay for a part-time I.T lead
 
00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
most state agencies already have an I.T
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
lead this person will help advise staff
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
and myself better to integrate
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
Technologies into our system they will
 
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
also manage help us manage these upgrade
 
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
projects that we're currently working on
 
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:48.500 align:start position:0%
as some of you may be aware we have
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
transformed our aot review program
 
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.210 align:start position:0%
transformed our aot review program
recently

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
our current program and Staffing levels
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
have been re have reduced the processing
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
time dramatically
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
this has been funded through a gopher
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
Grant and was not included in the budget
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
the Gopher Grant will run out of money
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
December of 24.
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
we need to amend the budget
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
to include 139 thousand dollars to pay
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
for six months of spending for these
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
four staff members and general and and
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
we also need General funding to pay for
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
the program is crucial for our mission
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
to protect threatened and endangered
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
species in New Hampshire
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
as well as providing timing timely
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
review so as not to create an undue
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
burden to development projects in New
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our non-game program is funded
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
with donations it would not be it would
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
be unable to afford this level of
 
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
be unable to afford this level of
Staffing

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
and it's not right to ask the New
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sportsmen to pay through their
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for a service that we
 
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to take a minute the
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
governor has approved funding
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
for our four unfunded conservation
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

right we're asking another 139 000 there
um

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:48.670 align:start position:0%
 
oops

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question could
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
you just
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
as you um we're discussing all your
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
um asks could you just
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
um let us know about the revnos
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
um covid over the years was very good to
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
you actually in a way because people had
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
to be outdoors
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and I know that your revenues were
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
high could you just help me with that
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
please yeah we saw an increase in
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
license sales during the years of covid
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
um those have started to taper off so
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
we're not anticipating that to stay with
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
us at That level
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
um we are gonna uh we are trying to work
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
um towards the goal of trying to
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
convince people to stay buying license
 
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:11.900 align:start position:0%
and stay doing outdoor work
 
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you one of the biggest
 
00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:16.459 align:start position:0%
impacts or factors of that in my mind
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
was actually kids not being in school
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't just I wasn't just
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
keeping the adults busy it was keeping
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
the kids busy and now we're back in
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
school and sports are back going and all
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
the activities that kids do and it's
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
just it you know and I don't think
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room is not aware of it
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's hard for families to find time to
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
do to do extra things or do other things
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what will impact that
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
our license I'm sorry our
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
um registration fees on ohrvs uh went
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically up
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
um obviously uh most of that money we
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
ship over to Trails Bureau we don't keep
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
it here some of it goes to pay our in
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
our business office on a registration
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
some of it goes to pay for law
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities uh those figures
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
are up um and they will probably stay up
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
and if you think through it you know
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
these machines are you know anywhere
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 30 40 000 uh if you bought
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
one during covid chances are it's not
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you're not registering it
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
and you're not using it chances are
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're not going to sit on that type of
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
investment for very long before you
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
decide to sell it and hopefully the next
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
person will register it so we are
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
thinking that those registration levels
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
will somewhat stay as high as what we're
 
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
seeing currently
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.529 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
um

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of online registrations
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
um that would appear it seems like
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
um people are anxious to have that
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
available to them what's your timeline
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
our timeline
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
um what we uh offer to the legislature
 
00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299 align:start position:0%
is have it up and running by September
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
25 on renewals and then once we get that
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
done we would start working on uh um
 
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:00.500 align:start position:0%
original registrations my staff tells me
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh that in order the doing the original
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
you know an original registration
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more places where
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
um citizens can make mistakes and that
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
it becomes a lot more complicated a lot
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
more service involved in those in those
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
you think we might lose some people to
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont and other states by not having
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
an online product available sooner I
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
doubt very much you'll lose people of
 
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.690 align:start position:0%
doubt very much you'll lose people of
Vermont

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
um their trail system is not as well
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
developed as ours
 
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
um also and I'm Colonel Jordan will
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
probably have a better idea than I would
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
but I believe that they have an extra
 
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
fee for Trails over there that we don't
 
00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:39.419 align:start position:0%
have so it's I think it's a little bit
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
more expensive to ride over in Vermont
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
our true competitor is Maine and then it
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
becomes an issue of how far you're
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
willing to drive
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
especially not so much with ATVs but
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
when you get into snow machines
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
obviously that is heavily impacted by
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
weather we're coming off a year now
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
where we really didn't get we you know
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
we had a snowstorm earlier
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the snow
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
um kind of disappeared it was still in
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
the higher elevation still at the very
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
Northern tips of the tip of the state
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
but um there really wasn't much snow for
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
when I my my wife and I live in North
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
Stratford so I'm north of Groveton south
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
of Colebrook and we had four inches of
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
snow in the cornfield most of the winter
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
so there really wasn't a lot of snow
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
even up north there is now I talked to
 
00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
my wife this morning and she's out on
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
the skid steer plowing snow all morning
 
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.669 align:start position:0%
the skid steer plowing snow all morning
um

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
it uh so we do have you know we have
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
some snow now and they'll be they'll be
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
riding but just like down here you know
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
you've had one or two weekends we
 
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
probably had four or five up there that
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
Colonel would you join us yes sir
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
my name is Kevin Jordan I'm the chief of
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
law enforcement at New Hampshire Fish
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
and Game and I've been there for way too
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
long about 30 years now
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
um so the reason I came before you today
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
is we currently have 38 fuel wardens
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
working in the state men and women that
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
are working in the field I have four
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
administrative staff for a total number
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
of 42 officers covering everything from
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh to mass and from the Vermont
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
border to Maine
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
um we've had four open unfunded
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
positions for for about 10 years now
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
and for the last 10 years I've been
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
working as hard as I possibly could to
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
fill those positions uh because we are
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
short-handed just to give you an idea
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
State Police has almost 300 troopers on
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
the road city of Concord has 50 police
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
officers covering the city I'm trying to
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
cover the entire state with 38.
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so in 1970 we had 50 game wardens uh
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
out in the field and today we're
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
handling triple the calls for service uh
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
and search and rescue calls over what
 
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
they did back in the 70s so I kept
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
making this plea to the governor and to
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
anyone who would listen and he did
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
listen this year he was gracious enough
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
I I came up with a we came up with a
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
plan to fund two of those positions out
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
of our current budget so my plan is to
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
fund two of these open positions out of
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
the ohrv account
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
and I justify that based on the hours
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
that these officers are spending on oh
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
hrvs and forcing the the new uh boom of
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
ohrvs in the North country and so that
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
money has generated that the calls for
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
service have generated the reason and
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
the funding I have available so I plan
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
to fund two of those out of that the
 
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.070 align:start position:0%
to fund two of those out of that the
governor

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
approved that and then he also allowed
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
me to to hire the second pair for a
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
total of four uh and I advised him and
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
we advised him that we didn't have the
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
funding in the fish and game fund for
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
that so I would need that funded out of
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
General funds and I Justified that by
 
00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:58.580 align:start position:0%
explaining to him I did a lot of work on
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
how we spend our time and basically uh
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
one thing people don't realize a lot of
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the calls for service nuisance Wildlife
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
search and rescue calls bear nuisance
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
calls are being calls for service are
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
being demanded of our officers by folks
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
that haven't bought hunting their
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses so they haven't
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
contributed really other than to this to
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
the finances of the system other unless
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
they bought a hunting license and so
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
these officers are spending eight to ten
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
percent of their time responding to
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
these calls so
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
um asking for that to come out a general
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
fund to me two officers positions made
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
sense so that's the the bid that I put
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
in it didn't get written into the budget
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
was my understanding this year so I'm
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
here today asking for that funding for
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
those two positions to come out of
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
General funds and the total for that
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
would be and I'll get you I apologize
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
that I didn't bring anything in writing
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
today I will do that I was kind of short
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
notice that I was going to be here today
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
to present this but I will reduce this
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
all to writing and get it back to the
 
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.750 align:start position:0%
all to writing and get it back to the
committee

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
um this is going to be a cost of about a
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy one thousand dollars
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh each year in the biennium to fund
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
those two positions I I will tell you I
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
desperately need those and and a couple
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
of other things I would ask you to
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
consider so what happens to us is when
 
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
you have those 38 field offs on any
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
given day you have days off vacations so
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's rare that you have that many staff
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
on board so on an average day we're
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
working with 15 to 18 officers in the
 
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
field if I get a search and rescue call
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
that requires a carryout I need every
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
one of those officers to respond it
 
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
requires 20 people to carry someone at a
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
couple of miles down down a trail physic
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's very physically demanding and and
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
so what ends up happening and has
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
happened many times for us uh an officer
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
gets to the base of that trail we're
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
called to a second call and he turns
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
around and goes back up or or goes on
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
another call what I've noticed that this
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
is doing is it it is increased my injury
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
to my officers because they're tired and
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're getting hurt more which is
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
driving up our workman's comp cost but
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
more importantly as I'm calling in
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
officers more and more now on days off
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm requiring them through our labor
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
contract requires them to be on call 24
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
hours a day so I am reaching out to
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
officers on days off and making them or
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
requesting that they come back so that
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
we can conduct these missions that's
 
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
coming at a premium cost as payroll goes
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
up I'm paying some of those guys seventy
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour where I would be paying
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
them forty dollars an hour if they were
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
on a regular workday that's a huge
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
expense to our overtime and I noticed
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
that my overtime is climbing higher and
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
higher each year and so I see these four
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
positions as not curing that but
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
certainly helping it to balance off some
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
of that cost so so those are the things
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
that I would ask you to consider
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
um today on the television I heard that
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
somebody was in tuckerman's were being
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
caught in of lunch now um are there
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
I know Tech member Serene from my
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
younger days when you I used to go up
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
there all the time yeah
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
we never could go up there like in a
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
month of March because of the danger
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
um but it seems like people are
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
um going into parts of New Hampshire now
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
more frequently than ever before and
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
your folks are getting called out in the
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
worst of circumstances to help them
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
luckily some have the cards so you can
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
locate them right but some of them don't
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
have that that's correct um
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
are there any restrictions on as to
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
where people can go or do you need some
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
kind of safety measures in place so
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
people aren't killing themselves we've
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
tried and you're you are absolutely
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
correct they're getting more and more
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh more and more technical
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
those rescue missions are now we're
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
using ropes more and climbers more we
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
had to create a specialized team that we
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
train and equip at levels beyond the
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
regular game warden because of that but
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
I have never had any success
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
in my multiple years of discussions with
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
white Mountain National Forest and AMC
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
quite frankly to to put in any of those
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions so on a day as you saw in
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
the news where where the the possibility
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
of avalanche is high and will remain
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
high based on the snow the way that
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
we've got any snow it is perfect
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
Avalanche weather to not uh to to
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
restrict skiers there makes sense no
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
one's doing that and I've had no success
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
in getting that uh and so you watch this
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
kid sliding down the slope into the
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
Rocks literally I don't very fortunate
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
you survived that uh and I and I worry
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
that uh like in the weather we had two
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
weeks ago where it was 60 below zero on
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
top of Mount Washington it was in the
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
80s 80s 80 below and that challenges
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
people to go up there and try to survive
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
that so again that cost the state of New
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of money and I don't
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
know how to stop that I'd be all on
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
board with that if we could restrict
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
that but it's a it's a slippery slope I
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
think we'll tell you
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
I do whatever chance I get
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler was was the author
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh of and extremely helpful in getting
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
that hike safe card passed we were in
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
financial Straits without that that this
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
past year produced 200 000 which was
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
half of the cost of my rescues for the
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
year for the State of New Hampshire that
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
was a big bonus to the department I
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
fight to keep it because everybody tries
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
to change it it's a great program I
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't want it messed with and we're
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
doing very well with it so
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes that was a plan that came from this
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
house that has worked very well so
 
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.990 align:start position:0%
house that has worked very well so
senator

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
no that's right that's right but it's a
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
help it's it's at least they're at least
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
paying for some of that service which is
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
important and it gives us an opportunity
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
to sell the safety points too that's
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
what we've used it for
 
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.210 align:start position:0%
what we've used it for
so

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.909 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:03.169 align:start position:0%
uh
Mike

00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to run away from this thing
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
I know that feeling
 
00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:18.350 align:start position:0%
I know that feeling
um

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
so that you're requesting for
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
full-time employees two are gonna are
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
you gonna two are going to be able to
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
come from ohrv that's correct and two
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
have to come from general fund that's
 
00:29:32.289 --> 00:29:32.299 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you thank you sir
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
um two questions
 
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.409 align:start position:0%
um two questions
um

00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
unfortunate is not a strong enough word
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
um deaths yes um people up there and
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
um we all know
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
what was so unfortunate about it
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
um it used to be that
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
if you were totally ill prepared if you
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
were not following that then
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
the victim or the victim's family was
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
pursued for funding for a rescue
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
um is that still the case and my second
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
question is can you just give a brief
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
overview of how your officers are
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
trained yes so to answer the question on
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
billing we still the legislature has
 
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
allowed us to that was one of the
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
solutions when we made multiple runs
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
back to fund search and rescue so they
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
allow us to Bill try and recover the
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
cost from Reckless hiking I've never
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
done it with a fatality I've never gone
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
to a family after a loss of a child or
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
or a loved one and asked to be paid
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I could probably certainly in the in
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
little Emily's case I could have she was
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
she was it was unbelievably preventable
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
there were three right in a row that's
 
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.029 align:start position:0%
there were three right in a row that's
correct

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and and so I could have in that case
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
but I've never done that we do bill so
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
we do 180 excuse me 180 to 185 missions
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
a year I bill on average 10 to 12 of
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
those that Meet The Reckless standard
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
that both the Attorney General's office
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
and we agree and will then in fact bill
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
um I came before the house this year
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
because uh part of that law allowed us
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
or or required us to suspend driver's
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
licenses if in fact they didn't pay that
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
bill I've only used that when I've got
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
people that refuse to contact us at all
 
00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:18.419 align:start position:0%
to have any contact with us so I'm over
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
here this year trying to get that link
 
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
that language strengthened because it
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
was never written correctly
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
um but uh and so we do do that we end up
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
setting up payment plans it's uh it's
 
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.070 align:start position:0%
setting up payment plans it's uh it's
probably

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
it probably cost us money quite frankly
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't save me a lot but you know
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
what it does it's two things it does
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
that I owe us dollar press I can't
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
measure one is I know for a fact it
 
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
prevents some of these missions I don't
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
know how to
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
follow that to tell you how many but
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
when people think about getting a bill
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
it causes them to take a thought because
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
they call me and they'll ask me what's
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
the appropriate gear I should bring
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
what's the and that never used to happen
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
so it is a good thing and I don't want
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
to lose it but we don't use it often for
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
those reasons and I would never bill for
 
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
a child or a fatality we just never
 
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
would do that our training if we receive
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
the same training as any police officer
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so we're
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
training criminal law we're trained in
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game law I we give them a
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
little added training when they come out
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the academy to address the issues
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
they're going to face as a game award so
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
things like the bio biological end of it
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
how to deal with a bear complaint how to
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
load litters how to do search and rescue
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
search and rescue
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
and the training that the officers
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
receive to ride the specialized
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
equipment remember when when an officer
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
comes on I'm giving them a boat
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes more than one boat depending
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
on their patrols a small boat a bigger
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
boat for the bigger bodies we're giving
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
them an ATV or a dirt bike to respond to
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
enforce oh HIV laws we're training them
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
to ride a snow machine so they're
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
getting all of that training and then
 
00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
they all receive search and rescue
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
training I have 16 of them
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
that get search and rescue training
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the rest so those are
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
the guys that we guys and gals that we
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
send above Tree Line uh in the winter
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
time I won't send a regular game warden
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
up today I would send only someone from
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
that specialized team we equip them with
 
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:13.820 align:start position:0%
more expensive more technical equipment
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
and they are training
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
um constantly throughout the year along
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
with my dive team that that is very
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
similar so those guys receive levels of
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
training much greater and that is an
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
ongoing thing they're getting
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
30 40 hours of training a year just in
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
that regard alone to be able to do what
 
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
the other point that I want to make
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
and I know you I know you're busy and I
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate you entertaining this but
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
when you send officers up to bring down
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
a kid
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's frozen that they literally
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
chiseled out of the ice and brought down
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's not a normal thing for anyone to
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
and you know I was there in that day I
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
went up there that day because my staff
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
had been there for four days and it was
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
a brutal rescue and I did a lot of them
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
when I was a real game warden in the
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
field so I know what it takes and you
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
know I go around and talk to those guys
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
quietly and I say you know this is this
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
is a bet no it's okay it's what we do
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
well it isn't what you do no one does
 
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.419 align:start position:0%
that and when you repeatedly expose
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
these same individuals to this there's
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
there's a price for that there's a price
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
physically and there's a price
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
emotionally and when you have short
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
staff numbers that increases that issue
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the motivation that I
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
come back and ask for more people is
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
because you need to spell these guys out
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes from that I had the same crew
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
that brought Emily down went up four
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
days later and brought another young man
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
down in the same condition that's not
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
normal and there aren't a lot of
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
agencies that are put in that position
 
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.770 align:start position:0%
agencies that are put in that position
so

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
I have quite a few questions oh okay
 
00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
I have quite a few questions oh okay
um

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't think people realize
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
how many people it takes for a carryout
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
they don't and they don't I know that um
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm from Conway and the Conway Village
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
fire district used to go in there and
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
and get people out and it takes eight or
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
ten people and then and uh
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
it it can go on for hours right you can
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know I did it for I've had both my
 
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
shoulders replaced and and I can tell
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
you it was it was due to rescues so
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
you're carrying a strap across your back
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
and holding a person in a litter 150 to
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
180 pounds sometimes more in a litter
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
and you're off trail that unfortunately
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
the litter is over the trail you're
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
walking off that trail and it beats you
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
up yeah and the only way and what
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
happens is you've gotta you've got to
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
turn these people you've got to turn
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
these people over because you're going
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
to end up dropping the patient so you
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
got to have people to rotate in and out
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
so it requires you're right it requires
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of people thank goodness for
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
volunteers because we the professional
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
volunteers that we use because we
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it without them with 38
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
officers I would not be able to do it
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
can can you just give a ballpark figure
 
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
of what it average an average number of
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
people that it takes to carry somebody
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
out I know what varies but no so in on a
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
mile carryout a mile to a two mile
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
carrier which quite frankly is probably
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
the average you you're gonna you
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to do that with less than
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
20 people you would want 20 people 20.
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes you would need 20 people thank you
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
effectively we've done it with less but
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
you but ideally you would want 20 people
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
yeah so once you get there you have to
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
call for additional violence absolutely
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
you do absolutely you do and that's why
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'm calling guys in on days off yeah and
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're not liking that either right
 
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
right that's not fair to them frankly
 
00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:49.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned a lot about the price
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
that your officers are paying for this
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know deeply tragic service they have
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
um and you did mention that workman comp
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
workman's comp is up
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the Department my my question is
 
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:14.540 align:start position:0%
is there any sort of um crisis you know
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
provide Provisions to these team members
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know for their for their emotional
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
mental well and I'm laughing because we
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
we would just the last conversation I
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
had at my office before coming over here
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
was over that exact issue so we have a
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
psychologist that is asked to put on a
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
class for us tomorrow and I've mandated
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
that the officers go and bring their
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
spouses with them so
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
um so we do get that and I did it and
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
before I got this position uh I was in
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
critical incident debriefer for the
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
agency due to a shooting I was in years
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
ago so I would go around and do that we
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't backfilled that that's
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
something that we need to do I think
 
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:52.910 align:start position:0%
something that we need to do I think
um

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
but because these new kids don't share
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
like the older guys did that's it's a
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
different personality and I have real
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about that moving forward but
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
yes we do bring that in we recognize
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
that that in the old days that was not
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
allowed in law enforcement you sucked
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
that up and that's just foolish that's
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
not wise business because you've got a
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
lot of money invested in these people
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
and I want to get 20 years out of them
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
I've got hundreds of thousands of
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
dollars in them and and not only do I
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
want them healthy which is really what I
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
want I sell it because we've invested
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
this kind of money so you need to pay
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
for this training so that they we keep
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:34.930 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:34.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I really appreciate
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
it I have about five different questions
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
because they accumulated and just as a
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
heads up after this I will have to
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
briefly head out there is somebody who I
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
need to be out there for
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
so let me start by again thanking you
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
for taking the questions and uh I just
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
everything correctly you were talking
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
earlier about the hives psych safe card
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly that's a voluntary
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
program that is a voluntary people can
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
choose to use it they get extra benefits
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
from having it but it's a voluntary
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
program it is Sir I mean I don't see why
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
anybody would want to tweak with a
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
voluntary program that seems to benefit
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
everyone and I will you know say that we
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
need to if anything extend it and look
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
at what changes we can make to it to
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
make it more useful you were talking
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
earlier about the um situations where
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
the conditions are dangerous but you
 
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
cannot ban people from going out and
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
frankly I think enforcing that ban would
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
be amazingly difficult for you anyway
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
because you cannot exactly you know
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
Patrol those areas I'm I just want to
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that we do inform people of
 
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
the dangerous conditions
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
and then you know they make their own
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
choices that involve risk but we do have
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
a system to notify them that there is an
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
avalanche risk or the weather is too
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
cold up and you shouldn't go up how do
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
we do that so we have a number of ways
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
we do that when Governor sununu first
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
took over we had three at a fishing
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
there we had three people go through the
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
ice I don't know if anyone remembers
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
that last a few years ago uh it was it
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
was a tragedy unfolding and he wanted to
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
shut the lake down I'll never forget
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
that phone call he said we got to shut
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
down Lake Winnipesaukee I said Governor
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know how I could do that he said
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'll deploy the guard and we'll do that
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
I said you you cannot manage that what
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
we need to do and he helped me he was a
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
great help I said what we need to do is
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
we need to do a public service campaign
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
and tell people this is dangerous and
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
this is how you avoid that danger so I
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
do that a lot on Channel Nine I do it
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
with a whole host of different officers
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
and in fact almost to the point where
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's at nauseam I think but but I think
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
that's the best way to do it and channel
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
9 has been very good to us all our press
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
releases have a paragraph at the bottom
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
talking about that the dangers and how
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
to the 10 10 essential hiking items that
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
you should have in your pack so we do a
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
huge Public Service campaign through the
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
press for that exact thing now at the at
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington they post where
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
hikers arrive at tuckerman's there's a
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
big sign up there that's updated daily
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
due to dangers the problem is people
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
walk right by it
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
but but the sign is there we do a lot to
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
warn people so that should be no
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
surprise we can only do so much I mean
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we'll never be
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
able to put them in a cocoon and keep
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
them safe there is risk in involved in
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
any outdoor activity we should continue
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
to educate and inform people and hoping
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
that they will learn from other other
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
people's mistakes sure you were also
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
talking earlier about the billing for
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
Rescue and your you know attempts to
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
collect and how you are trying to be
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
considerate of you know the
 
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
considerate of you know the
circumstances

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a numbers person do you have a
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
collection percentage on those attempts
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
to build how much do we end up
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
recovering you were saying that it may
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
not even make sense financially but it's
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
more of a deterrent last year we covered
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
62 percent of the ones I build so a
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
couple over half and the reason I know
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
that as I just presented these figures
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
to the outdoor Council
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
um we sold 211
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
000 worth of hikesafe cards we build 12
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
hikers total of that 12 and I I
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
apologize I didn't bring those numbers
 
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
with me but I calculated how much we
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
build and how much we collected but it
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
was a 62 just looking for a ballpark and
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
you really am trying to get the feeling
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
by the way 62 percent is a really high
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
rate of recovery I mean it's pretty good
 
00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
those are a lot of the times they're not
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
people who have the resources and what
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
are you gonna do you cannot you know get
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
blood out of us and we just so you know
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
we we will negotiate that because
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
depending on so they all press always
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
asking what's an average rescue that's
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
very difficult to answer because they
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
can run as as little as 1000 dollars and
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
they can run as high as a hundred
 
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
thousand depending on what you're using
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
for resources and some of these
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
helicopter rescues if I was built for
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
the helicopter they'd be over over
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
they'd take my whole budget for one
 
00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:53.390 align:start position:0%
they'd take my whole budget for one
rescue

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
rescue
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
um but so we negotiate that you can't
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
bill someone forty thousand dollars and
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
expect them to be able to pay that so
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
I've called them and negotiated that
 
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.230 align:start position:0%
I've called them and negotiated that
down

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
um and and I suppose you have to do that
 
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:08.339 align:start position:0%
carefully it just it just never made
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
sense to me to expect someone to be able
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
to pay a thirty five thousand dollar
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
bill when they're renting an apartment
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
and on the key frankly most people who
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
could pay that probably know better than
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
to cause a rescue right so we reduce it
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
and we'll agree on a price and then set
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
them up with a time payment I think
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're managing it in a very very
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate way and I appreciate the
 
00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:29.089 align:start position:0%
appropriate way and I appreciate the
details

00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:29.099 align:start position:0%
details
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
um one is slightly less comfortable
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
question if I may there was a bill
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
earlier that didn't make it through on
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh you know the warrantless search power
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the fission game people I just want
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
to ask Point Blank
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
whether you guys have the policies in
 
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that that power is
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
used strictly for fish and game purposes
 
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
and not for any other lawyer we
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely do and one thing that it the
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
testimony in that was very misleading
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
had you if you had gone to the committee
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh the the when I wrote that statute
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
myself I wrote the last paragraph when
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
we got motor vehicle Powers when we got
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle Powers because we were
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
stumbling on to driving people that were
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
driving that were impaired and we didn't
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
have the if I pulled someone over who
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
was impaired when I was out working
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
night Hunters at night that guaranteed
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
that individual would be found not
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
guilty in a courtroom because I didn't
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do that so I
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
brought that before the legislature and
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
I said that makes no sense we need to
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
have we're trained the same levels State
 
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
Police can enforce all of our laws we're
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
allowed to enforce all of theirs with
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
the exception motor vehicle I would ask
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
that we do motor vehicle and the concern
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
came up about our abilities to check
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
folks in the field a little added it's
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
not really extra power but we are
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
allowed by law so to look to see if you
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
have a number of fish if you've been
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
able you know if we have we have to have
 
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion you can't just
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
guess at that you have to have a reason
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
you have to see it happening or suspect
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
that it's happening and you have to be
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
able to articulate that when you go to
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
court so that was a concern in Motor
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so I wrote right in that statue
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
had he read the entire statute I wrote
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
right in there fish and game officers
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
will have will be able to stop motor
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle with no additional Authority
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
than any other licensed or certified
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
police officer which means I can do
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
nothing more on the highway than a
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
trooper can which is the way it should
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
be which I appreciate a clarification
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
please note this is my first term so I
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
really have a lot to learn and I get
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
very frustrated watching that live on
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
the house floor knowing that the
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
information being provided is absolutely
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
false the other thing I will tell you is
 
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.589 align:start position:0%
false the other thing I will tell you is
this

00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
just remember the world that we live in
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
today the scrutiny that law enforcement
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
is under some degrees that's a good
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
thing because it's cleaned us up I think
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
in some areas outside of the State of
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's required this is
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
not the time that you would get away
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
with any of those extra Powers the
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court would snap those away from
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
you this particular law has gone before
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire Supreme Court three
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
separate times and been upheld all three
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
of those times it's 80 years worth of of
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
judicial review if there was a problem
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
it would have changed a long time ago I
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and I'm gonna you know my
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
last question is uh totally different
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
one it's the happy one for the end
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
all those volunteers that help us with
 
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
bring something to thank them and to
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
show them our appreciation any perks
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
anything we can do for them to again
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
show them that you know we genuinely
 
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.329 align:start position:0%
show them that you know we genuinely
appreciate

00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
oh yes so you the legislature has given
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
us the ability to cover them Insurance
 
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
wise so when those folks come we have to
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
jump through some hoops they have to be
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
not just a necessarily a person off the
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
street but some of these professional uh
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
volunteers that train with us we sign
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
them up to become temporary employees if
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
you will so they're covered for
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
workman's comp so if one of them gets
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
injured we can we can pay their medical
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
expenses doesn't happen often but when
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
it does happen it's nice to be able to
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
cover that we also provide them with we
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
have a group excuse me called The
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
Outdoor Council
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
which is a group of board members to
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
include officers from my agency they get
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
we solicit donations for the search and
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
rescue so you'll have like Emily
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
sotelo's family has donated thousands of
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
dollars for the work that was done we
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
give it to the outdoor Council and that
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
money is used to I forbid any of my
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
officers or any of our agency to get any
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
of that because we're being paid so that
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
all goes to the volunteers when we
 
00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
purchase radios for them we purchase
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
clothing for them we train for them we
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
play softball with them we take them out
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
whenever we can so we treat them it's a
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
very good relationship I appreciate that
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
and again we would be lost without those
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
folks thank you that's why I'm asking
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
because as I said you know I'm new to
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
all of this and it seems that it's only
 
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
right that we show them you know how
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
much we appreciate it and again I'll
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
have to step or for a few minutes I
 
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
representative buco
 
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh Colonel is it colonel Kevin is fine
 
00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:07.790 align:start position:0%
uh Colonel is it colonel Kevin is fine
sir

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
um as I recall when we approved that
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle provision yes it will
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
speak the main reason was because of a
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
lot of the traffic coming out of Jericho
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
and going in into town right so what's
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
happening with the park now because it
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
seems like uh
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
I think it's when I see the trailers
 
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
going through Conway I I know it's busy
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
up there they've that we they have we've
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
all done I think a better job of getting
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
a handle on that when that exploded
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
things were a little in disarray we had
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
roads opened up we still have roads
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
opened up a lot of the local PDS didn't
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
want to get involved in it uh we've
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
changed a lot of that mindset now I
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
think we're all working in the same
 
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.270 align:start position:0%
think we're all working in the same
direction

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
um you know we're doing details in the
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
summertime up at the park I'm working
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
some of those in the on the weekends in
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
the summer because we're short-handed
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
um so that the park has really done a
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
good job at corralling those issues so
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
and you're correct part of the motor
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
vehicle issue came it came a little
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
ahead of that but it but it would it
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
helps us to address them driving down
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
the roads in addition to the Fish and
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
Game law we can force so it was a it
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
just made sense to do that and I don't
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
know why it wasn't ever done but but
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's it works well and you're not not
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
out I don't have staff enough to have
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
them out on 93 running a radar gun and
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
you won't see them doing that or they're
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
going to be looking for work because
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
there's too many other things for them
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
to do what I said to them and and tell
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
them routinely is
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
if someone runs a red light when I'm
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
going home and puts another person in
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
danger I will stop that vehicle I'm not
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to stop a guy who goes by me on 93
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
probably 10 miles over the speed limit
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly that's not my job
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
but if it's creating a hazard to people
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
and it's placing people in danger then I
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
I want these officers to address that
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
and they've been doing that there hasn't
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
been a lot of that Vehicles being
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
stopped but they use it in those extreme
 
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.050 align:start position:0%
stopped but they use it in those extreme
cases

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that response I I
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
think it was more of
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
or oh hiv's coming off the trails and
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
going down the sidewalks right yeah
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
that's that has gotten better not that
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
we don't have issues still but it is it
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
is improved it has improved thank you
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question do I
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
recall correctly that you have a K-9
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
unit or the canines belong to your
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
professional volunteers no so well we
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
have five canine units of our own that
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
we have funded without any state money
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
so we have we have I have a very
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
successful very highly regarded canine
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
program that I didn't have anything to
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
do with but I have officers that created
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
it that is all funded through uh
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
donations I'm very proud of that
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
um because it is some of the officers
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
are some of the best equipped in New
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
England and we don't pay anything for
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
that not a state budget money
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
we also use a group we've used for years
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
New England K-9 I will use them when we
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
have a situation where there's no danger
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
involved so those are civilian people
 
00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
that have trained their dogs their scent
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
dogs and they're part of our volunteer
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
base I use our dogs for the criminal
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
um element of it although my dogs are
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
not bite dogs they're search dogs but
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
these dogs have been you our dogs have
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
also been used in the last number of
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
homicides in the state to include the
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
Concord homicide here they found the
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
evidence that would end up getting that
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
guy arrested they found the gun up on 93
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the medium for the young man who
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
killed his stepmother and children
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
brother or sister remember in Northfield
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
so those dogs are being called Down by
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
State Police because of their abilities
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
we also use New England K-9 which are
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
tracking dogs the volunteer base so we
 
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
right uh Colonel um
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
let me get this straight now oh Civil
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
Air Patrol how much interaction do you
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
have with them and uh I know I was on
 
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.220 align:start position:0%
the last year I went up on a training
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
Mission uh you know a fake mission to uh
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
and they showed me how it works with
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
that kernel we use them a lot actually
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
we use them the limitations that we have
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
with civil air patrols they're fixed
 
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
Wing aircraft so their ability to
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
um to fly and see what we need
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
um is is a lot of times too high I still
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
we still use them as a resource you call
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
out a mission number as you know and you
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
go through the you jump through the
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
Hoops to use them for that I use you
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
know what I use more of they are they
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
are the go-to organization for forensic
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
phone work
 
00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:50.900 align:start position:0%
they can pinpoint phone calls for me
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 calls they are the group that has
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
been able to narrow down locations when
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
we've had a caller call in and either uh
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't couldn't make another call or
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
his phone went dead uh Civil Air Patrol
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
has done an outstanding job with pinning
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
that down for us so we we use them I use
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
their ground crew sometimes when I can I
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
don't use them in the winter time
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to come in the
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
winter but they'll they'll work in the
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
summer so we use them I think they would
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
like us to use them more
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
that I'm always getting pushed back from
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
them but frankly when I when I need
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
someone to fly at Treetop level or lower
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
my team out on a cable or pick a victim
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
up there's only one group in the state
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire can do that and that's
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
our Army Air National Guard uh those
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
Pilots are amazing and we we train with
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
them we can communicate with them and
 
00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:41.900 align:start position:0%
it's a helicopter so it gives me more
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
ability to use them in more scenarios
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
but we use the fixed wings for these
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
long-term searches like Emily I know we
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
use Civil Air Patrol for Emily those
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
four days that we were on Lafayette so
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
we use them quite a bit yeah it's very
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
difficult to see from that altitude let
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
me tell you yes it's not yes and I don't
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
want them to ever hear me say that
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
because they get quite offended by that
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
but it's just it's just common sense
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
they're flying an aircraft at as
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler I know is is has
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
done at very high distances and and a
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
lot of these times I need a helicopter
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
ride a treetop and uh right and the
 
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:20.099 align:start position:0%
guard is I use state police helicopters
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
too we use those as well but the guard
 
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
is really what has helped us the most it
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
has saved lives for us right and one
 
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
other question uh Wireless could you go
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
through the scenario of you know like I
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned it you touched upon it
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
as far as if someone if an officer sees
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
someone say fishing yes it's not
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
supposed to that's something yep that's
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
probable cause right that's right
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion could you go
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
through the warrantless
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
if you let's say you
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
realize that you probably oh the officer
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
needs a warrant yep what what could you
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
go through that scenario sure so I can
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
give you a couple of different scenarios
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
that happens so typically what happens
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
is I will watch a fisherman
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
and I've seen him catch one or two fish
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
and he I'm watching him with binoculars
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
which is what we do every day and he's
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
putting them in a basket or a cooler or
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
a bag or in his coat pocket so I know
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
that he has at least caught two for
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
instance and he's put them in this
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
location now I have articulable
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
suspicion which is different from
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
probable cause probable cause is a much
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
higher level probable cause is better
 
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
than greater than 51 percent I can prove
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
that he has committed an offense
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
articable suspicion is I think he did I
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
need more evidence to prove that that's
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
what gets a motor vehicle stop I think
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
he's speeding because my radar says he
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
is so I'm gonna pull him over you don't
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
need a search warrant to do that you're
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
pulling him over you're asking him for
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
his driver's license if he's been
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
drinking you're getting him out you're
 
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
getting it you're doing a test that's
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
all searching that are allowed police
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
officers are allowed to do but getting
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
back to my scenario my guys put his fish
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
in his pocket so now I've decided rather
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
than sit there I want to go check him so
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
I go down the bank we have a very
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
friendly conversation
 
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
um how's the fishing today it's it's
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
good or it's not good did you catch any
 
00:56:10.859 --> 00:56:12.230 align:start position:0%
good or it's not good did you catch any
fish

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
fish
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
now his response to that could mean one
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
of two things if he says yes then then
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's not going to help my articable
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion much other than I know he's
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
got some and I know he's got them
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
because I've seen him if he says no
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
he's helped me a lot because I know he's
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
caught at least two because I watched
 
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:30.770 align:start position:0%
caught at least two because I watched
him

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
so I am within my rights under that law
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
to now say to him do you mind showing me
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
those fish now I could go in his coat
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
without doing that I would fire an
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
officer if he did that you can't do that
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
to people there's nothing wrong with
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
saying I saw you catch a couple of fish
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
or I'd like to see the fish you caught
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
today and you know 99 of the time he'll
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
pull the fish out and show them to you
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
once in a while they won't and now if
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
say he doesn't do I have articable
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
suspicion to go in there I certainly do
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
I certainly do
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
that doesn't give you our checkable
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
suspicion to go into his front pants
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
pocket okay because there's no trout in
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
that you saw it go in the code that
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
better be where you go do you understand
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
that if you go into the pants pocket you
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't have a reason to do that and so
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
now if you fi if you want to go into
 
00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
those pants pockets and because you
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
think he has uh you get up there and you
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
can smell the odor of uh well marijuana
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
is probably not good to use but it's
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
what I used to because it's legal in
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
some places now but if you if you saw
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
what you believe to be
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
um or a suspected drug activity it
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow you to go in there and get
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
that you would have to stop at that
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
point and hold him make a decision that
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to hold him and go apply
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
for a search warrant and you would have
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
to apply for that did you do that online
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
so the testimony of that is very
 
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.390 align:start position:0%
so the testimony of that is very
inaccurate

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
there in the old days I would go find a
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
friend of mine a judge and I'd go to his
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
house I've been to campgrounds I've been
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
to their camps I go to their homes that
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
has all stopped you can't do that any
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
longer now they put judges on call and
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
you have to do it telephonically over on
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
the phone and so that would require so I
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
could call a judge on the phone and give
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
him my probable cause that I need for a
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
warrant I have to have a little more
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
than just a suspicion for that and then
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
I have to go somewhere where I can send
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
him that information in an affidavit so
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
I have to have a computer to do that
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
this this testimony you can do that with
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
a phone is nonsense you need to have
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
something in writing you have to swear
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
that that is the truth the way you swear
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
is you become an affient by signing that
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
so that's not done on the phone we just
 
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
did we've got a big case that you're
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
going to see hit the news here very soon
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
which will be very alarming and we've
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
been working on it for months and it
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
involved us getting search warrants for
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
telephones and computers and we got I
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
think we're up to 12 or 14 different
 
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
applications for warrants that we
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
applied for and again the testimony made
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
it sound like we don't ever do that we
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
do it regularly just like any other
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
police officer does
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
in one scenario that I was involved in
 
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
we applied for that warrant at 10
 
00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning we never heard
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
back from the judge until five that
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
evening now in this particular case it
 
00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:14.339 align:start position:0%
wasn't a big deal because they didn't
 
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
know we were coming back to get the
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
phone if I've got a guy standing on a
 
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.589 align:start position:0%
phone if I've got a guy standing on a
brook

00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
brook
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
I can't hold him there for the day I
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
can't tie up a lobster boat and look at
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
a fisherman who's trying to make a
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
living and say you're going to have to
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
wait till four above until we get the
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
judge you know I'm gonna get we're going
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
to get killed doing that that's just not
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable that is why in every state in
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
they allow us the Opera the ability to
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
go in and look for these things without
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
the warrant that's the whole reason for
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
that is it's not conducive it's not as
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
easy as people think we can do it and
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
we're required to I cannot go into a
 
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
home ever
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
without a search warrant thank God
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
I mean I'd be the first one to object to
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm a firm believer in our
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
constitution you cannot go into people's
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
homes you're not going to open people's
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
trunks you're going to have search
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
warrants for that stuff
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
in spite of what anyone tells you that
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
isn't done and I have asked repeatedly
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
when this bill has come before the house
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
seven times I think now give me one just
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
one example of an officer or a scenario
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
where that was done to this day you've
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
not heard one and you didn't that day
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
because they don't exist it's never
 
01:00:22.859 --> 01:00:23.809 align:start position:0%
because they don't exist it's never
happened

01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
and and as long as it doesn't that rule
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
should never change if it happens then
 
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
yes we should jump all over that but I
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
can tell you the courts will do it for
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
you the courts would accept less
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
nonsense today than ever in my 33-year
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
career I might have gotten away with
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
something my first five years today you
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
are not going to get away with anything
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
like that so so it's not as easy as
 
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
people think
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:00:52.809 --> 01:00:52.819 align:start position:0%
um that's a long answer I'm sorry
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
wow mine's in a completely different
 
01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:56.809 align:start position:0%
wow mine's in a completely different
subject

01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
um do you ever use um drone technology
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
so we just again through a donation I
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
had an officer apply a young officer who
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
created the uh
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
turkey registration the director was
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
talking about that same officer is a is
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
a drone fanatic I did not know this he
 
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
came to me with a proposal a very well
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
crafted one uh he sold me on it we
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
applied for a grant through the wildlife
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
Heritage Foundation so because we didn't
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
have the money in the budget for that
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
they awarded the Grant and so we are
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
purchasing a drone to start that so
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
we'll see how that goes
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
it'll be very tricky because of FAA
 
01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
rules and other other limitations and
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
flying it above four thousand feet above
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
tree line but it's just going to be
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
another tool in the toolbox that we hope
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
to use so
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
represent oh chairman whyler
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I usually get a
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
solicitation a couple times a year from
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
non-game and fishing they send me the
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
wild lines I don't think I've gotten one
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.250 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:06.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
it must be an oversight because I do
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
know that they've gone out because I'll
 
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
make sure to I look down usually see I
 
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
look down I haven't seen a check that I
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
sent to him lately so okay and I you
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
know I think that's good even though
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's a small piece of the program it's
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry I have one
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
final question thank you Mr chair with
 
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
all the donations
 
01:02:31.859 --> 01:02:32.510 align:start position:0%
all the donations
um

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
how was that captured is there an
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
accounting process for the donations
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
that you are given
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like a lot
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
of we get a lot of law enforcement I've
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
I've gotten a million dollar safe boat
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
just recently we got a airboat that was
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars that was
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
that was through donations I just got a
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar donation from a
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
former senator who wanted to help out
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
with search uh searching uh search and
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
rescue missions so we we go to uh
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
commission for approval on each one of
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
these from so we'll name the the donor
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
and the amount and then anything 2500
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
and above Kath we go to G and C governor
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
and Council so that's approved and then
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
that is added I'm also Kathy is is my
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
guardian for that and I can tell you you
 
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to cross Kathy so she is very
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
strict about where that money goes so if
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
money was provided to us for search and
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
rescue that's the account you put it in
 
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
if money isn't provided for a canine
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's the account line that that you
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
deposit that in and that does show I our
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
budget correct
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you very
 
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you very
much

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
I still have one more thing good job
 
01:03:57.359 --> 01:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
I still have one more thing good job
shoot

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
shoot
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%

agency request efficiency budget and
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
then we had our prioritized needs per
 
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
the instructions within those
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs we had nine unfunded
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
positions that were within those columns
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
in one newly created position called a
 
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.370 align:start position:0%
in one newly created position called a
7D

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
7D
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
four of those unfunded positions were
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor's office and
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
those are the conservation officers that
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
the colonel and the director have
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
alluded to those are represented within
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
our budget that is before you
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
I am here because I requested that a
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
position that used to reside within the
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
department that was taken from us
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
I asked for to be re-established and it
 
01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
was denied by the governor's office back
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
in 2013 I had an accounting technician
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
leave a grade 14 when the legislature
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
created uh The Authority for das to
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
create the shared services Center for
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
accounts payable and Human Resources
 
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.569 align:start position:0%
accounts payable and Human Resources
functions

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
functions
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
so my one and only accounts payable
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
position was taken from fish and game
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
and put over with the shared services
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
Center to process accounts payable
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
however half of the accounts payable
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
duties that went along with her position
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
were left at the agency
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
processing requisitions research
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
customer service with vendors the only
 
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
thing that went with Vivian in position
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
number 13910 was the data entry
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
component of accounts payable
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
as you may be aware if you were here at
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
the time in 2017 the shared services
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
Center was disbanded because it was not
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
the efficient module that we were all
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
kind of led to believe it was going to
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
be when it was disbanded agencies were
 
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
provided an opportunity to get the
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
positions back that were grabbed from
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
them in 2013.
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
in the meantime during that 40-year
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
period of time the position that was
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
taken from fish and game had retired she
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
very much did not like the shared
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
services Center she retired early so at
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
the time her position number her
 
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
full-time position number was abolished
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
by Das so I had no full-time position
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
number two come back to fish and games
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
so I didn't have anybody to claim
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
so because of the um kind of balance in
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
the fish and game fund and this is a
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
full-time Fish and Game funded position
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
within the business office as most of us
 
01:07:27.059 --> 01:07:28.370 align:start position:0%
within the business office as most of us
are

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
I decided along then with uh director
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
Normandale that we would just absorb
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
those accounts payable duties at the
 
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.990 align:start position:0%
those accounts payable duties at the
time

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
but due to the increase in the workload
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
as program areas have increased accounts
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
payables have increased our grants our
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
volume of Grants have increased the
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing card
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
I asked for this position to be
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
re-established within the department the
 
01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.270 align:start position:0%
re-established within the department the
governor

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:08:04.849 --> 01:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
decided not to fund it so I am here
 
01:08:07.569 --> 01:08:07.579 align:start position:0%

first agency to come forward with this
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
issue with a gopher funding on our aot
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
program where the go for money is going
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
to run out you know we it's not in our
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
regular budget because it was funded
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
through the Gopher program so the money
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
Runs Out uh halfway through fiscal 25
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we're asking to maintain that
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
program which means right now that's you
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
know we need to put that as us we have
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
to have the authority to spend money we
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
have to find the money someplace to
 
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
spend so my I just want to remind folks
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
my request to you folks was to add that
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
as a spend line item
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%

permit from Des and there are endangered
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
or threatened species on the property
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
that you wish to develop
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you you receive notification of that
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
and then you have to file with phishing
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
game and we come up with a plan to
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate possible damages to those
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
species as part of that when I came on
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
prior to me coming on there was a
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that that radically changed the
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
EES is that basically threw out their
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
law the new law came in we came in with
 
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
new regs and it it it was a very slow
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
process we were not able to keep the
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
pace up we have since we written our
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
regulations and working with the
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
governor we received this go for funding
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
to staff this program at its at it at a
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
level that that we're able to keep up to
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
Pace part of the issue would go for
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
um you gotta remember there's a lot of
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
federal money coming into the state of
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now so we're
 
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
probably seeing a higher level of
 
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
development more applications right now
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
than what we may see
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know on the other side of all this
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
federal spending so it's kind of part of
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
it is temporary that's the reason why we
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
don't have a firm plan to put forth
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
because right now you know we're not
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
exactly sure I need four people or maybe
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
I need two people or maybe I need three
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
people long haul these positions were
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
all created as temporary positions so
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we have flexibility with that and
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
we will be continuing to study this as
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
we go forward
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
but the big issue was is that you know
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
we did not put it into our budget for
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
this last six months and if we stopped
 
01:13:15.179 --> 01:13:16.130 align:start position:0%
this last six months and if we stopped
um

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
it would endanger
 
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.030 align:start position:0%
it would endanger
um

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
not being a lawyer but my my um
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
my opinion would be that it would
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
probably endanger t e species on
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
developmental sites because of the laws
 
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
that we have right now on the books we
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
have X number of days to do the review
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
if we don't if we like Des we don't do
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
the review then then it's considered a
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes so there'd be no protection for T
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
you know it would not be significant
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
protection for tne species on
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
development sites
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh threaten and endangered sir
 
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.290 align:start position:0%
uh threaten and endangered sir
um

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
have you always done this or before
 
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
gopher did it go through Des we no it's
 
01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:00.179 align:start position:0%
always been a fishing game but prior to
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit the it was not quite as
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
complicated of a process so this is this
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
the uh post lawsuit the rules are a
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated which takes
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
more time and then the issue was
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
um to staff at a level where we could
 
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.330 align:start position:0%
um to staff at a level where we could
um

01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
process applications in a timely fashion
 
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.530 align:start position:0%
process applications in a timely fashion
the

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
the other issue we run into is is that
 
01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:27.770 align:start position:0%
the other issue we run into is is that
our

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
um as representative Weiler pointed out
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
our non-game species program which
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
includes threatened endangered species
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh is basically runoff donations and we
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
you know we receive donations and then
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
we leverage that with Federal funding to
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
come back and run the program
 
01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.930 align:start position:0%
come back and run the program
so

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
you would be asking you know people to
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
make donations in order to protect these
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
species from developers in the state of
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are limited is by rsas
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
as far as what we can move in from Fish
 
01:15:01.689 --> 01:15:01.699 align:start position:0%
and Game funds to work on tne species
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
very good
 
01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:06.890 align:start position:0%
very good
um

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
how healthy is the uh animal population
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
in the state I mean we you know in
 
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
I know we it seems so we got more
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
incursions of bears I I don't know if
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
I you know I I I know my area we got uh
 
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
we got some Wiley uh yogis out there
 
01:15:24.659 --> 01:15:26.030 align:start position:0%
we got some Wiley uh yogis out there
well

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
um we're coming off some really good
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
Seasons we had an excellent deer season
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
this year we had an excellent um bear
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
season this year I would say both
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
populations are doing very well
 
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I think especially with the deer
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
population it's not just the numbers
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's the quality of the deer that are
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
growing right now we have a very I think
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
we have some of the best deer we've ever
 
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
had in the state of New Hampshire right
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
now really
 
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:47.810 align:start position:0%
now really
um

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
um Colonel Jordan showed me some pitches
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
on an animal that he confiscated and I
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
would dare say it's probably the nicest
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
looking Buck I've ever seen shot in the
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.430 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
um

01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it was 15 points oh wow and how old
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
was he Kevin yeah 12 8 or 12. yeah I
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
think it was I think it was 12. I think
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
it happened to be one of our biologists
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
was at the check-in station and looked
 
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
at the deer so we actually uh and then
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
but he didn't pull a tooth but he pulled
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
a tooth after we confiscated it I think
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
he was 12 years old but he's a beautiful
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
beautiful deer so we've had some you
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
know that you know those areas are good
 
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh moose population uh we have two
 
01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
issues with our moose population up
 
01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.830 align:start position:0%
issues with our moose population up
north

01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
north
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
um The Tick issue and then in the
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state it's the
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
brain worm here the brain worm is that
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
CRS uh no uh CW or CW yeah chronic
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
wasting disease right now that's a
 
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
disease in white-tailed deer right now
 
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
is that I know it's migrating across the
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
country it is definitely spreading um
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
the closest it's come to us it was in
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
Quebec one of the issues that comes in
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
with CWD and it's not the only way do
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
not misunderstand me but
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
um what happened in Quebec uh they had a
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
Hunt Club up there where they were
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
bringing in Farm Deer to augment the
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
population and unfortunately one of them
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
had CWD
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I believe I can't I don't know the
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
details but I'm pretty sure that deer
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
escaped and the Quebec government
 
01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.270 align:start position:0%
escaped and the Quebec government
um

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
try to extinguish the deer population
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
locally and so far they've been very
 
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.870 align:start position:0%
locally and so far they've been very
successful

01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and they haven't found any CWD uh in
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
any of the wild deer up there New York
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
state had a case of it same thing they
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
were able to control it
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
um it's very hard to control and these
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
are the only two times any State's been
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
able to control it
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
um so the the threat comes from either
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
importing you know Farm Deer into the
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
into the state uh Hunter going out west
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
and bringing back you know uncured
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
antlers uncured
 
01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.649 align:start position:0%
antlers uncured
um

01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
bones I think yeah
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
um it's a pyron disease so it's very
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
similar to Scrapy and sheep or mad cow
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
and cows so so humans can
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh no it's enough different so there's
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
only there's very few cases of it in
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
human beings there is some thought that
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
some indigenous species
 
01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:17.659 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sorry
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
indigenous people
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
um that have a high venison intake have
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
have contracted it
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and they're doing some research in
 
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
that area but by and large humans don't
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
scrapeys and sheep do not transfer to
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
humans mad cow Ken
 
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
um they're all closely related and I
 
01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
um they're all closely related and I
apologize

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.250 align:start position:0%
apologize
um

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
I I can't remember the name of the
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
disease in humans but there is a disease
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's Prime based in humans is very
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
closely related to all of these is that
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
one of the duties of biologists to keep
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
track of all this uh we do
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
um this year we have had
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh three new Wildlife diseases in the
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
um I should I apologize two new diseases
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the wildlife in New Hampshire one of
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
course is even influenza that you read
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
about we first discovered that in wild
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
ducks that has since gotten into some
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
domestic poultry operation poultry
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
backyard poultry operations in New
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire none of our commercial Farms
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
have gotten it yet
 
01:19:19.199 --> 01:19:20.270 align:start position:0%
have gotten it yet
um

01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
but Nationwide there's been millions and
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of domestic birds
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
that have uh had to be put down because
 
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
of this it's one of the reasons why
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
you're now paying seven dollars a dozen
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
for eggs in a grocery store
 
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
um also a reason why y'all paid a little
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
extra for your turkeys this year too
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
turkey seem to have at it we had a
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
problem with it in geese most geese and
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
Ducks are where we've had it we've had a
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
large death on Geese
 
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
um Kevin what was the one in the deer
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I apologize
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
um but we had a new one that was I think
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
Webster right yes three three deer were
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
confirmed with it it's not
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
um terribly contagious that we're not
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
terribly concerned about it it's
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
probably been here for years we just
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
hadn't picked it up and then
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
um we're still in the process of testing
 
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
but uh our second year test came through
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
with with no positives but it's we're
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
pretty certain that we probably would
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
have we could find covet in our
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
whitetail deer population
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
right Whitetail Deer uh have had covet
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
there has only been one case where they
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
thought maybe a person caught covered
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
from a whitetail deer it's very hard to
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
get the transition back from the deer to
 
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.850 align:start position:0%
get the transition back from the deer to
us

01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
and one final question uh
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
our wild boar population and uh
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
I I know I believe it's illegal to hunt
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
I believe they're because they came from
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
Corbin Park
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're they're kind of
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
protected but I know in the past they
 
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
were hunted and yeah and you know they
 
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
were considered but now they're
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
considered protected well they're
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
considered private property
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh the property of the Corbin state park
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
because what's different with our wild
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
wild boar here in New Hampshire versus
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
other states is
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
um you know quite often what you're
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with in most other states are
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
feral Hogs Hogs that have gotten loose
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
and constantly reproduced
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
um what goes on here is some wild boar
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
that occasionally escaped from the park
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot out there though I mean at
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
Newport and that area is yes I believe
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
I've actually hunted them in Newport I
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
have a friend that Farms there and he's
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
invited me to his farm before
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
hmm yeah I know one person that got
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
quite a few uh I think at least 10 or 11
 
01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:46.580 align:start position:0%
and they're they're quite the animal
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
very different than deer you know you
 
01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:50.219 align:start position:0%
jump a deer you can pick them back up
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
again in a very short period of time but
 
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
bore they take off for the next County
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
they don't stop I mean they're they're
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
quite a rototiller yes they are
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
unbelievable what they how much damage
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh so you I mean is it is it much of an
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
expense to uh since we're here in
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
finance we should that's what probably
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
we should be talking about the expense
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
to uh or or we just don't do anything I
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
mean do you have much contact uh
 
01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
you know in the in the area we no we
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
it won't
 
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's not it's it's nowhere near as
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
widespread you you get in the areas like
 
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and places you know Texas or
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
to Florida and places like that it's a
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
whole I mean that's a real issue for us
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's not there are some impacts
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
locally for for a few Farmers very close
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
to the park but other than that it's not
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a Statewide issue and it's
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't seem to be spreading very
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
very well very good thank you anyway
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
um representative Heath I never
 
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
represented all right
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
well my question goes back to the ask
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
that you have for the Gopher I I don't
 
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
think I quite fully understood it and I
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
know Mickey I think he wanted to say
 
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.910 align:start position:0%
know Mickey I think he wanted to say
something

01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
so so what I think is happening is
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
the department currently has this
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
funding available and it's authorized
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
through June 30. a custom area with any
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
except an expend item that would go to
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee for instance
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
that money actually will go through
 
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:20.780 align:start position:0%
December they're allowed to spend that
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
so they would have to come back to
 
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
fiscal and get a retroactive item back
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
to July 1st to spend for the first half
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
of fiscal 24 or you could budget the
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
federal funds in-house Bill one but if
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
you didn't want to do that they'd come
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
to fiscal but what the department is
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
saying for the second half of fiscal 24
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
so January through June that's where
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
they have a shortfall of continuing
 
01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:46.100 align:start position:0%
oh 25 I'm sorry
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
the last six months of the biennium
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's a shortfall to complete to fund
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
those positions that the federal funds
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
would not cover so that's the request of
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you again on the fund balance in
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know 22 there's the 11 million which
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know you had a good balance
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
um you spent that down 23
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
um it's down again what I'm seeing is
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
your budgeted estimated revenue is
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent uh the the
 
01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.630 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent uh the the
Appropriations

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
um are fairly consistent so you've been
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
nipping into the fund balance for the
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
past three four years
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions yeah you know
 
01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.149 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions yeah you know
um

01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
yeah and so where did the fund balance
 
01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
why you know uh
 
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
where did the 11 million back in 22 come
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
from why was there such a healthy
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
balance then and what is going on either
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
on the revenue side or the appropriation
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
side that you have to nip into the
 
01:24:56.169 --> 01:24:56.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
could you come up to the mic no just
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
come on up to the mic and the director
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
can answer that if he wants to I'm sorry
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
I don't want to okay
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's two answers to that
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
actually we have a very healthy balance
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
in the fish and game fund right now for
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
a couple of different reasons in fiscal
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
year 20 and 21 it was brought up here
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we brought in quite a good healthy
 
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
amount of licenses and that added to our
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues absolutely
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
um eleven and a half million a year and
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
now we're kind of in the downward we
 
01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
also had a very good lapse at the end of
 
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:38.420 align:start position:0%
both of those fiscal years
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
this um this is kind of an internal
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement that I do which of
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
course does not
 
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
add a lapse in which historically we
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
have an eight to a ten percent lapse per
 
01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.169 align:start position:0%
have an eight to a ten percent lapse per
year

01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
so you could add that lapse in as well
 
01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:03.050 align:start position:0%
so you could add that lapse in as well
and

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
can I interrupt ask a question you keep
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
your laps then the laps or oh absolutely
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
we are self-funded we are the face thank
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:16.850 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
our beginning balance is actually the
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
highest balance that the fish and game
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
fund has ever had
 
01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:28.129 align:start position:0%
fund has ever had
historically

01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
Mick you want to say something I was
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
just going to point the committee to
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
page 31 of your executive summary from
 
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget you'll
 
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
see the governor's Surplus statement in
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
there uh I have identified something in
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
there that I would need to ask the
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
governor's office about because it does
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
talk about a general fund transfer into
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
the fish and game fund which I don't
 
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
believe is actually
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
happening you've got General funds in
 
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
your operating budget corrected it's not
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
a transfer to the general fund so we'll
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
talk about that but you will see that
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
there is over fiscal 23 24 and 25 about
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
4.2 million dollars of laps estimate
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
that on Kathy's sheet here is not
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
reflected it's not reflected so that's
 
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
when she's talking about the laps you'll
 
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
see the governor's estimate for the laps
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
oh representative thank you
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
so can cats give give us give us a list
 
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.310 align:start position:0%
so can cats give give us give us a list
of

01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:24.780 align:start position:0%
um general fund items that that you're
 
01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.930 align:start position:0%
um general fund items that that you're
requesting

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:29.780 align:start position:0%
we're not requesting specific General
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
funded items that I am aware of
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the general funds are all reflected
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
within one accounting unit and that is
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
conservation law enforcement
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
I don't have my glasses on director
 
01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.550 align:start position:0%
I don't have my glasses on director
sorry

01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
oh that's in here
 
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't make it really I
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
didn't mean for you to have to go
 
01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:28.340 align:start position:0%
searching for this side
 
01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.139 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of scribbled searching for the
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
glasses you know what I'm I'm scribbling
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
down here and I was just wanted you to
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
um confirm that what I had here right we
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
asked for 139 000 today we've asked for
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
an additional 139 000 for the aot
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
program Kevin 170 171 for the two CEOs
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
each year each year so that's in
 
01:28:55.810 --> 01:28:55.820 align:start position:0%
addition to what's already in yeah
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
7887. so can I can I follow up with you
 
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
would I scribble down here was on on the
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
20 uh 24
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 996
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
000 fiscal 25 1.4 million
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.169 --> 01:29:20.179 align:start position:0%
000 plus
 
01:29:24.729 --> 01:29:24.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
171 is times two yeah 171 extra for 24
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
and in 25 and then in 25 we need an
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
additional 139 000 for the 802.
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
okay sure well okay yeah
 
01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:42.620 align:start position:0%
no I I have I have these numbers yeah
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
scribbled down here but
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
you know I can't read my own
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
no we we do show the above figures on
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
page 600. the 996 000 and the 1.49 in
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
the in the governor's budget these are
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to that correct sir so and
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual to for us to put
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
General funds in fish and game we were
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of that before you had your
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
good years yeah so it you know it's
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
we've got to keep this this uh agency
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
healthy whatever it takes and you know
 
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:21.830 align:start position:0%
healthy whatever it takes and you know
the

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's Ebbs and flows in the in the
 
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
demand but nevertheless
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
they still got to have the staff keep
 
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
busy and you know and we got involved
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
and are asked to do a lot of things that
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
are not Sportsman related
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if anybody keeps in a
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
keeps an aquarium but there's and don't
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
ask me I don't I really understand but
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
there's something called a moss ball
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
that you can go to an aquarium store and
 
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.149 align:start position:0%
that you can go to an aquarium store and
buy

01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
buy
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
and it's a living plant well
 
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunately whoever creates these Moss
 
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
balls had water that was contaminated
 
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
with zebra mussels
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
so now all of a sudden you have Moss
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
ball and a baby zebra muscle you can't
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
see without a microscope so you as a
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
customer you would come in and buy that
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
you could buy that Moss ball and not
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
know it and then put it in your tank and
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
then when next time you go clean your
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
tank and dump it down in the drain
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
if you live with city city sewer you now
 
01:31:21.169 --> 01:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
just contaminated your your Municipal
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
sewer system with with zebra mussels so
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
it actually fell on fishing game
 
01:31:27.239 --> 01:31:28.189 align:start position:0%
it actually fell on fishing game
um

01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire things are a little
 
01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
different you know we don't necessarily
 
01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:33.380 align:start position:0%
have large amounts of money in large
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
staff all the time so the Department of
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
Agriculture regulates and inspects
 
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
Agriculture regulates and inspects
um

01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh pet stores
 
01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
so we worked you know we teamed up with
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
Department of AG they were able to tell
 
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
us who had aquarium equipment and who
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
didn't and then we sent out our CEOs
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
because the department of AG didn't have
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
the authority to talk to them about it
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
we had to go out and talk to him about
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
it and we gathered up Moss balls and
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully kept kept zebra mussels out
 
01:32:05.689 --> 01:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
it's a small example but this is what
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
happens to fish and game and at the end
 
01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
of the day if you bought a hunting
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
license or a fishing license you know
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
municipality should be thanking you
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
because you just help protect their
 
01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
sewer systems from Super muscles
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
but that's what happens
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler there was another
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
example I remember that I was surprised
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh people in on Great Bay that have
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
waterfront property
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
will come in and ask to have a an oyster
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
bed approved yeah and at one point we
 
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
cut down some funding on Environmental
 
01:32:37.739 --> 01:32:39.470 align:start position:0%
cut down some funding on Environmental
Services

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
and they suddenly decided they weren't
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
going to do a water quality check which
 
01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
they were required before the fish and
 
01:32:47.689 --> 01:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
game could issue this permit
 
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
and they said no
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
they cut us they cut us some money so
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do that anymore
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
we had to go back to them and said read
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
the law you will go and check you know
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
but it was just a way to try to get you
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
on their side to say you better get give
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
more money to environmental services
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we won't be able to put out these
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
permits so if we have little games
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
played sometimes by some of these
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
agencies that try to involve somebody
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
else and I was surprised they they
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
pulled that but we headed It Off by and
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
large I would dare say New Hampshire I
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
think our different agencies are willing
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
to work together we were talking about
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
those animal diseases with AI so you had
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
USDA Animal Control you had New
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game you had New
 
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of AG New Hampshire
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire Diagnostic
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
lab and all five groups were able to you
 
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
know pitch together and and do our
 
01:33:42.729 --> 01:33:42.739 align:start position:0%
individual tasks and I think
 
01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's not like you could say we're
 
01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
successful or unsuccessful but we were
 
01:33:48.169 --> 01:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to cooperate and work
 
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
together for the good of the public and
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's something to be very
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh popovichi Miller
 
01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and again I apologize for
 
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
being out and missing a good part I will
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
watch it on tape and catch up
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
um so if any of those questions have
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
been already asked obviously just tell
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
me so and I'll watch the tape on it but
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
I had some notes on various uh budget
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
Pages starting with uh you know page 560
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
14-hour budget line zero two seven
 
01:34:28.689 --> 01:34:28.699 align:start position:0%
560 what sir
 
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
564 is the page and the the code is um
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
zero two seven which is where is it
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
transfers to oit
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
my question is you are mentioning the
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
transfer Studio office and information
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
technology you are mentioning that you
 
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
have database upgrades and projects so I
 
01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
kind of understand you know the reason
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
why they're increasing but I just wanted
 
01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
to check whether that was a temporary or
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
a permanent Trend I'm assuming you know
 
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
part of it is Project I well I
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
um not to be derogatory to my good
 
01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
friends at doit but it does seem like
 
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're but their bill keeps going up
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
all the time uh I do understand that
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
they have a horrendous job of protecting
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
um uh computer systems from hackers and
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
whatnot so I I don't necessarily
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
begrudge what we pay but at the same
 
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
time it is going up and it is hard for
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
those agencies that are self-funded it
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
becomes you know harder and harder for
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
us to pay those bills as time goes on
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
the database work we're doing with them
 
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
is actually a gopher project and not
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
part of that budget but in that budget
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
is we did agree or requested a half a
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
part-time we're splitting a I.T lead uh
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
with the veterans hospital is what the
 
01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
goal is and that I believe that is in in
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
that added request according to James
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
Greer at the budget at the governor's
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
office okay I may send an email and ask
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
for more detail because it's an increase
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
of like 240 and uh just want to better
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
understand where that's part of it is
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
that is is a is half of a employee
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
understood yeah and then other and the
 
01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
rest of it is just they're increasing
 
01:36:11.219 --> 01:36:12.350 align:start position:0%
rest of it is just they're increasing
costs

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
got it and then a lot page five six
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
eight line is zero six four there is a
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
significant increase in benefits it's
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
like the two-thirds down the page five
 
01:36:25.129 --> 01:36:25.139 align:start position:0%
six eight
 
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
um if you look in 22 the uh retirement
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
pension benefits health insurance goes
 
01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:34.940 align:start position:0%
from 578 to 911 and then to
 
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
798 and then to 886
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
if I could just color on it that's a
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency we pay the cost of
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
our retirees health insurance and that
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
is what that line is
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
okay so it's based on who signed up for
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
what plans and the projections on who's
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
going to be what correct that number is
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
provided to us by uh the department of
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
administrative services and that is
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
based on their projected cost for our
 
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
retirees great got it page 571 line 30.
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
the equipment new replacement
 
01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:12.830 align:start position:0%
the equipment new replacement
um

01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's again a pretty big spike in 23
 
01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
and then stays at higher levels in 24
 
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
and 25.
 
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's at the top of page 571.
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
23 is what we're currently budgeted 22
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we were budgeted the same
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
amount at a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we did not spend it
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
because people did not put in their
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
requisitions for a new vehicle because
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
we can't find them really you're saying
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
there was a disruption some disruption
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
in the markets we just received a
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle for our hunter education program
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
that we had a purchase order for for 23
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
months now I know I know I've been on
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
the downside and we've had similar
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
issues even with Cruisers and everything
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
else it's a nightmare for 24 and 25 that
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
figure was based on during our uh senior
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
leadership discussions individual
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
division Chiefs putting in their request
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
for vehicle needs this Fleet Management
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
account is an overall Department Fleet
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
Management account and it was individual
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
requests for division for replay
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
replacement vehicles I understood what
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
would you say that is a average Baseline
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
obviously this tends to be noisy because
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes you buy vehicles that are ears
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
when you don't need them so it's really
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
hard to flatten it but what would you
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
think is a baseline are we at uh 250 and
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
200 above the Baseline briefly because
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to catch up for vehicles we
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't replace during covid
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
well this Fleet Management is for
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles outside of law enforcement
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
right okay law enforcement all the other
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
departments they're in a different
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
replacement and uh it has nothing to do
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
with covid really it's quite frankly
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
because we did not have funding to
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
replace vehicles for such a long period
 
01:39:10.689 --> 01:39:10.699 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
we have really overspent on fixing
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
Vehicles no longer fixable no and it's
 
01:39:22.090 --> 01:39:22.100 align:start position:0%
not the wise use of resources
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it's very inefficient that's that's
 
01:39:27.850 --> 01:39:27.860 align:start position:0%
great I appreciate it uh then on line
 
01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:33.330 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:35.330 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's again a pretty big increase between
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
the current levels and the budgeted
 
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
levels I'm just trying to understand
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
again the
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
need for it game management is one of
 
01:39:55.129 --> 01:39:55.139 align:start position:0%
our dedicated accounts and
 
01:39:55.139 --> 01:39:55.790 align:start position:0%
our dedicated accounts and
um

01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
the best person to answer this would be
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
Dan Bergeron who was the chief of
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
wildlife but it is my understanding that
 
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
this would be used for contracts for
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:16.460 align:start position:0%
ow um
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
for additional detail to be mailed to
 
01:40:20.209 --> 01:40:20.219 align:start position:0%
the committee that would be much
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
appreciated I certainly will do that
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and let's see next we are a
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
page 581 line033
 
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh third down the page land Acquisitions
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
and easement
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
that one is again a bit spiky and I'm
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand what's going
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
on so it's going from 260 to 500 and
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
then it is budgeted at 350. just some
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is another dedicated account and
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
our apportionments for PR funds has been
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
Pittman Robinson funds has steadily been
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
increased on the federal level and to
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that we try to ensure
 
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
that we have enough money appropriated
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the budget should the opportunity to
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
be able to purchase a good piece of land
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
Avail itself
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
um not always is that opportunity there
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
land acquisition is unpredictable by
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
Nature sometimes you think you're gonna
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
close and the day of the close turns out
 
01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
you don't yeah that's correct but
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
basically the intent of those funds is
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
to also get matching funds from the feds
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
so it's a way to leverage our dollar and
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully get some more absolutely as a
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
matter of fact if you look down at the
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
funding component especially in fiscal
 
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
year to uh in in all the fiscal years if
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
you look down at the funding component
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
the increase is in the federal funds
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah and actually the federal funds
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
Trend now that you point to it tends to
 
01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
mirror the trend in our budget it's so I
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
can see the correlation there
 
01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:02.570 align:start position:0%
can see the correlation there
great

01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:03.530 align:start position:0%
great
um

01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
let's see go ahead it's actually a
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
little different as far as the federal
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
funds on this particular item Federal
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
money comes from the excise tax on the
 
01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:19.100 align:start position:0%
sale of guns ammunition and hunting
 
01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
equipment so if folks have been reading
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
the newspapers or participating you know
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
that gun and ammunition sales have been
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
going up steadily over the last few
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
years so we're actually receiving we're
 
01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:34.580 align:start position:0%
actually eligible for more Federal money
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
in the last few years it's gone up
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
fairly dramatically
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
um now the normal match is a 25-75 match
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
but we can do other things to come up
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
with our 25 match like if we have a
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
piece of land that does not have already
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
have a federal incumbency accumbens on
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
it we can use that land and put a
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
federal you know put the federal lien on
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
it and then and then we can use that as
 
01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
part of our match so sometimes it's not
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily just a cash that we do but
 
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
that does play out you know there's a
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
lot of ups and downs in this the other
 
01:43:09.649 --> 01:43:09.659 align:start position:0%
thing we can do is work with another
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
partner and and use their cash for match
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve some of these land
 
01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
purchases fully understood and I'm even
 
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
gonna refrain from harping on how
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
certain sales are good for the economy
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
on the same page line 304 deals with
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
research and management again a similar
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
in this particular unit the wildlife
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
habitat Wildlife program
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
same type of situation with UNH and the
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
research and it's the same type of
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
situation where there is a desire to
 
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
grow the habitat program
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
I I would again I would appreciate some
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
feed follow-up later on exactly what's
 
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
the nature of the program and how it
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
benefits us absolutely and I apologize
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
for asking so many questions but you
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
know it's my first term and I have a lot
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
to learn about every agency and I really
 
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate you providing all this one of
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
the things is Our Land base increases
 
01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:12.179 align:start position:0%
the costs of maintaining that land base
 
01:44:14.689 --> 01:44:14.699 align:start position:0%
obviously is going up so we are spending
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
more money on on those issues some of
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
the issues are just keeping roads
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
repaired and whatnot we also manage the
 
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
land for hat wildlife habitat so we're
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
in doing uh forestry cuts and works like
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
that and then we also end up having to
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
spend money on defending uh property
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
just like any landowner property
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
boundaries Etc markings you know signing
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
and signage and whatnot cool so if we
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
could go to page 589 just two more this
 
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
is two more questions five or page 589
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
line 103. is that the um
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
trailers Bureau New transfer that you
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
were talking about the increase transfer
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
or no that is not that is actually uh
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
the line for contracts oh sorry I
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
I must have gotten you the wrong number
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
zero four nine I just wrote the wrong
 
01:45:09.119 --> 01:45:10.910 align:start position:0%
zero four nine I just wrote the wrong
line

01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
is the increase in transfers to the
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
trails Bureau I thought so but again you
 
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
know I'd rather double check I don't
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
want to assign two millions to the wrong
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
reason and the last question on page 597
 
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
line 307 about the Statewide Public boat
 
01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.310 align:start position:0%
line 307 about the Statewide Public boat
access

01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
at two-thirds down the page
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's again if you look at the expense
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know 800 000 in the previous
 
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
year 100 now and then evens out to 400
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
any color as to why the swings uh are
 
01:45:43.739 --> 01:45:45.709 align:start position:0%
any color as to why the swings uh are
happening

01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 was a major project
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
called downing's Landing up on Lake
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee that's why that very large
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
expanse and you can also see the
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
corresponding federal funds for that
 
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if Garrett is
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
anticipating some big projects yeah
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so the two aspects of this program
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
one is the maintenance on our boat
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
Landings and that would be obviously
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
kind of steady or hopefully more steady
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
obviously sometimes winter damage or
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
storm damage does create or or even
 
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
erosion or sediment deposits create some
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
extra management for us
 
01:46:31.609 --> 01:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
um beyond that is when we're actually
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
building a new boat landing in a new
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
location so uh downing's Landing was on
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
a very southern tip of Alton Bay
 
01:46:42.649 --> 01:46:42.659 align:start position:0%
um and we were very fortunate a few
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
years back to be able to buy that piece
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
of property and they had been working on
 
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
it and we finished up that project uh
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
in that fiscal year
 
01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
um this year he's got two uh uh Garrett
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
is our boat landing guy and he's got two
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
uh projects that he is looking at doing
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
over the next couple fiscal year of the
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
next two fiscal years that he's he's
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do one
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
um is a project on the Connecticut River
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
I think in Claremont but I'm not 100
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure and then he's got another one down
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
in Raymond he's looking at God knows
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
Claremont can use some help you know
 
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
here and there
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I used to be at Dartmouth College and
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is a wonderful paragliding
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
facility in Claremont but that's really
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
my entire experience with the area so I
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you taking all the
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
time and again I apologize for just
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
having a long batch of questions lined
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
up but I had to step out and I
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Kathy before she
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
before she sits down
 
01:47:50.639 --> 01:47:53.870 align:start position:0%
before she sits down
um

01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:55.850 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
how much additional funding does the
 
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
department need in above above the
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
really confer
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
to this meeting about that
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
well so so the extra money would be
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
those that we already went over for
 
01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
General funding and then Kathy's
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
position would be extra funding and I
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't have that figure but that would be
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
coming out of the fish and game fund
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's approximate at least sixty five
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in each year of the by
 
01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.209 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in each year of the by
any

01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.219 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
I just want authority to to create that
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.930 --> 01:49:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:29.150 --> 02:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:29.160 --> 03:00:22.969 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:00:22.969 --> 03:00:22.979 align:start position:0%

I don't have a gavel but
 
03:00:57.889 --> 03:00:57.899 align:start position:0%

of safety and proud of how each division
 
03:01:56.750 --> 03:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
works day in and day out to ensure that
 
03:01:58.490 --> 03:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
Public Safety Services are delivered
 
03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
across the state demand for Public
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
Safety Services continues to increase
 
03:02:05.809 --> 03:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit increases combined
 
03:02:07.969 --> 03:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
with equipment replacement costs and
 
03:02:10.969 --> 03:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
growing Reliance on I.T infrastructure
 
03:02:13.670 --> 03:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
and systems have contributed to an
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
overall increase in providing the same
 
03:02:18.769 --> 03:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
level of these critical services
 
03:02:20.690 --> 03:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
throughout the presentation today we
 
03:02:23.450 --> 03:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
will focus how remaining prioritized
 
03:02:25.490 --> 03:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
needs will impact delivery of Public
 
03:02:27.950 --> 03:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
Safety Services across New Hampshire we
 
03:02:29.690 --> 03:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
recognize that state funds are limited
 
03:02:31.490 --> 03:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
and respectfully requests your
 
03:02:33.170 --> 03:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
consideration be given to those items
 
03:02:35.210 --> 03:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
during the house phase of the budget
 
03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
process director Lavoy will now spend
 
03:02:39.230 --> 03:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
time discussing the governor's budget
 
03:02:41.389 --> 03:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
request at the division level and
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
provide a summary of changes current
 
03:02:46.610 --> 03:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
funding gaps and any expected impacts on
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
Services we're happy to take any
 
03:02:49.730 --> 03:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have throughout
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
the presentation thank you and thank you
 
03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:53.150 align:start position:0%
the presentation thank you and thank you
Steve

03:02:53.150 --> 03:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
Steve
 
03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you commissioner good
 
03:02:56.690 --> 03:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody so we've got a
 
03:02:58.370 --> 03:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
presentation that you've got a copy of
 
03:02:59.630 --> 03:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
here in front of you and what we tried
 
03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
to do here is really summarize our
 
03:03:03.349 --> 03:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
budget I mean there's so many pages in
 
03:03:05.389 --> 03:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
that document to pull it together and
 
03:03:07.190 --> 03:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
highlight the major changes in the major
 
03:03:09.650 --> 03:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
areas that you're seeing so on page two
 
03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder from the last time
 
03:03:15.410 --> 03:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
that we met we're structured into seven
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department of
 
03:03:19.010 --> 03:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
safety each of these divisions has a
 
03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
unique funding mix and funding source
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
and so because of that it really makes
 
03:03:24.349 --> 03:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
sense for us to kind of consider the
 
03:03:26.090 --> 03:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
needs at the division level instead of
 
03:03:28.610 --> 03:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
department-wide and so the seven bureaus
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
are I'm sorry seven divisions are listed
 
03:03:33.950 --> 03:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
there and their primary responsibilities
 
03:03:37.010 --> 03:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
on page three we do start with a summary
 
03:03:39.230 --> 03:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
for the Department as a whole so this is
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
extremely high level and we'll go into
 
03:03:42.769 --> 03:03:42.779 align:start position:0%
more detail by division in the following
 
03:03:47.410 --> 03:03:47.420 align:start position:0%
pages but the 24-25 request so in 2024
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
the department of safety budget is
 
03:03:54.309 --> 03:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
249.3 million dollars and in 25 it's
 
03:03:57.170 --> 03:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
250.5 million dollars that is an
 
03:04:01.250 --> 03:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
increase from FY 23 of about 15 in total
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
you can see the different fund mixes
 
03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are provided there look at the
 
03:04:08.830 --> 03:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
green are the general funds so in FY 24
 
03:04:12.349 --> 03:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
there's 53.9 million in general funds in
 
03:04:16.010 --> 03:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
an fy25 55.6 million there's all the
 
03:04:17.870 --> 03:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
other funding sources summarized below
 
03:04:19.969 --> 03:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
as well Highway funds cost of
 
03:04:21.650 --> 03:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
collections which are the revenues that
 
03:04:23.389 --> 03:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
we collect at the DMV and the road toll
 
03:04:25.330 --> 03:04:25.340 align:start position:0%
before they hit the highway fund
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds that support some of our
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
state police operations and then several
 
03:04:31.490 --> 03:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that fall into the other
 
03:04:33.590 --> 03:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
source those dedicated funds we look at
 
03:04:35.269 --> 03:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue projections and make sure that
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
we have the funding available to to meet
 
03:04:38.690 --> 03:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
those appropriation requests that we
 
03:04:40.849 --> 03:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
have in the budget and then finally we
 
03:04:42.650 --> 03:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
have federal funds as well and a lot of
 
03:04:44.690 --> 03:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that we receive are
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
passed through to other state agencies
 
03:04:49.010 --> 03:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
and other local entities but there are
 
03:04:51.050 --> 03:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
some that support our operations as well
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
especially in Homeland Security
 
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
authorized full-time positions to the
 
03:04:57.550 --> 03:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
right here we have
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
1143 classified and 13 unclassified
 
03:05:03.889 --> 03:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
positions there are 34 unfunded
 
03:05:07.250 --> 03:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
full-time positions uh within this at
 
03:05:09.650 --> 03:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
this time and some of those include new
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
positions that we requested through the
 
03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
agency phase um so we'll discuss those
 
03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh with you as we go through the
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
presentation today
 
03:05:19.490 --> 03:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
as far as significant changes for 24 and
 
03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:20.889 align:start position:0%
as far as significant changes for 24 and
25

03:05:20.889 --> 03:05:20.899 align:start position:0%
25
 
03:05:24.769 --> 03:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
12.1 million of the increase from 23 and
 
03:05:27.769 --> 03:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
9.1 million in 25 is due to operating
 
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
costs that have increased including
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
replacement equipment supplies
 
03:05:34.429 --> 03:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
facilities contracts we've just seen
 
03:05:36.889 --> 03:05:36.899 align:start position:0%
prices go up across the board there's
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
also some increased volume of activity
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we need equipment we need to
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
replace because we weren't able to in
 
03:05:45.410 --> 03:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
previous biennium because of supply
 
03:05:47.150 --> 03:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
chain shortages and because of funding
 
03:05:49.010 --> 03:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
constraints so there's some opportunity
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
for us to gain ground and make sure that
 
03:05:52.490 --> 03:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
we don't run into future problems with
 
03:05:54.590 --> 03:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
our equipment replacement plans
 
03:05:57.650 --> 03:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
8.9 million of the increase in 24 and
 
03:06:00.170 --> 03:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
8.3 million of the increase in 25 are
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
due to increases in federal funds the
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
majority of those are disaster Grant
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursements the state and local
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
agencies so like I said pass-through
 
03:06:11.170 --> 03:06:11.180 align:start position:0%
funds in two other areas
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
5.7 million of the increase in 24 and
 
03:06:16.849 --> 03:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
6.7 and 25 are due to change in
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
budgeting uh required by administrative
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
services this resulted in double
 
03:06:23.809 --> 03:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
budgeting risk and benefit costs so that
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're recorded within the divisions
 
03:06:27.410 --> 03:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
and those funding sources where we're
 
03:06:29.690 --> 03:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
going to pay for those out of but we
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
have a single accounting unit where the
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
actual expenditures out to das are also
 
03:06:35.929 --> 03:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
reflected so it's not truly an increase
 
03:06:38.510 --> 03:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's just the way that we're accounting
 
03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
for this this biennium
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and finally 3.9 million of the increase
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 are due to increases in
 
03:06:49.969 --> 03:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
doit costs these are a major I.T systems
 
03:06:51.769 --> 03:06:51.779 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner mentioned
 
03:06:54.290 --> 03:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
investments in I.T are critical and they
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
continue and that's the increased costs
 
03:06:59.630 --> 03:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
are are being driven up we also have
 
03:07:01.790 --> 03:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
shared doit services that have increased
 
03:07:03.290 --> 03:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
as well and those are recorded in here
 
03:07:05.410 --> 03:07:05.420 align:start position:0%
and part of that
 
03:07:08.090 --> 03:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
so in total General Highway Turnpike
 
03:07:10.250 --> 03:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
cost of collections funding so what we
 
03:07:12.290 --> 03:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
kind of call the state funding section
 
03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
increased by 9.2 million or seven
 
03:07:18.170 --> 03:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
percent in FY 24 and 3.1 million or two
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
percent in fy25 and that's as the
 
03:07:22.250 --> 03:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned that's providing
 
03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
the same level of service that's really
 
03:07:25.910 --> 03:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
what this budget's built around
 
03:07:28.910 --> 03:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
other funding sources increased by 10.1
 
03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
million and 24 which is 17 and that was
 
03:07:34.130 --> 03:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
due to a change in accounting as we
 
03:07:35.809 --> 03:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned before and the overall Rising
 
03:07:38.290 --> 03:07:38.300 align:start position:0%
costs and within this budget uh
 
03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
presentation we'll talk about eight
 
03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
civilian positions that are unfunded uh
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
and new nine new positions that are also
 
03:07:47.090 --> 03:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
unfunded that are required to meet
 
03:07:49.490 --> 03:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
increased demands for service that the
 
03:07:50.630 --> 03:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
public have
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are 17 Trooper positions that are
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded within the governor's budget
 
03:07:58.250 --> 03:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
but these 17 positions were unfunded in
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the previous biennium and they were
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
unfunded in the biennium before that as
 
03:08:04.130 --> 03:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
well and so we want to make everyone
 
03:08:06.110 --> 03:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
aware that they're not funded
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
um but we would be funding current
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
levels of service if we wanted to expand
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
the levels of service we would need
 
03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:16.809 --> 03:08:16.819 align:start position:0%
so we'll move on to the division level
 
03:08:18.769 --> 03:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
starting with the office of the
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner on page four
 
03:08:22.730 --> 03:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner's budget
 
03:08:26.570 --> 03:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
request for fy24 is 20.1 million it's
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
actually a three percent decrease from
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
the FY 23 budget
 
03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
the decrease is due primarily to a
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
transfer of Debt Service expenditures
 
03:08:38.030 --> 03:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
that were recorded within this area but
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
we transfer those out into special
 
03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
expenses account because of challenges
 
03:08:43.969 --> 03:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
we had with the fund mixes within that
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
particular accounting unit
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner has 45
 
03:08:51.170 --> 03:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
classified and three unclassified
 
03:08:53.210 --> 03:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
full-time positions there are no
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions within within this
 
03:08:55.680 --> 03:08:56.929 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions within within this
unit

03:08:56.929 --> 03:08:56.939 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:08:59.389 --> 03:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
and the office of the commissioner is
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
provides oversight over some direct
 
03:09:03.050 --> 03:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
areas including the Bureau of hearings
 
03:09:07.309 --> 03:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
which conducted 14 343 hearings in FY 22
 
03:09:09.469 --> 03:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
the office of Highway Safety which
 
03:09:12.670 --> 03:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
Awards 886 thousand dollars in
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
additional support to 81 local police
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
departments that's for additional
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
patrols enhanced Patrols an illegal unit
 
03:09:22.490 --> 03:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
which provides legal services to all the
 
03:09:24.050 --> 03:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
divisions within the Department of
 
03:09:24.060 --> 03:09:26.269 align:start position:0%
divisions within the Department of
Safety

03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
so the significant changes we talked
 
03:09:29.630 --> 03:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
about the decrease no significant
 
03:09:32.269 --> 03:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
changes in salaries and benefits there
 
03:09:35.690 --> 03:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
is a slight increase of 340 K and 25 due
 
03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:36.429 align:start position:0%
is a slight increase of 340 K and 25 due
to

03:09:36.429 --> 03:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:09:39.530 --> 03:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
increases in the general services and
 
03:09:41.210 --> 03:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
risk benefit costs
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
and there's no prioritized needs as we
 
03:09:45.530 --> 03:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this area
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
moving on to page five the division of
 
03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:49.490 align:start position:0%
moving on to page five the division of
administration

03:09:49.490 --> 03:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
division of administration's budget
 
03:09:54.530 --> 03:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
request for FY 24 is 12.2 million this
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
is a four percent increase over 23.
 
03:10:00.290 --> 03:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
12.5 million and 25 which is a three
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
03:10:04.130 --> 03:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
there are 85 classified and two
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions uh within this
 
03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:08.210 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions uh within this
division

03:10:08.210 --> 03:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
there's one unfunded full-time position
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
but that's a new position that we're
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
requesting this year so all of our
 
03:10:16.730 --> 03:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
existing positions are fully funded
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
the division collected in FY 22 over 181
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars in road toll revenues
 
03:10:25.250 --> 03:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
they conducted 108 audits of road toll
 
03:10:28.130 --> 03:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
licensees processed over 1.8 million
 
03:10:30.650 --> 03:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
pieces of incoming mail and 1.3 million
 
03:10:32.929 --> 03:10:32.939 align:start position:0%
pieces of outgoing mail and distributed
 
03:10:36.170 --> 03:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
567 000 license plates and 1.8 million
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
plate decals to municipalities and DMV
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
substations across the state
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the division is uh
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
62 percent of the costs that you're
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
seeing here are related to Personnel
 
03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:49.610 align:start position:0%
seeing here are related to Personnel
um

03:10:49.610 --> 03:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:49.620 --> 03:10:51.349 align:start position:0%
um
in

03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:10:53.450 --> 03:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
the main changes we have on the summary
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
of significant changes in the division
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
of administration 162 000 of the
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
increase in 24 and 386 000 be increased
 
03:11:02.330 --> 03:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
in 25 are due to salary and benefit
 
03:11:04.610 --> 03:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
increases from increments
 
03:11:08.450 --> 03:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
260 000 of the increase in 24 and 272 of
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
the increase in 25 are due to the doit
 
03:11:12.710 --> 03:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
expenses that are increasing then those
 
03:11:14.330 --> 03:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
benefit the department as a whole and
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
many of those are recorded within this
 
03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:17.870 align:start position:0%
many of those are recorded within this
division

03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:11:19.550 --> 03:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
and then we also transferred three
 
03:11:21.769 --> 03:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
existing facilities positions from other
 
03:11:24.230 --> 03:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department into the
 
03:11:26.570 --> 03:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
facilities management Bureau to ensure
 
03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
effective oversight and consistent
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
delivery of services and so that's
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
reflected that change is reflected in
 
03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
this budget as well
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
there is one prioritized need that's
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
impacting this Division and that's the
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
request for a new human resource
 
03:11:41.570 --> 03:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
coordinator too to assist in the Human
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
Resources Bureau that Bureau is
 
03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for all the transactions
 
03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
employee pay benefits new hires
 
03:11:53.809 --> 03:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
also any any risk issues as far as ADA
 
03:11:53.819 --> 03:11:55.330 align:start position:0%
also any any risk issues as far as ADA
requirements

03:11:55.330 --> 03:11:55.340 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:11:59.090 --> 03:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
essentially the the the current
 
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
structure doesn't allow us to be timely
 
03:12:04.730 --> 03:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
with a lot of these requests this
 
03:12:06.230 --> 03:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
position would be required to ensure
 
03:12:08.469 --> 03:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
that we can turn those around timely
 
03:12:11.330 --> 03:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
and ensure that there's no errors we can
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
mitigate errors that might negatively
 
03:12:17.929 --> 03:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:20.090 --> 03:12:20.100 align:start position:0%

the Division of Motor Vehicles request
 
03:12:27.530 --> 03:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
for fy24 is 32.5 million dollars and for
 
03:12:31.130 --> 03:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
FY 25 is 33.1 million dollars that's
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
about a six percent increase from 23 for
 
03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:35.809 align:start position:0%
about a six percent increase from 23 for
24.

03:12:35.809 --> 03:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
24.
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
there are 208 classified and two
 
03:12:41.210 --> 03:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
unclassified full-time positions within
 
03:12:43.849 --> 03:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
the division there are six unfunded
 
03:12:46.730 --> 03:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
positions within the DMV
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
the service highlights for FY 22 the DMV
 
03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
issued 405 167 motor vehicle titles
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
formed 36 219 road tests produced 381

497 driver license and ID cards
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
processed over 1.6 million Motor Vehicle
 
03:13:08.090 --> 03:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
registrations and fielded 412 336
 
03:13:11.929 --> 03:13:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:14.750 --> 03:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
summary of significant changes for fy24
 
03:13:18.290 --> 03:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
2.5 million of the increase in 24 and
 
03:13:20.690 --> 03:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
2.7 of the increase in 25 are directly
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
related to doit costs for the
 
03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the vision and map
 
03:13:27.050 --> 03:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
systems those are the DMV subsystems
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
that all transactions are processed
 
03:13:30.650 --> 03:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
through and those need to be maintained
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they don't
 
03:13:32.279 --> 03:13:34.070 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they don't
um

03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
they don't go obsolete we need to make
 
03:13:38.269 --> 03:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
sure things are are always functioning
 
03:13:42.170 --> 03:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
1 million decrease in FY 24 and 379 000
 
03:13:44.570 --> 03:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
decrease in 25 are due to salary and
 
03:13:46.849 --> 03:13:46.859 align:start position:0%
benefit expenses there's four unfunded
 
03:13:48.410 --> 03:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
positions that are impacting the new
 
03:13:48.420 --> 03:13:50.570 align:start position:0%
positions that are impacting the new
employees

03:13:50.570 --> 03:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:13:54.170 --> 03:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
and 475 000 of the increase in contracts
 
03:13:56.450 --> 03:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
for operational Services due to costs
 
03:13:58.309 --> 03:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
associated with relocating the Epping
 
03:13:58.319 --> 03:13:59.630 align:start position:0%
associated with relocating the Epping
DMV

03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
DMV
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
um to a lease space so that's uh that
 
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
that is a new item within this budget
 
03:14:06.769 --> 03:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
the current uh Epping DMV is located in
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
the troop station in the building that
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
houses The Troop station in Epping as
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
well and that location around that area
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
has started to grow and it's been
 
03:14:16.250 --> 03:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
challenging to get
 
03:14:18.769 --> 03:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
um in and out of that of that parking
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
lot quite frankly and so driving exams
 
03:14:22.849 --> 03:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
getting people to
 
03:14:24.530 --> 03:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
um to get back out onto the road has
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
been a challenge and they've begun to
 
03:14:28.370 --> 03:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
outgrow the space too can't keep the
 
03:14:30.830 --> 03:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
customers in line the lines are getting
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
longer so one of the models at the DMV
 
03:14:35.090 --> 03:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
that we've been successful in is moving
 
03:14:38.090 --> 03:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
to lease space which allows them to grow
 
03:14:40.150 --> 03:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
and constrict as needed based on volume
 
03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
the most recent facility was Keen so
 
03:14:44.450 --> 03:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
Keane moved out of the troop station
 
03:14:46.090 --> 03:14:46.100 align:start position:0%
into lease space
 
03:14:49.250 --> 03:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
about a year or so ago and So within
 
03:14:51.170 --> 03:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
this budget are the funds necessary to
 
03:14:55.849 --> 03:14:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:57.769 --> 03:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
somewhere within the area don't know
 
03:15:00.889 --> 03:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
exactly we'd have to yeah yeah well
 
03:15:03.530 --> 03:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Murray
 
03:15:05.809 --> 03:15:05.819 align:start position:0%
thank you um the proprietorized needs
 
03:15:07.010 --> 03:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
they're quite they're you know quite
 
03:15:07.020 --> 03:15:07.969 align:start position:0%
they're quite they're you know quite
modest

03:15:07.969 --> 03:15:07.979 align:start position:0%
modest
 
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
um but I'm still curious can you speak
 
03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:11.090 align:start position:0%
um but I'm still curious can you speak
to

03:15:11.090 --> 03:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:15:13.309 --> 03:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that you've seen with doing
 
03:15:15.769 --> 03:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
more stuff online and is there more
 
03:15:17.450 --> 03:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
things are there more things that you
 
03:15:19.490 --> 03:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
can do online that you're looking at in
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:26.690 --> 03:15:26.700 align:start position:0%
sure I'll try with one recently I know
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
that they um
 
03:15:31.849 --> 03:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
they had been working on efficiency to
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
register commercial vehicles and I know
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
that I recently read something from the
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
DMV where they were able to process I
 
03:15:41.929 --> 03:15:41.939 align:start position:0%
believe the largest trucking company in
 
03:15:46.010 --> 03:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
the state in one day due to their online
 
03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
and due to their improvements which
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
would have taken I believe several weeks
 
03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:52.190 align:start position:0%
would have taken I believe several weeks
so

03:15:52.190 --> 03:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:54.349 --> 03:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
um you know they've they've really moved
 
03:15:56.269 --> 03:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
forward with with some areas of the
 
03:15:57.769 --> 03:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
commercial they've been focused on that
 
03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
and they've got other other areas in the
 
03:16:02.150 --> 03:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the queue and I think you know
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
director Lavoy can can speak to one area
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
where he's looking at with the the
 
03:16:08.570 --> 03:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
license plates and the decals and the
 
03:16:10.190 --> 03:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
process that we're trying to Target to
 
03:16:14.570 --> 03:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so um the IRP registration was was
 
03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
huge so that was something that used to
 
03:16:22.130 --> 03:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
happen internally with our staff over
 
03:16:24.769 --> 03:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
several weeks and um that was now able
 
03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
to happen with the company themselves
 
03:16:28.730 --> 03:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
through the online portal with our
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
assistance uh within within hours so
 
03:16:34.370 --> 03:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
those are those are big efficiencies
 
03:16:36.230 --> 03:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
um the the efficiency the commissioner
 
03:16:38.210 --> 03:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
is speaking to is I mentioned the plate
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
room functions in the division of
 
03:16:40.319 --> 03:16:41.809 align:start position:0%
room functions in the division of
administration

03:16:41.809 --> 03:16:41.819 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
um we have uh we're looking at
 
03:16:46.490 --> 03:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
modernizing that inventory system and
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
moving to a push instead of a pull
 
03:16:51.769 --> 03:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
inventory we sh we know what type of
 
03:16:54.010 --> 03:16:54.020 align:start position:0%
plates and the volumes that the
 
03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities have historically and so
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
we should be able to forecast and
 
03:17:02.090 --> 03:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
deliver those ahead of time instead of
 
03:17:04.730 --> 03:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
waiting for them to run low and relying
 
03:17:06.050 --> 03:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
on on them to make sure that their
 
03:17:09.290 --> 03:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
inventory counts are are adequate so um
 
03:17:10.670 --> 03:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
so we have funding that we've received
 
03:17:11.690 --> 03:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:12.429 align:start position:0%
for that
um

03:17:12.429 --> 03:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
Federal through go for funding so arpa
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
funds and we're working on that type of
 
03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
project right uh on the on the irps now
 
03:17:22.610 --> 03:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
is there an intermediary company that uh
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
does it for the in other words they they
 
03:17:27.290 --> 03:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
grew because they need obviously to be
 
03:17:29.570 --> 03:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
registered across the country and
 
03:17:32.510 --> 03:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
usually a company another company
 
03:17:34.190 --> 03:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
no they can they've done it themselves
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
they're doing it themselves okay so
 
03:17:38.450 --> 03:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's what's nice the IRP program
 
03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
itself allows them to register here and
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
then um conduct business across the
 
03:17:44.750 --> 03:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
country oh okay yeah thank you
 
03:17:47.150 --> 03:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
 
03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:50.929 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
um

03:17:50.929 --> 03:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:55.070 --> 03:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
oit seems to be of all the budgets I've
 
03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
heard they're tired and higher and
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
higher now are they accommodating all
 
03:18:02.330 --> 03:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
these upgrades that you're doing or do
 
03:18:04.910 --> 03:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
you have to hire other people to come in
 
03:18:09.170 --> 03:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.670 --> 03:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's a mix
 
03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
it's a mix
um

03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:14.330 --> 03:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
they they do whatever they can they're
 
03:18:17.330 --> 03:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
our first stop so we we try to utilize
 
03:18:19.730 --> 03:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
doit and the Staffing the services that
 
03:18:20.570 --> 03:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
um whenever we can but sometimes some of
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
these systems are just so large in scope
 
03:18:27.410 --> 03:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
that doit can't support us and can't
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
help us develop it in those cases we do
 
03:18:32.990 --> 03:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
go external with with contractors now
 
03:18:37.610 --> 03:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
does dot doit help you find contractors
 
03:18:40.849 --> 03:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
that will assist you in promoting the
 
03:18:43.070 --> 03:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
best possible options yes they're
 
03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
they're fully engaged in the whole
 
03:18:47.090 --> 03:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
process from procurement through
 
03:18:48.830 --> 03:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
Contracting through day-to-day
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
management so they're being managed by
 
03:18:53.809 --> 03:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
doit on our behalf great thank you and
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'll just add to that too they um we
 
03:18:58.010 --> 03:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
have a standing meeting our directors
 
03:18:59.889 --> 03:18:59.899 align:start position:0%
with the doit team
 
03:19:03.230 --> 03:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
our point of contact has been very
 
03:19:06.170 --> 03:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
helpful he guides us he leads through
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
these you know below commissioner Goulet
 
03:19:11.929 --> 03:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
but the support that I see from doit is
 
03:19:14.570 --> 03:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
is fantastic
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray now thank you for
 
03:19:19.790 --> 03:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
your patience what does IRP stand for
 
03:19:21.889 --> 03:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
see ya yep
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
um the international registration
 
03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
program and it's International because
 
03:19:28.250 --> 03:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
it includes the provinces up in Canada
 
03:19:29.809 --> 03:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I so director
 
03:19:33.889 --> 03:19:33.899 align:start position:0%
morasko at the DMV he has a lot of
 
03:19:35.210 --> 03:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
projects in the air one of the other
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
things he's looking at now is e-title
 
03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
and e-lean you know moving those to an
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
electronic phase so again it takes a
 
03:19:44.030 --> 03:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
project a document project management
 
03:19:45.650 --> 03:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
you need the right team in there you
 
03:19:48.530 --> 03:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
need the funding and um and they they do
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
it the right way some of these things
 
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
take time but at the end um it it's got
 
03:19:55.790 --> 03:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
and and as far as the vehicles uh in the
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement portion of it are we see in
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
the trucks in better shape or I mean how
 
03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
how is that how is that going as far as
 
03:20:12.170 --> 03:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
well financially as well as the number
 
03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
of trucks that you have to cite
 
03:20:18.490 --> 03:20:18.500 align:start position:0%
you know that that no not me I'm not
 
03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
roadworthy sure you know I I don't think
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm prepared to answer that question
 
03:20:25.130 --> 03:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
today I mean part of Troop G is the
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
commercial enforcement section but I
 
03:20:30.110 --> 03:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
will say this they have a tremendous
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
relationship with the industry so that
 
03:20:35.870 --> 03:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
we educate and they all understand the
 
03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
importance of safety uh the inspection
 
03:20:40.670 --> 03:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
um the whole issue with commercial
 
03:20:44.809 --> 03:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
drivers and CDL we just worked on a on a
 
03:20:47.389 --> 03:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
on a video a professional video on
 
03:20:49.610 --> 03:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
preparing them on the pre-trip the test
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
so that they can really focus on safety
 
03:20:55.849 --> 03:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
and um so I think I can't tell you here
 
03:20:58.190 --> 03:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
how many right I would say that the
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
industry and the enforcement uh arm of
 
03:21:04.370 --> 03:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
the State Police have a very close
 
03:21:04.380 --> 03:21:05.630 align:start position:0%
the State Police have a very close
relationship

03:21:05.630 --> 03:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:10.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

03:21:10.490 --> 03:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.590 --> 03:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the prioritized needs
 
03:21:15.889 --> 03:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
for the Division of Motor Vehicles there
 
03:21:18.170 --> 03:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
are four existing data control clerk
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
three positions and these are these are
 
03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
vacant currently but they are positions
 
03:21:26.570 --> 03:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
we we do have budgeted in 2223 and that
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
we typically have filled and they're
 
03:21:30.590 --> 03:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're critical in ensuring
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
that we process driver history record
 
03:21:35.090 --> 03:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
accident Data Ticket payments um and
 
03:21:37.550 --> 03:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
making sure there's no delays in that
 
03:21:40.190 --> 03:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
area the other piece is an increase in
 
03:21:42.950 --> 03:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
credit card fees so we've seen more
 
03:21:44.929 --> 03:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
credit card usage as we continue to move
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
online for services
 
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
right now the department does not charge
 
03:21:52.250 --> 03:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
a convenience fee for use of a credit
 
03:21:55.610 --> 03:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
card and because of that we need
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
additional funding to to cover those
 
03:21:58.080 --> 03:21:59.170 align:start position:0%
additional funding to to cover those
costs

03:21:59.170 --> 03:21:59.180 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
we may be in a position to start
 
03:22:03.290 --> 03:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
charging a convenience fee because we're
 
03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
seeing so much growth in this area and
 
03:22:06.769 --> 03:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
that's something we're talking about
 
03:22:06.779 --> 03:22:08.110 align:start position:0%
that's something we're talking about
internally

03:22:08.110 --> 03:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
internally
 
03:22:10.490 --> 03:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
if we don't have this funding it would
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
really Force us into that that decision
 
03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr do you need
 
03:22:19.010 --> 03:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
any Authority for that or is that within
 
03:22:20.809 --> 03:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
your purview so that's within our
 
03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
purview we have the authority by Statute
 
03:22:25.010 --> 03:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
to make that to make that decision thank
 
03:22:25.020 --> 03:22:27.950 align:start position:0%
to make that to make that decision thank
you

03:22:27.950 --> 03:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:27.960 --> 03:22:29.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:32.809 --> 03:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
DMV security enhancements so this is a
 
03:22:35.210 --> 03:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
priority of the the director
 
03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
um the this funding would allow the DMV
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
to install protective glass at the
 
03:22:42.170 --> 03:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
counters across the state and then also
 
03:22:44.330 --> 03:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
hire part-time security monitors at the
 
03:22:46.969 --> 03:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
higher volume locations there's been
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
issues that we've had at certain
 
03:22:51.889 --> 03:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
locations where customers you know can
 
03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
get upset
 
03:22:55.130 --> 03:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
um and and we want to make sure that our
 
03:22:58.130 --> 03:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
employees feel secure and comfortable uh
 
03:23:01.190 --> 03:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's a retention issue really as well as
 
03:23:02.450 --> 03:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
we're always trying to make sure that we
 
03:23:03.889 --> 03:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
hire the right people and get them to
 
03:23:06.410 --> 03:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
stay so that's that that's an important
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
an important need at this point
 
03:23:12.889 --> 03:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
and then finally the uh opening a new
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
DMV substation in the Plymouth area so
 
03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
right now individuals who live in The
 
03:23:19.610 --> 03:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region have the choice to go to
 
03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
Concord or up to Tamworth in either case
 
03:23:25.969 --> 03:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a drive the wait lines in
 
03:23:27.650 --> 03:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
both of those areas are start you know
 
03:23:30.050 --> 03:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
are pretty steady and they're starting
 
03:23:31.370 --> 03:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
to increase as there's more people
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
living in and around the Lakes Region
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
area a Plymouth area location would
 
03:23:39.349 --> 03:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
would help to alleviate that demand and
 
03:23:45.229 --> 03:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:47.090 --> 03:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
03:23:50.090 --> 03:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
um if we open the Plymouth will Tamworth
 
03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
stay open
 
03:23:56.570 --> 03:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
Yeah Tim would would stay open there's
 
03:23:58.309 --> 03:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
still a need for services in that area
 
03:24:03.769 --> 03:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know we recognize before any
 
03:24:07.790 --> 03:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
decisions that made customer services is
 
03:24:09.950 --> 03:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
a priority too but the prior question if
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're not in Epping where would it be
 
03:24:13.729 --> 03:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
you know we're aware that services are
 
03:24:16.729 --> 03:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
available in Dover and and Salem but in
 
03:24:18.830 --> 03:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester about what you know how do we
 
03:24:21.410 --> 03:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
not impact customers and reduce the
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.490 --> 03:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay so uh moving on to the division of
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:34.969 --> 03:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I forgot to ask this question
 
03:24:34.979 --> 03:24:36.530 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I forgot to ask this question
before

03:24:36.530 --> 03:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:24:36.540 --> 03:24:37.130 align:start position:0%
before
um

03:24:37.130 --> 03:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:39.469 --> 03:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
in in the cost of collections
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the yellow bars here where it says 30
 
03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:43.070 align:start position:0%
in the yellow bars here where it says 30
million

03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
is that come off the top of Highway
 
03:24:48.889 --> 03:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
funds first correct yep yep before so
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
the any of the revenues collected from
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
DMV transactions
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
um before that money gets deposited into
 
03:24:57.229 --> 03:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
the highway fund uh the costs for that
 
03:24:58.969 --> 03:24:58.979 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
um are covered through this cost thank
 
03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
um are covered through this cost thank
you

03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.969 --> 03:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
the division of State Police on page
 
03:25:11.769 --> 03:25:11.779 align:start position:0%
seven the budget request for foi 24 is
 
03:25:15.290 --> 03:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
114 million which is a 10 increase from
 
03:25:19.450 --> 03:25:19.460 align:start position:0%
FY 23 and then for fy25 is
 
03:25:21.769 --> 03:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
113.4 million
 
03:25:24.830 --> 03:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
the division of State Police have 578
 
03:25:28.250 --> 03:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
classified in one unclassified full-time
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
position there are 21 unfunded positions
 
03:25:34.250 --> 03:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
but as I mentioned 17 of those are
 
03:25:36.650 --> 03:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
troopers from previous uh previous
 
03:25:38.210 --> 03:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
biennium that have not been funded
 
03:25:40.849 --> 03:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
recently but there are some positions
 
03:25:42.290 --> 03:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about those that are new
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
positions that we're we're asking for
 
03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:46.309 align:start position:0%
positions that we're we're asking for
consideration

03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:25:51.530 --> 03:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
in FY 22 State Police Stopped 74 671
 
03:25:54.889 --> 03:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles arrested 753 impaired
 
03:25:58.490 --> 03:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
drivers conducted 6299 criminal
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
investigations conducted 106 446
 
03:26:04.190 --> 03:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle inspections and
 
03:26:08.450 --> 03:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
weight checks they process 69 569 sets
 
03:26:11.690 --> 03:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
um the summary of significant changes
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the division 4.2 million of the
 
03:26:19.190 --> 03:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
increase in 24 and 3.8 million of the
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
increase in 25 is due to increased costs
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
for replacement equipment including
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
portable radios and fleet vehicles the
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
fleet vehicle replacement plan has
 
03:26:31.929 --> 03:26:31.939 align:start position:0%
really never been fully funded
 
03:26:35.450 --> 03:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
and it's limited our ability to ensure
 
03:26:37.190 --> 03:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we have a healthy Fleet so at this
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
point we have high mileage vehicles that
 
03:26:41.450 --> 03:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
are often breaking down and need repair
 
03:26:44.210 --> 03:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
and our repair costs are going up and
 
03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
finding spare Vehicles is also a
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
challenge and the key here is that a
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
trooper without a vehicle can't perform
 
03:26:52.370 --> 03:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
their their function we want to make
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
sure Troopers stay on the road as much
 
03:26:56.690 --> 03:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
as possible and not because of be off
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
the road because of equipment concerns
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
So within this budget we do have 70
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are be funded replacement
 
03:27:07.510 --> 03:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles in 24 and 76 and 25
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
that helps to make a dent but then there
 
03:27:13.250 --> 03:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
there's a it doesn't help us meet our
 
03:27:17.090 --> 03:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
Target to get to our Target there is
 
03:27:19.370 --> 03:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
money in House Bill 2 to purchase an
 
03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
additional 52 vehicles for state police
 
03:27:25.490 --> 03:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
that will reset and bring us back to
 
03:27:27.710 --> 03:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
where we need to to have a fleet that's
 
03:27:29.330 --> 03:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
healthy that we can maintain with our
 
03:27:31.490 --> 03:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
existing repair staff and we'll start to
 
03:27:33.410 --> 03:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
see decreases in our maintenance costs
 
03:27:36.170 --> 03:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
moving forward as well representative
 
03:27:39.050 --> 03:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
Weiler thank you what's the total number
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
of state troopers on the road with
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles we have 360 uh Troopers so each
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
Trooper would need a vehicle and then
 
03:27:49.969 --> 03:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
our Target is to have 400 Vehicles which
 
03:27:53.090 --> 03:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
gives us the the 40 spare so we can make
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
sure everyone stays on the road
 
03:27:58.010 --> 03:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
I remember when it was 200.
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
probably probably the director does too
 
03:28:05.630 --> 03:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
how much if I may uh how much more is a
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle today say than five years ago I
 
03:28:09.050 --> 03:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
mean give you know this
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know it because it it seems like
 
03:28:12.889 --> 03:28:12.899 align:start position:0%
they're on a steep climb as far as the
 
03:28:14.870 --> 03:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
cost and what what is it today versus
 
03:28:18.889 --> 03:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
yeah so so we we're budgeting between 65
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
and 75 uh per vehicle that's full fit up
 
03:28:25.370 --> 03:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
so that's the vehicle plus
 
03:28:28.190 --> 03:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
um lights radio paint everything to put
 
03:28:29.870 --> 03:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
it into service
 
03:28:32.450 --> 03:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't have the exact amount of
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
what yeah I mean I'm looking for you
 
03:28:36.290 --> 03:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
know I'm looking for the it's been it's
 
03:28:38.450 --> 03:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
been increasing we used to budget uh
 
03:28:40.670 --> 03:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
closer to you know in the 50 to 60 range
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
and now we're we're at 65 75 range so
 
03:28:46.190 --> 03:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
and and can you get these vehicles now I
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
mean well that's the that's the trick
 
03:28:50.210 --> 03:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
that that's the issue so even in the
 
03:28:52.010 --> 03:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
prior years when we had funding for
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
Replacements we weren't able to purchase
 
03:28:56.090 --> 03:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
as many as we had intended because the
 
03:28:58.429 --> 03:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturing lines shut down
 
03:29:01.070 --> 03:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a supply chain issue we
 
03:29:04.130 --> 03:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
can't guarantee we're able to but we
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we have the
 
03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to give us the
 
03:29:06.420 --> 03:29:07.670 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to give us the
opportunity

03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:29:09.170 --> 03:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
um otherwise we're always going to be
 
03:29:11.929 --> 03:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
chasing our tail and I will tell you I I
 
03:29:14.210 --> 03:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
meet with the state police that are
 
03:29:15.769 --> 03:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
assigned to managing that there's
 
03:29:17.809 --> 03:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
actually a woman that oversees that and
 
03:29:19.969 --> 03:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
as quick as we can get the car carriers
 
03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
in and get the vehicles transported down
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
so they are they are like on top of it
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
and it's just a matter of getting us in
 
03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
and once the vehicles get in they wait
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
till they get them all so that they
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
paint them all at once and they start
 
03:29:35.690 --> 03:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
upfitting them and it's a process and we
 
03:29:38.510 --> 03:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
do everything we can so that we stay you
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
know so to speak at the top of the line
 
03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
and we're not holding them up at all so
 
03:29:46.250 --> 03:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
it really is a it's it's impacting
 
03:29:48.290 --> 03:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
you'll see law enforcement across the
 
03:29:49.610 --> 03:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
country but we're doing everything we
 
03:29:51.469 --> 03:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
can and I and I and I know that they are
 
03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I think I heard you say
 
03:29:57.889 --> 03:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
that there's 52 new vehicles listed in
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 and that would get you fully
 
03:30:03.530 --> 03:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
functional right
 
03:30:05.929 --> 03:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
um going forward what do you need to
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
maintain full functionality did will
 
03:30:10.370 --> 03:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
this go down because you have 52 new
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles and so going forward I would
 
03:30:14.090 --> 03:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
assume that there would be less requests
 
03:30:15.349 --> 03:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll take a little stab so I
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
mean Steve's got a financial and a
 
03:30:20.160 --> 03:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
mean Steve's got a financial and a
strategic

03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
03:30:21.600 --> 03:30:23.389 align:start position:0%
strategic
um

03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:25.610 --> 03:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
thought process but if you have so many
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
Troopers you can really look at what is
 
03:30:29.570 --> 03:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
our vehicle replacement plan and they've
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
looked at that knowing how many miles
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
they might put on a year at one point is
 
03:30:35.150 --> 03:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
it diminishing returns of you know
 
03:30:37.490 --> 03:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
fixing the vehicles they can they can
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
build into that how many unfortunately
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
might be involved in a crash per year
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
but really they can look at it and they
 
03:30:45.530 --> 03:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
have the metrics too how do we want to
 
03:30:47.210 --> 03:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
budget you know
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
I would say conservatively but to not
 
03:30:52.250 --> 03:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
impact Public Safety and and I know that
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
Steve Works closely with that so it
 
03:30:56.809 --> 03:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
really is based on Miles and
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
unanticipated crashes mechanical failure
 
03:31:00.769 --> 03:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
but that's that's really how we do
 
03:31:04.269 --> 03:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
overall budget for the fleet
 
03:31:07.849 --> 03:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
you're spot on and I mean I I'll give
 
03:31:09.410 --> 03:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
you a range of numbers I don't want to
 
03:31:10.849 --> 03:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
commit to a number
 
03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
um obviously because of all those
 
03:31:14.450 --> 03:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
variables but we'll be backed into the
 
03:31:16.969 --> 03:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
normal requests when I say normal
 
03:31:19.729 --> 03:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
um anywhere from the 40 to 50 vehicle
 
03:31:23.210 --> 03:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
range per year instead of the 70 to 100
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle range per year so that's that
 
03:31:30.050 --> 03:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
factors in about a dozen crashes that
 
03:31:32.809 --> 03:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
end up in a total vehicle every year
 
03:31:32.819 --> 03:31:33.530 align:start position:0%
end up in a total vehicle every year
um

03:31:33.530 --> 03:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
aging out for mileage at about 150 130
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
150 000 mile range
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
um making sure we have those spare
 
03:31:44.330 --> 03:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are functioning so you'd
 
03:31:45.769 --> 03:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
see you would see
 
03:31:48.010 --> 03:31:48.020 align:start position:0%
requests that mirrored prior years
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the summary of
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
significant changes 2.2 million of the
 
03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
increase and 1.7 in 24 and 1.7 of the
 
03:32:08.210 --> 03:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
increase in 25 are due to increased
 
03:32:10.670 --> 03:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
operating expenses this is mainly fuel
 
03:32:12.410 --> 03:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
vehicle maintenance and repair costs
 
03:32:14.450 --> 03:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
again we talked about costs increasing
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
across the board and that's reflected
 
03:32:15.960 --> 03:32:16.809 align:start position:0%
across the board and that's reflected
here

03:32:16.809 --> 03:32:16.819 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:32:19.969 --> 03:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
1.1 million of the increase in 24 and
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
888 000 of the increase in 25 are due to
 
03:32:27.050 --> 03:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
increased costs for it systems so here's
 
03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
our doit expenses again this is
 
03:32:30.889 --> 03:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
computer-aided dispatch and the records
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
management system and then also
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the state's message
 
03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
platform and that's used to pass
 
03:32:38.090 --> 03:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
criminal justice information to the
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
different recipients across the state
 
03:32:42.650 --> 03:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
the program you might have heard of is
 
03:32:44.809 --> 03:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
J1 the system that ensures that we're
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
communicating with the courts and
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
Corrections and DMV and State Police so
 
03:32:50.510 --> 03:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
that platform has to stay up and running
 
03:32:53.450 --> 03:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
right so so how much more is it costing
 
03:32:56.450 --> 03:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
you for cyber security I mean is it a
 
03:32:57.469 --> 03:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
tax more
 
03:33:00.050 --> 03:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
more prevalent now I mean what
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
it seems so that you hear a lot about
 
03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
that in the news uh these you know
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
agencies being attacked and you know it
 
03:33:09.849 --> 03:33:09.859 align:start position:0%
and and of course we see doit costs are
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing as my in my opinion sure
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
well I think that I mean Steve can we
 
03:33:16.969 --> 03:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
can speak to it but we have invested in
 
03:33:19.130 --> 03:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
training in some infrastructure we work
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
closely with the oit on cyber security
 
03:33:24.769 --> 03:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
but you know the impact on us the cost
 
03:33:27.050 --> 03:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
um they work very hard to protect our
 
03:33:29.809 --> 03:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
data and have the proper firewalls of
 
03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
the state network but it's something
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
that you absolutely have to pay
 
03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
attention to and continue to
 
03:33:37.969 --> 03:33:37.979 align:start position:0%
um to invest to stay current if you've
 
03:33:41.150 --> 03:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
ever put a number to that you know the I
 
03:33:43.969 --> 03:33:43.979 align:start position:0%
mean it's we've there's been some recent
 
03:33:45.769 --> 03:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
Grant dollars that have been put forward
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
to advancing cyber security but Steve
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I think
 
03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:52.809 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I think
um

03:33:52.809 --> 03:33:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
you could put a number to it but it
 
03:33:56.690 --> 03:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be accurate because it's
 
03:33:58.250 --> 03:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
involved in everything that we're doing
 
03:34:01.010 --> 03:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
now and so doit is considering cyber
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
security risk and factoring that into
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
new contracts to new vendors to the
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
network itself which equipment are they
 
03:34:08.929 --> 03:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
purchasing and why how are they setting
 
03:34:10.849 --> 03:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
it up and so you can't really extract
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
the true cost there but like the
 
03:34:13.849 --> 03:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned there's there's
 
03:34:16.130 --> 03:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
Federal money through Homeland Security
 
03:34:18.410 --> 03:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's being made available now
 
03:34:19.910 --> 03:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
um in fact when we get to House Bill 2
 
03:34:21.050 --> 03:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
you will see there's a matching
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
component that's appropriated to to
 
03:34:26.570 --> 03:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
support the state's share of the of the
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds for that program which is
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
really looking Statewide and for
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
government at state and local levels on
 
03:34:35.809 --> 03:34:35.819 align:start position:0%
how can we improve cyber security at all
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
levels of government
 
03:34:40.130 --> 03:34:40.140 align:start position:0%
but but to put a just a single dollar
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
so 2.7 million of the increase in 24 and
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
3.9 million of the increase in 25 for
 
03:34:58.010 --> 03:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
the division of State Police are due to
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
increases in risk and benefit amounts
 
03:35:02.090 --> 03:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
that's retiree health workers comp
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty Insurance
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
and then finally 630 000 of the increase
 
03:35:08.809 --> 03:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
in funding
 
03:35:10.429 --> 03:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
um is
 
03:35:12.889 --> 03:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
specific to part-time auxiliary Troopers
 
03:35:14.450 --> 03:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
and so that's to ensure that we fully
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
fund the part-time Troopers that we have
 
03:35:16.080 --> 03:35:17.269 align:start position:0%
fund the part-time Troopers that we have
currently

03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
um to address ongoing demands for for
 
03:35:23.210 --> 03:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you um I think the
 
03:35:27.410 --> 03:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
last time we were here we talked a
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
little bit about the difficulty of
 
03:35:31.250 --> 03:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
getting employees so I guess they have
 
03:35:34.670 --> 03:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
two questions one how big was your lapse
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
up for an inability to hire employees
 
03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
and how are you doing enticing people to
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
um become state troopers
 
03:35:49.490 --> 03:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
the lapse sure so so on back on page
 
03:35:49.500 --> 03:35:50.630 align:start position:0%
the lapse sure so so on back on page
three

03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
um we show the overall lapse by fun
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of that is salary
 
03:35:57.050 --> 03:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
and benefits I mean there there were
 
03:35:58.670 --> 03:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
some because of equipment costs like I
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned but it's really it the
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
vacancies have been significant I mean
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
there were there was a point where we
 
03:36:07.550 --> 03:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
were over 20 as a department
 
03:36:10.990 --> 03:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
um we're far better now we're around 16
 
03:36:13.250 --> 03:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
the last time
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
um that that we got the reporting out
 
03:36:17.210 --> 03:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
and that and that varies by division
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's some divisions that are worse
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's than 16 there's some divisions
 
03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
that are lower
 
03:36:25.070 --> 03:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
um but we're starting to see more
 
03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:26.809 align:start position:0%
um but we're starting to see more
applicants

03:36:26.809 --> 03:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
03:36:29.450 --> 03:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
and and that's the big change so six
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
months ago we weren't even seeing a
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
large number of applicants for positions
 
03:36:35.450 --> 03:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing applicants and and now
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're able to bring people in and have
 
03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
discussions we they may or may not be
 
03:36:41.090 --> 03:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
the right applicants but we're starting
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
to see applicants the pay raise will
 
03:36:45.229 --> 03:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
help pay raise will help significantly I
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
mean that that that's the issue uh we're
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
trying to recruit we're trying to
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
incentivize people uh we have some some
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
things that were that were incentives
 
03:36:56.809 --> 03:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
that we've had passed for Troopers for
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement we have referral bonuses
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
for civilian employees and we're always
 
03:37:03.170 --> 03:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
talking internally at talk talk to your
 
03:37:04.729 --> 03:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
friends talk to your family who's
 
03:37:07.130 --> 03:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
looking for work but it's the pet and it
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
always comes back they're they're not
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Buco thank you Mr
 
03:37:16.080 --> 03:37:17.389 align:start position:0%
representative Buco thank you Mr
chairman

03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
um we we have not had to lower our
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
standards in order to attract people
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
have we no I will say this Colonel noise
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
has a fantastic team uh he is the leader
 
03:37:29.330 --> 03:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire State Police I'm
 
03:37:31.510 --> 03:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of positive movement there
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
and I do see you know since some changes
 
03:37:36.889 --> 03:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
have been made we are not seeing uh the
 
03:37:36.899 --> 03:37:38.389 align:start position:0%
have been made we are not seeing uh the
resignations

03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
resignations
 
03:37:41.090 --> 03:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
um which is really important and there's
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh interest and excitement in
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
joining his team and he he has not uh
 
03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
and nor will they ever
 
03:37:51.050 --> 03:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
um make any significant changes their
 
03:37:54.530 --> 03:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
standards so I'm very um
 
03:37:56.690 --> 03:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
very pleased with what we're seeing now
 
03:37:59.630 --> 03:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
this is an issue Nationwide but they're
 
03:38:02.090 --> 03:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
making Improvement in uh and they're
 
03:38:06.410 --> 03:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
I think so I you know and I I travel
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
across country quite a bit and I'll tell
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
you our state trooper is probably the
 
03:38:17.450 --> 03:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
best in the country you know and of
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
course we have to retrain them after
 
03:38:21.650 --> 03:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
they go to California like well I want I
 
03:38:23.210 --> 03:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for saying it well
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's I mean we got the
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
best I mean they the vehicles look nice
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
I mean you know we you can be proud of
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
what we have well thank you I'll convey
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
so page eight lists the prioritized
 
03:38:41.809 --> 03:38:41.819 align:start position:0%
needs for the division of State Police
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
so first uh and again the first two
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
items are new positions the first one is
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
a new criminalist one positions within
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
the lab
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
two of these are within the forensic
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
biology unit and that's an area that um
 
03:38:59.410 --> 03:38:59.420 align:start position:0%
demand has more than tripled since 2012
 
03:39:01.370 --> 03:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
and it's really an area that's
 
03:39:03.410 --> 03:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
understaffed we are implementing new
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
technologies in that area to help speed
 
03:39:07.610 --> 03:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
up the processing but we still need
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
individuals to analyze the results
 
03:39:13.010 --> 03:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
and these are the the positions that we
 
03:39:15.530 --> 03:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
would need there is a third criminalist
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
position and that would be required in
 
03:39:19.370 --> 03:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
the toxicology lab and that's to address
 
03:39:21.050 --> 03:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
increased demand for services and
 
03:39:23.690 --> 03:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
testing for for drug samples especially
 
03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
as the substances continue to evolve and
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
change and the the testing is not
 
03:39:31.929 --> 03:39:31.939 align:start position:0%
declining in that area
 
03:39:34.370 --> 03:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
there's a program specialist three which
 
03:39:36.650 --> 03:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
is a new position in the traffic Bureau
 
03:39:39.050 --> 03:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
within the digital evidence unit and
 
03:39:40.370 --> 03:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
this is the unit that was created with
 
03:39:43.010 --> 03:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
the rollout of the body camera
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
program and dash cameras and so when
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
we're generating video evidence
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
um there's an increased demand for
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
copies of that evidence and we can't
 
03:39:58.250 --> 03:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
just turn video over unscrubbed and so
 
03:39:59.929 --> 03:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
you need to redact things that shouldn't
 
03:40:01.969 --> 03:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
people don't need to see and go through
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
that process and as that increases we
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
need additional resources who can who
 
03:40:07.370 --> 03:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
can perform that function for state
 
03:40:07.380 --> 03:40:08.210 align:start position:0%
can perform that function for state
police

03:40:08.210 --> 03:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
police
 
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the 1.6 million each
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
year these are those 17 positions that
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
had been previously unfunded so if these
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
were funded this would allow us to
 
03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
expand patrols
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
um but in the current budget we're
 
03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining at the existing levels of
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
service I just want to add going back to
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
the top you know director Lavoy spoke of
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
new technologies in the lab I just want
 
03:40:32.210 --> 03:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
to say that these are significant this
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
will advance the capabilities of DNA
 
03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:36.779 align:start position:0%
testing and we'll um will support
 
03:40:39.650 --> 03:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
victims in the future so it is really
 
03:40:39.660 --> 03:40:40.450 align:start position:0%
victims in the future so it is really
really

03:40:40.450 --> 03:40:40.460 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
exciting what they're doing in there
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative mother thank you Mr chair
 
03:40:48.490 --> 03:40:48.500 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on the
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
additional positions that you want to
 
03:40:54.170 --> 03:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
increase the safety Patrols
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
they were unfunded because you you know
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
were unable to hire people or they were
 
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
just unfunded and if we do you know
 
03:41:03.050 --> 03:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
allocate those funds what's your
 
03:41:05.450 --> 03:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
confidence in being able to hire the
 
03:41:09.170 --> 03:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
people to implement the patrols
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
so that that's a good question I and I
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
think I think what director Lavoy has
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
tried to do is just keep those there and
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
put those there those are unfunded I
 
03:41:21.010 --> 03:41:21.020 align:start position:0%
want to say
 
03:41:24.410 --> 03:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
yeah those have been unfunded for many
 
03:41:27.889 --> 03:41:27.899 align:start position:0%
many budget Cycles so I mean my my focus
 
03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
is on primarily the positions that we're
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
looking for now and the colonel has a
 
03:41:35.330 --> 03:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
plan to um what we've asked for that we
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
think we can fill them uh over the next
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
two years but these I think it's
 
03:41:41.809 --> 03:41:41.819 align:start position:0%
important that everyone's aware that at
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
one point they were there
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and if it's just for awareness but I
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to over commit that we could
 
03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
fill all of those positions but we are
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
committing to the positions we've asked
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
for in the budget thank you
 
03:41:56.030 --> 03:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
ah thank you again I can I propose the
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
um the traffic Bureau the program
 
03:42:02.690 --> 03:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
specialist can you speak just generally
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
around privacy issues and how
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
um those body camera videos
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
are you know the security around those
 
03:42:15.290 --> 03:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
devices and uh just because this has
 
03:42:17.929 --> 03:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
been in the news fairly recently
 
03:42:20.090 --> 03:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
um do the Troopers carry their own cell
 
03:42:22.130 --> 03:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
phones or is that not allowed in terms
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
of because you know they're I'm
 
03:42:25.610 --> 03:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
referring to incidents where police have
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
used their cell phones to you know video
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of an incident and then it
 
03:42:31.370 --> 03:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
goes out into the public and you just
 
03:42:34.250 --> 03:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
speak to us about how you address that
 
03:42:36.349 --> 03:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
sure well with with the body cameras and
 
03:42:38.570 --> 03:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
the cruiser cameras this unit
 
03:42:40.729 --> 03:42:40.739 align:start position:0%
um just to keep it simple they follow
 
03:42:43.729 --> 03:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
the law so there's a law that um really
 
03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
guides what is you know what can be
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
released what can't be released how it
 
03:42:50.570 --> 03:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
is used in a criminal case
 
03:42:54.290 --> 03:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
um we are continually looking to ensure
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
my goal would be to have every state
 
03:42:59.150 --> 03:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
trooper have a cell phone have a state
 
03:43:02.450 --> 03:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
issued phone so we are we are looking at
 
03:43:04.849 --> 03:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
that right now and and I believe it's
 
03:43:07.130 --> 03:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
important that if they have that they
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
have that equipment that that can be
 
03:43:15.250 --> 03:43:15.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.870 --> 03:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
I also understand that everybody needs
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
their own phone if they have to get
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
contacted by their or exactly your loved
 
03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
ones you know speaking of phones uh your
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
your signal around the state are you
 
03:43:28.610 --> 03:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
pretty much all covered now as far as
 
03:43:30.650 --> 03:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
your radios in the cars
 
03:43:32.690 --> 03:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
you know that that is a great question
 
03:43:35.690 --> 03:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
and what I what I will tell you is this
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
we have a Statewide interoperability
 
03:43:42.110 --> 03:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
coordinator Mr John Stevens that works
 
03:43:44.809 --> 03:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
over on Smokey Bear Boulevard he's
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
attached to the division of emergency
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
services and Communications which
 
03:43:51.530 --> 03:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
oversees the entire Statewide Network
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
and what they continually do is they
 
03:43:57.710 --> 03:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
have Engineers that test this that are
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
responsive and then we look to see what
 
03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing from the Troopers are
 
03:44:05.570 --> 03:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
there gaps they do the continual testing
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
then they will take that and they'll
 
03:44:08.809 --> 03:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
work with the engineers to see where and
 
03:44:11.450 --> 03:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
how we may fill these gaps I will say
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.330 --> 03:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
four to six years they have made
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
significant improvements with that not
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
only in improvements but in the
 
03:44:22.439 --> 03:44:24.010 align:start position:0%
only in improvements but in the
continual

03:44:24.010 --> 03:44:24.020 align:start position:0%
continual
 
03:44:27.170 --> 03:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
oversight and full Envision to where
 
03:44:29.150 --> 03:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
this needs to go what needs to be
 
03:44:31.990 --> 03:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
replaced when and why and um so I think
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think there are still
 
03:44:34.739 --> 03:44:36.229 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think there are still
gaps

03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
gaps
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
in certain places and now they're trying
 
03:44:39.650 --> 03:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
you know some of these gaps may be in
 
03:44:40.849 --> 03:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
remote areas where there's no
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
electricity or it's a little harder to
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
put a tower but in many areas they look
 
03:44:47.330 --> 03:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
and say we can leverage this existing
 
03:44:49.790 --> 03:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
Tower this existing equipment and fill
 
03:44:52.370 --> 03:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
that Gap in some areas it's training you
 
03:44:55.010 --> 03:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
might not be able to communicate on one
 
03:44:56.690 --> 03:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
channel but on the other and again I am
 
03:44:59.150 --> 03:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
not the the radio expert but I will say
 
03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
that we have a team that maintains it
 
03:45:05.150 --> 03:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
and we have folks that are working to uh
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
at a higher level with the engineers
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
right Steve you know yeah I know I I
 
03:45:12.410 --> 03:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
mean I don't really have anything to add
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
to that other other than even changes in
 
03:45:17.809 --> 03:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
technology help and that's the team that
 
03:45:19.309 --> 03:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
we have now are always looking at that
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I know recently they were able to
 
03:45:24.530 --> 03:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
um install new technology new equipment
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
on existing Towers to address gaps in
 
03:45:29.929 --> 03:45:29.939 align:start position:0%
the western part of the state things
 
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
that weren't available five years ago
 
03:45:33.650 --> 03:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
and so it's constantly evolving it's
 
03:45:34.729 --> 03:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
constantly something that that
 
03:45:38.269 --> 03:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.279 --> 03:45:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:45:43.370 --> 03:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:43.380 --> 03:45:44.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:45:44.570 --> 03:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
um moving on to page nine this is the
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
division of Homeland Security and
 
03:45:51.650 --> 03:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
hscm's budget request for fy24 is 27.4
 
03:45:59.530 --> 03:45:59.540 align:start position:0%
million for fy25 26.9 million
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
significant increase from FY 23.
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
obviously it's almost 56 increase and
 
03:46:09.170 --> 03:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
that's due primarily to the disaster
 
03:46:09.180 --> 03:46:10.370 align:start position:0%
that's due primarily to the disaster
funding

03:46:10.370 --> 03:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
um that we spoke about earlier and so
 
03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
these are
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
the disbursements of funds from previous
 
03:46:17.450 --> 03:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
disasters including covid which are
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
going to continue into the next biennium
 
03:46:20.809 --> 03:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
and so these would be reimbursements
 
03:46:23.929 --> 03:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
passing through Homeland to locals
 
03:46:26.769 --> 03:46:26.779 align:start position:0%
um that that have to be budgeted
 
03:46:29.929 --> 03:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
the division of Homeland Security has 42
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
classified and two unclassified
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
full-time positions there are two
 
03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:36.779 align:start position:0%
unfunded full-time positions that are
 
03:46:39.290 --> 03:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
existing vacant positions that are here
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
in prioritized needs
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
in FY 22 the division activated the
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
state Emergency Operations Center 10
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
times they facilitated 16 exercises and
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
67 trainings conducted 31 initial
 
03:46:54.410 --> 03:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
reviews and approved 44 local Hazard
 
03:46:56.570 --> 03:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
mitigation plans for locals and they
 
03:46:58.130 --> 03:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
awarded 35 Emergency Management
 
03:47:01.130 --> 03:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
performance grants to locals across the
 
03:47:01.140 --> 03:47:03.290 align:start position:0%
performance grants to locals across the
state

03:47:03.290 --> 03:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
the summary of significant changes for
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
24.25 1.9 million dollars of the
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
increase in 24 an additional 2.2 million
 
03:47:14.269 --> 03:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
and 25 is due to increase in salary and
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
benefits including Federal disaster
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
Grant funded temporary full-time
 
03:47:20.210 --> 03:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
positions this was a change in approach
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
that the division took over the last uh
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
over the last biennium and that's
 
03:47:27.889 --> 03:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we fully utilize the
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
management costs that come with these
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds to hire full-time
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
temporary federally funded roles to do
 
03:47:35.210 --> 03:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
the administrative work instead of
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
absorbing that with our state funded
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
positions and so it's the right
 
03:47:40.729 --> 03:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
direction to go but that's part of the
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
reason why there is an increase here too
 
03:47:45.530 --> 03:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
7.4 million dollars with the increase in
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
24 are due to increased Federal disaster
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
money distributed to State and local
 
03:47:51.650 --> 03:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
disaster responses
 
03:47:54.170 --> 03:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
there are seven open disasters and as I
 
03:47:56.090 --> 03:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned those remain open until all
 
03:47:57.769 --> 03:47:57.779 align:start position:0%
the bills are paid and so we need to
 
03:47:59.150 --> 03:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
make sure we have the Appropriations to
 
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
pass those funds through
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
78 000 of the increase in FY 24 and 80
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
000 in FY 25 is funding a new
 
03:48:10.849 --> 03:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
radiological instrument technician
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
position that's in the radiological
 
03:48:14.690 --> 03:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
instrument maintenance and calibration
 
03:48:16.969 --> 03:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
section this was at the request of
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
Seabrook station and these positions
 
03:48:21.889 --> 03:48:21.899 align:start position:0%
um it's funded by Seabrook station 100
 
03:48:24.410 --> 03:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
through the assessment that um
 
03:48:26.809 --> 03:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
that we Bill them and these are the
 
03:48:28.729 --> 03:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
positions that actually calibrate and
 
03:48:30.650 --> 03:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
test the radiological detection
 
03:48:34.610 --> 03:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
equipment within the epz
 
03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
he prioritize needs a position that we
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's two positions one is a
 
03:48:40.729 --> 03:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
program specialist one and the other is
 
03:48:43.849 --> 03:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
a program Assistant two and these are
 
03:48:46.729 --> 03:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
really required to conduct all of the
 
03:48:49.250 --> 03:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
functions at Homeland Security they help
 
03:48:51.170 --> 03:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
with training and exercise they're
 
03:48:52.729 --> 03:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
responding to radiological emergency
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
preparedness inquiries they're
 
03:48:58.010 --> 03:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
processing reimbursements reporting of
 
03:49:00.610 --> 03:49:00.620 align:start position:0%
federal draws of the complete
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
complete functions within Homeland
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
Security and those are existing
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
positions that are vacant
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
but have been filled over the last
 
03:49:08.160 --> 03:49:12.410 align:start position:0%
but have been filled over the last
biennium

03:49:12.410 --> 03:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:14.630 --> 03:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
page 10 is the division of emergency
 
03:49:17.170 --> 03:49:17.180 align:start position:0%
services and Communications
 
03:49:19.729 --> 03:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
the request for
 
03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
division of emergency services and
 
03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
Communications for FY 24 is 18.5 million
 
03:49:27.650 --> 03:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
dollars which is a 5 increase over 23.
 
03:49:30.530 --> 03:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
and for 25 is 18.9 million dollars which
 
03:49:32.450 --> 03:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
is a two percent increase
 
03:49:34.969 --> 03:49:34.979 align:start position:0%
the division has 130 classified and one
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
unclassified employee there are no
 
03:49:40.250 --> 03:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions and no prioritized
 
03:49:40.260 --> 03:49:41.210 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions and no prioritized
needs

03:49:41.210 --> 03:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
needs
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
this is a division that runs the 911
 
03:49:46.370 --> 03:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
system and so in FY 22 the division
 
03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
answered 481 032 911 calls they
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
maintained a 51.64 second transfer time
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
for emergency medical dispatch they
 
03:49:58.969 --> 03:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
achieved 99 quality assurance rate when
 
03:50:00.969 --> 03:50:00.979 align:start position:0%
they were through their reviews of
 
03:50:04.190 --> 03:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
5745 emergency medical dispatch calls
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
no significant changes to salary and
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
benefits in fy24 there is an increase in
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
overtime budgets in both 24 and 25 and
 
03:50:21.170 --> 03:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's to ensure that we're manning the
 
03:50:21.180 --> 03:50:22.330 align:start position:0%
that's to ensure that we're manning the
911

03:50:22.330 --> 03:50:22.340 align:start position:0%
911
 
03:50:25.150 --> 03:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
they're staffed at both peace apps
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that no calls go
 
03:50:28.319 --> 03:50:30.010 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that no calls go
unanswered

03:50:30.010 --> 03:50:30.020 align:start position:0%
unanswered
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
322 000 of the increase in 25 are due to
 
03:50:34.849 --> 03:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
increases in salary and benefits from
 
03:50:36.889 --> 03:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
expected employee increments
 
03:50:38.929 --> 03:50:38.939 align:start position:0%
and one million dollar increase in 24
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
and 25 are due to increases in operating
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
costs in general the majority of those
 
03:50:44.929 --> 03:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
have to do with the licenses and this
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
and the contracts required for ensuring
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
the 911 system is up and running
 
03:50:51.710 --> 03:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
including computer-aided dispatch and
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
automatic location identification
 
03:50:53.640 --> 03:50:59.269 align:start position:0%
automatic location identification
services

03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.250 --> 03:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
page 11 is the division of fire
 
03:51:02.690 --> 03:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
standards and training and Emergency
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
Medical Services
 
03:51:08.450 --> 03:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
the division's request for fy24 is 9.5
 
03:51:11.570 --> 03:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars it's also 9.5 million
 
03:51:14.570 --> 03:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
for fy25 and that's about a 13 increase
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
from FY 23
 
03:51:20.330 --> 03:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
this division has 40 classified and one
 
03:51:23.150 --> 03:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
unclassified position there are three
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded new classified positions that
 
03:51:29.210 --> 03:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
are being requested the majority of this
 
03:51:32.269 --> 03:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
division is instruction is provided by
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
part-timers and so that's one of the
 
03:51:37.190 --> 03:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
well we'll talk about this in a moment
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the prioritized needs but shifting
 
03:51:40.969 --> 03:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
away from the part-time model due to
 
03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
challenges with with finding individuals
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
who are willing to teach those courses
 
03:51:47.389 --> 03:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
and maybe seeing if there's an
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for full-time instructors to
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
help meet the demand for firefighter one
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
and firefighter 2 trainings that are out
 
03:51:53.700 --> 03:51:55.010 align:start position:0%
and firefighter 2 trainings that are out
there

03:51:55.010 --> 03:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:51:59.210 --> 03:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
in FY 22 the division enrolled 20 140
 
03:52:02.330 --> 03:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
students issued 1280 certifications
 
03:52:08.690 --> 03:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
taught 897 courses they conducted 96 991
 
03:52:11.530 --> 03:52:11.540 align:start position:0%
training hours licensed
 
03:52:15.650 --> 03:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
5375 EMS providers and licensed 472
 
03:52:18.910 --> 03:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
ambulances and five rotary Wing
 
03:52:22.190 --> 03:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management I'm sorry emergency
 
03:52:24.130 --> 03:52:24.140 align:start position:0%
response vehicles
 
03:52:26.809 --> 03:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
the summary of significant changes for
 
03:52:29.570 --> 03:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 217
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
000 of the increase in 24 and 182 000 of
 
03:52:35.090 --> 03:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
the increase in 25 are due to increases
 
03:52:36.650 --> 03:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
in salary and benefits including
 
03:52:38.330 --> 03:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
part-time instructors to meet those fire
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
training needs
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
eight hundred and sixty thousand dollars
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the increase are due to increased
 
03:52:45.469 --> 03:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
costs for instructional supplies as we
 
03:52:47.929 --> 03:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
said prices have gone up there's also an
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
equipment replacement need for the new
 
03:52:52.330 --> 03:52:52.340 align:start position:0%
candidate candidate physical ability
 
03:52:55.490 --> 03:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
testing a trailer so the trailer needs
 
03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
to be replaced that we currently have
 
03:52:59.809 --> 03:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
and in prioritized needs we have here a
 
03:53:01.610 --> 03:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
request for three new fire service
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
instructors and as I mentioned this
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be testing out a new model where
 
03:53:07.550 --> 03:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
we'd be looking at full-time instructors
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
instead of part-timers especially when
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
delivering firefighter one and
 
03:53:12.830 --> 03:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
firefighter two trainings those are the
 
03:53:15.530 --> 03:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
trainings that are required firefighter
 
03:53:17.170 --> 03:53:17.180 align:start position:0%
ones to be a full-time
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
firefighter server in New Hampshire
 
03:53:23.090 --> 03:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative uh Bobby Richie Muller
 
03:53:25.490 --> 03:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick question
 
03:53:25.500 --> 03:53:26.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick question
um

03:53:26.570 --> 03:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the fire if the full-time instructors
 
03:53:31.250 --> 03:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
are replacing you know similar training
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
provided by part-timers I'm looking and
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
it seems that all the funded all the
 
03:53:37.610 --> 03:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
funding is new wouldn't we have a
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
matching drop in the uh you know missing
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
wages for the part-timers that used to
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
deliver those classes we we absolutely
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
could so if if
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
if the committee were willing to fund
 
03:53:52.370 --> 03:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know even I would say maybe two of
 
03:53:55.309 --> 03:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
these positions if not all three we
 
03:53:57.889 --> 03:53:57.899 align:start position:0%
could have a corresponding drop in our
 
03:53:59.809 --> 03:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
our part-time money yes would you maybe
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
be able to provide us with those numbers
 
03:54:03.530 --> 03:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
because frankly I would be comfortable
 
03:54:06.110 --> 03:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
supporting the net increase but not the
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
gross increase and then hoping we'll
 
03:54:11.150 --> 03:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
find the you know the cuts later so if
 
03:54:12.769 --> 03:54:12.779 align:start position:0%
you could maybe update this number to
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
give us the net estimate of what may
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
cost after you account for those savings
 
03:54:17.880 --> 03:54:19.070 align:start position:0%
cost after you account for those savings
yeah

03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:54:22.190 --> 03:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
03:54:22.200 --> 03:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
representative

03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:30.650 --> 03:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.050 --> 03:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
you had to ask what's that you had to
 
03:54:33.060 --> 03:54:33.950 align:start position:0%
you had to ask what's that you had to
ask

03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:54:35.570 --> 03:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to make sure it's still
 
03:54:37.130 --> 03:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
the same it is yeah the source of the
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
fire funds are um it's actually driver
 
03:54:41.389 --> 03:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
history records
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
and those are are purchased primarily
 
03:54:45.889 --> 03:54:45.899 align:start position:0%
through insurance agencies but some
 
03:54:45.899 --> 03:54:46.670 align:start position:0%
through insurance agencies but some
other

03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
um some some other entities as well and
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
those funds support the fire fund which
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
supports fire standards and training and
 
03:54:58.370 --> 03:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
EMS and also the division of fire safety
 
03:55:00.290 --> 03:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
which is the Fire Marshal's Office
 
03:55:02.330 --> 03:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we have with the
 
03:55:05.929 --> 03:55:05.939 align:start position:0%
fire Fund in previous biennium have come
 
03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
to head this biennium and so we're
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
required now to fully fund these areas
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
we need to increase fees in the fire
 
03:55:15.170 --> 03:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
fund and you'll see in House Bill 2
 
03:55:17.330 --> 03:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's some language changes to the one
 
03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
fee that's in statute that would provide
 
03:55:22.570 --> 03:55:22.580 align:start position:0%
the commissioner with authority to
 
03:55:25.610 --> 03:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
make fee changes through rule making as
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
opposed through as opposed to statute to
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
allow us to be more flexible when when
 
03:55:32.150 --> 03:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
prices increase
 
03:55:34.490 --> 03:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
what kind of price is it for every
 
03:55:34.500 --> 03:55:36.349 align:start position:0%
what kind of price is it for every
inquiry

03:55:36.349 --> 03:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
03:55:38.210 --> 03:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
I say it again I'm sorry a typical
 
03:55:40.610 --> 03:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
inquiry here's a name here's the person
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
want their driver's records and
 
03:55:44.929 --> 03:55:44.939 align:start position:0%
insurance yeah what would the bill be
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so it varies significantly
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
um it's different for you and I going in
 
03:55:51.950 --> 03:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
and making a request versus a versus an
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
organization so the the organizations
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
would enter into a contract with us
 
03:56:00.110 --> 03:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
there's typically an annual fee upwards
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
of ninety thousand dollars per year and
 
03:56:04.130 --> 03:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
then they pay the per record fee on top
 
03:56:06.469 --> 03:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
of that that depends upon if we're
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
giving them a flat file with X number of
 
03:56:13.010 --> 03:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
Records or the actual record
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
um so it may be it may be several it may
 
03:56:19.010 --> 03:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
be on the sense per record or a dollar
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
per record and maybe up to 15 per record
 
03:56:24.290 --> 03:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
if if you're getting the full record
 
03:56:26.450 --> 03:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
our our
 
03:56:29.330 --> 03:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
budget only works if we increase all of
 
03:56:32.150 --> 03:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
those fees this is not going to be any
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
one particular area everybody requesting
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
this data will have to pay
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
um an increased fee in order to fund
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.189 --> 03:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative Murray can I just double
 
03:56:49.729 --> 03:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
check you train 20 000 firefighters in
 
03:56:52.450 --> 03:56:52.460 align:start position:0%
in a year is that the
 
03:56:56.570 --> 03:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
20 000 students yeah yep that's right
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
hmm twenty thousand students trained a
 
03:57:00.889 --> 03:57:00.899 align:start position:0%
year in the firefighting school that's
 
03:57:02.929 --> 03:57:02.939 align:start position:0%
impressive yeah so not necessarily
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
firefighter one there's there's you know
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's other trainings we have the the
 
03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
ARP with the the airplanes fuselage
 
03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's there oh yeah yeah yep
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah some of those are out of state
 
03:57:17.809 --> 03:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
some of these students could be from out
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
of state some of these students could be
 
03:57:22.969 --> 03:57:22.979 align:start position:0%
um from you know corporate
 
03:57:24.769 --> 03:57:24.779 align:start position:0%
um there's different fee structure
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
depending upon if you're affiliated with
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
a fire department in New Hampshire and
 
03:57:30.889 --> 03:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
if you're not and so those affiliated
 
03:57:32.450 --> 03:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
with the Department of New Hampshire get
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
a discounted course rate those not have
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
to pay full price
 
03:57:39.769 --> 03:57:39.779 align:start position:0%
and we also offer courses up north as
 
03:57:39.779 --> 03:57:40.849 align:start position:0%
and we also offer courses up north as
well

03:57:40.849 --> 03:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:57:43.370 --> 03:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
the Burton Training Academy facility in
 
03:57:43.380 --> 03:57:45.950 align:start position:0%
the Burton Training Academy facility in
Bethlehem

03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:48.290 --> 03:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
the the ray Burton training facility in
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh so then finally the division of fire
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
safety uh on page 12.
 
03:58:06.889 --> 03:58:06.899 align:start position:0%
the request for the division of fire
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
safety which is the office of the fire
 
03:58:12.130 --> 03:58:12.140 align:start position:0%
marshal is 4.9 million dollars and 24
 
03:58:15.469 --> 03:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
and uh just under 5 million dollars in
 
03:58:17.870 --> 03:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
fy25 it's a seven percent increase from
 
03:58:19.610 --> 03:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
FY 23.
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
there are 23 classified and one
 
03:58:24.130 --> 03:58:24.140 align:start position:0%
unclassified full-time position
 
03:58:24.140 --> 03:58:25.689 align:start position:0%
unclassified full-time position
authorized

03:58:25.689 --> 03:58:25.699 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
within the division and there is one
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
unfunded full-time position that's new
 
03:58:33.769 --> 03:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
that we're asking for
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:41.210 --> 03:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
the highlights for fire safety and FY 22
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
they investigated 123 fire related
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
incidents conducted 323 Fire and Life
 
03:58:48.410 --> 03:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
safety inspections
 
03:58:48.420 --> 03:58:49.750 align:start position:0%
safety inspections
conducted

03:58:49.750 --> 03:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
1139 building Plan reviews issued 777
 
03:58:57.290 --> 03:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
modular housing labels and issued 856
 
03:58:59.150 --> 03:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
permits for State University and
 
03:59:01.610 --> 03:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
Community College building projects
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
significant changes for 24 and 25 151
 
03:59:09.650 --> 03:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
000 of the increase in 24 and 235 000 of
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
the increase in 25 are due to increased
 
03:59:13.729 --> 03:59:13.739 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit costs from scheduled
 
03:59:13.739 --> 03:59:14.950 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit costs from scheduled
increments

03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
increments
 
03:59:18.349 --> 03:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
124 000 of the increase in 24 and 25 is
 
03:59:20.030 --> 03:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
required for replacement equipment
 
03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
including replacement vehicles for fire
 
03:59:24.769 --> 03:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
investigators similar to State Police
 
03:59:26.689 --> 03:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
they have the same challenges across the
 
03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
board we couldn't purchase vehicles for
 
03:59:30.290 --> 03:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
a period of time
 
03:59:31.969 --> 03:59:31.979 align:start position:0%
and then we talked a little bit about
 
03:59:33.650 --> 03:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
the fire fund already and and the
 
03:59:35.650 --> 03:59:35.660 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have there
 
03:59:38.150 --> 03:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
the language in House Bill 2 will allow
 
03:59:39.769 --> 03:59:39.779 align:start position:0%
us to move through rulemaking and make
 
03:59:42.170 --> 03:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
those fee adjustments to support the
 
03:59:44.689 --> 03:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
division of of fire safety here without
 
03:59:46.189 --> 03:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
that funding
 
03:59:46.199 --> 03:59:47.269 align:start position:0%
that funding
um

03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
we would need to look at alter uh
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
ulterior funding options and potentially
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
moving to the division to the general
 
03:59:54.120 --> 03:59:55.429 align:start position:0%
moving to the division to the general
fund

03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:59:57.469 --> 03:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
um for the full budget amount but we're
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
confident that those fee increases will
 
04:00:00.830 --> 04:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
will provide the revenue that's
 
04:00:03.729 --> 04:00:03.739 align:start position:0%
necessary representative
 
04:00:06.170 --> 04:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:00:07.790 --> 04:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
taking the questions since we haven't
 
04:00:10.610 --> 04:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
received hb2 would you be kind enough to
 
04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
expand a little on the changes that hb2
 
04:00:16.010 --> 04:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
describes for your uh you know expanded
 
04:00:17.929 --> 04:00:17.939 align:start position:0%
authorized used and revised fee setting
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
Authority because right now I got
 
04:00:21.530 --> 04:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
nothing from there so anything you can
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
give me would be very useful in
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
understanding what we are looking at
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely
 
04:00:28.790 --> 04:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
um if if I may just before we we move in
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
that because that's the next part of the
 
04:00:32.570 --> 04:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
presentation right on the next page
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
um but we we've got the information
 
04:00:34.439 --> 04:00:35.630 align:start position:0%
um but we we've got the information
there

04:00:35.630 --> 04:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:00:37.490 --> 04:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
um there are two
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
new program Assistant two positions that
 
04:00:42.170 --> 04:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
I wanted to talk about first
 
04:00:42.180 --> 04:00:42.769 align:start position:0%
I wanted to talk about first
um

04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:45.229 --> 04:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 also
 
04:00:47.150 --> 04:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
which is all tied into house bill too
 
04:00:49.849 --> 04:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
isn't it um House Bill 2 transfers The
 
04:00:51.889 --> 04:00:51.899 align:start position:0%
Authority for inspecting Healthcare
 
04:00:55.070 --> 04:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
facilities from HHS to the office of the
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
fire marshal
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
um it makes sense because we have
 
04:01:00.290 --> 04:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
building inspectors and we have the
 
04:01:02.689 --> 04:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
expertise to do that work HHS struggled
 
04:01:05.090 --> 04:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
to hire people in those roles so we
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
coordinated with HHS coordinated our
 
04:01:09.410 --> 04:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
budgets they reduced their general fund
 
04:01:11.870 --> 04:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
spend by the amount that we needed to
 
04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
create the positions and increase ours
 
04:01:17.389 --> 04:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
it didn't make it into our budget and so
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's one of the prioritized needs that
 
04:01:21.769 --> 04:01:21.779 align:start position:0%
we have listed that quite frankly I
 
04:01:23.809 --> 04:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
debated maybe putting it on an Errata
 
04:01:25.250 --> 04:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
list and saying oops there's a keying
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
error can we add this but because of the
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
dollar amount I wasn't comfortable doing
 
04:01:31.429 --> 04:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
that so that's listed here that's one
 
04:01:33.170 --> 04:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
that I would certainly ask the committee
 
04:01:35.689 --> 04:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
for to support because it was simply it
 
04:01:37.370 --> 04:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
got lost in the shuffle between the two
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
departments and that but budget impact
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
overall is is zero because we
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
coordinated our our increase with their
 
04:01:44.160 --> 04:01:45.530 align:start position:0%
coordinated our our increase with their
reduction

04:01:45.530 --> 04:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the new program
 
04:01:49.809 --> 04:01:49.819 align:start position:0%
Assistant two position in fire safety
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
this is a position specifically to
 
04:01:54.769 --> 04:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
address 91a requests
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
um the division gets significant volume
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
for 91a requests and it they have to
 
04:02:02.570 --> 04:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
meet them but it's a challenge because
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
they also have to respond to fires and
 
04:02:05.929 --> 04:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
conduct their investigations timely
 
04:02:09.410 --> 04:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
they're not able to to do everything and
 
04:02:11.090 --> 04:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
so this position would be focused just
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
on meeting those 91a requests on a
 
04:02:16.969 --> 04:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
so representative moving on the next two
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
pages are House Bill 2 summary items
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
um and um you know this is not the exact
 
04:02:28.370 --> 04:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
language but it's uh for your
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
consideration uh it's worth us talking
 
04:02:33.650 --> 04:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
about each one of these so
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
um the body worn and dashboard camera
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
fund uh this appropriates additional
 
04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
Monies to the the body warm and
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
dashboard cam Camera Fun
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
this was established
 
04:02:44.279 --> 04:02:45.170 align:start position:0%
this was established
um

04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:47.210 --> 04:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
previously I believe it was in House
 
04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh established by House Bill 2
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
the last biennium and additional funds
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
were appropriated in the last
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
legislative session so 2 million had
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
been appropriated to date we've awarded
 
04:03:01.490 --> 04:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
1.1 to 4.48 municipalities and we're on
 
04:03:03.290 --> 04:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
a rolling basis as far as making these
 
04:03:05.450 --> 04:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
funds available this would appropriate
 
04:03:07.610 --> 04:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
another million dollars to that to that
 
04:03:07.620 --> 04:03:09.010 align:start position:0%
another million dollars to that to that
fund

04:03:09.010 --> 04:03:09.020 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:03:11.570 --> 04:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
there's a new northern border Alliance
 
04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
program which would include an
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 1.4 million dollars and
 
04:03:19.250 --> 04:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
this would be to make grants available
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
to other state County local law
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and provide
 
04:03:23.399 --> 04:03:24.830 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and provide
division

04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
um funding to State Police for
 
04:03:30.170 --> 04:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
additional patrols along the northern
 
04:03:33.290 --> 04:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
border to ensure that there's no illicit
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
activity that's happening in that area
 
04:03:37.969 --> 04:03:37.979 align:start position:0%
this helps to supplement some of the
 
04:03:39.530 --> 04:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
federal funding program that we've had
 
04:03:41.450 --> 04:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
in the past but we've seen reductions in
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
those funds and so this addresses that
 
04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
particular need
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
04:03:48.120 --> 04:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
there's also
um

04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
an adjustment to the statute that
 
04:03:54.050 --> 04:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
authorizes the auxiliary State Police
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
right now that statute caps the number
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
of part-time Troopers that we can hire
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
at 16.
 
04:04:04.969 --> 04:04:04.979 align:start position:0%
if this would eliminate that cap just
 
04:04:07.490 --> 04:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
authorize us to hire auxiliary Troopers
 
04:04:10.250 --> 04:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
the limiting factor will be our budget
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
so class 50 is our budget for part-time
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
funding we'll limit how many part-time
 
04:04:19.010 --> 04:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
Troopers we can purchase we can purchase
 
04:04:21.650 --> 04:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
we can hire
 
04:04:21.660 --> 04:04:23.389 align:start position:0%
we can hire
uh

04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:27.050 --> 04:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
the next two uh have to do with the fire
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
fund fees that we talked about
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
copies of certificates and Motor Vehicle
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
Record fees this would eliminate the
 
04:04:36.650 --> 04:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
fees that are currently specifically
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
identified in statute and allow the
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
department to go through rulemaking to
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
set the fees instead
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
and then expansion of the uh
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the of the entities who are able to
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
utilize those fees
 
04:04:54.239 --> 04:04:55.189 align:start position:0%
utilize those fees
um

04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:57.170 --> 04:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
right now we're prohibited from
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
providing driver history records to a
 
04:05:00.610 --> 04:05:00.620 align:start position:0%
federal entity
 
04:05:03.950 --> 04:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
entirely this would allow us to do so
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
but only for the same usage purposes as
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
a as a corporate entity would be allowed
 
04:05:11.090 --> 04:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
for so there's still restrictions on
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
that data not building databases and
 
04:05:16.250 --> 04:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
things of that nature but they'd have
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
the same usage as an insurance company
 
04:05:20.210 --> 04:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
and have have the ability to obtain that
 
04:05:20.220 --> 04:05:22.130 align:start position:0%
and have have the ability to obtain that
information

04:05:22.130 --> 04:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:05:24.050 --> 04:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
the residential care and health facility
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
inspection this is related to those two
 
04:05:27.290 --> 04:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
positions that we just spoke about
 
04:05:30.110 --> 04:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
transferring that function from HHS over
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then there is a new division of fire
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
safety position this is a program
 
04:05:39.050 --> 04:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
Assistant two
 
04:05:41.210 --> 04:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
um to manage building and fire code
 
04:05:43.429 --> 04:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
amendment process
 
04:05:45.170 --> 04:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
um this was another piece that was
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
missed in in Senate Bill 443 uh during
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
the 22 legislative session
 
04:05:53.330 --> 04:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
we shared that we needed this position
 
04:05:56.090 --> 04:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
to um to manage these amendments and
 
04:05:57.769 --> 04:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're being processed
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
correctly for whatever reason it wasn't
 
04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
added to the statute and we were told to
 
04:06:05.469 --> 04:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
go through the budget process instead so
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.439 --> 04:06:11.710 align:start position:0%
 
page

04:06:11.710 --> 04:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:06:15.410 --> 04:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
14. this is authorization allowing the
 
04:06:17.809 --> 04:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
department to fill unfunded positions as
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
long as our expenditures don't exceed
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
the total appropriated amount
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
so if we do still have unfunded
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
positions at the end of this process
 
04:06:28.969 --> 04:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
this allows us through vacancies to fund
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
those throughout the year if we're able
 
04:06:30.899 --> 04:06:32.450 align:start position:0%
those throughout the year if we're able
to

04:06:32.450 --> 04:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:06:34.809 --> 04:06:34.819 align:start position:0%
the substance abuse enforcement program
 
04:06:38.769 --> 04:06:38.779 align:start position:0%
this is also known as Granite Shield
 
04:06:42.849 --> 04:06:42.859 align:start position:0%
this uh this program is focused on
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
reducing narcotics inflows into the
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
state and this appropriates appropriates
 
04:06:52.729 --> 04:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
408 000 in general funds to safety for
 
04:06:55.250 --> 04:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
overtime for forensic laboratory and
 
04:06:57.170 --> 04:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
State Police over time related to the
 
04:07:00.889 --> 04:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
program and also 1.6 million in funds to
 
04:07:03.170 --> 04:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
award to local and county law
 
04:07:05.150 --> 04:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies for overtime costs
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
04:07:08.809 --> 04:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
um focused on these law enforcement
 
04:07:08.819 --> 04:07:11.090 align:start position:0%
um focused on these law enforcement
activities

04:07:11.090 --> 04:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
activities
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
emergency medical and Trauma services so
 
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
there's some statutory changes that are
 
04:07:19.490 --> 04:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
made related to naloxone and also
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
defining peer support groups
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
to to
 
04:07:27.769 --> 04:07:27.779 align:start position:0%
allow more individuals to administer
 
04:07:30.610 --> 04:07:30.620 align:start position:0%
naloxone without fear of any sort of
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
ramification so similar to an AED device
 
04:07:36.889 --> 04:07:36.899 align:start position:0%
if somebody's having a heart attack kind
 
04:07:38.150 --> 04:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
of following that model so that's what
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
those do there
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
there's language here to just suspend
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
rsa99 this is the RSA that limits the
 
04:07:49.849 --> 04:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
percentage of Highway and um
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
Casa collections funds to 26 percent of
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
the total revenue that's collected
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
um if you recall there's a fund balance
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the highway fund and part of that is
 
04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
from General funds that were added in
 
04:08:03.769 --> 04:08:03.779 align:start position:0%
the previous biennium and so that 26
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
percent will likely be
 
04:08:06.000 --> 04:08:07.370 align:start position:0%
percent will likely be
um

04:08:07.370 --> 04:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
likely be over that 26 percent but it's
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
because there's a fund balance that
 
04:08:15.610 --> 04:08:15.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you that
 
04:08:20.330 --> 04:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
won't hurt any of our matching monies
 
04:08:24.670 --> 04:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
no I don't believe so okay
 
04:08:27.600 --> 04:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
no I don't believe so okay
um

04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to make sure it
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
should okay thank you representative
 
04:08:36.769 --> 04:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
Weiler explain how what what figures
 
04:08:40.490 --> 04:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
you're using to do the 26 percent
 
04:08:42.050 --> 04:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
um so it's the
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh collected from it's it's
 
04:08:47.330 --> 04:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
whatever was in in the statute which I'm
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
going from memory so
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
um well that was that was mine from
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
about 15 years ago okay so it's the re
 
04:08:55.729 --> 04:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
the revenues that are collected
 
04:08:57.650 --> 04:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
um and then it's the total Highway fund
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh Appropriations and cost of
 
04:09:02.210 --> 04:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
collections Appropriations
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so it would be 25 26 in total and I
 
04:09:07.969 --> 04:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
kind of defer to Mickey two on this as
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
well yeah I'll make sure that the budget
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
is either in compliance or a suspension
 
04:09:15.410 --> 04:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
is included in House Bill 2 that law did
 
04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
change maybe three budgets ago now to
 
04:09:19.729 --> 04:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
include gross motor vehicle and road
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
tolls so one thing Steve may or may not
 
04:09:23.450 --> 04:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
have included is
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
um if you recall a DOT came in the
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
betterment account is restricted and the
 
04:09:31.370 --> 04:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 367 that 4.2 Cent gas tax is
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
those are not part of unrestricted but
 
04:09:35.809 --> 04:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
they are part of the Gross Road toll
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
collection and all of those dollars are
 
04:09:40.370 --> 04:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
appropriated to dot so I think when you
 
04:09:42.410 --> 04:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
factor in those programs and include
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
those as part of gross motor vehicle and
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
road toll collections will will probably
 
04:09:48.170 --> 04:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
be compliant but we'll monitor that as
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
division two makes is thank you thank
 
04:09:50.880 --> 04:09:52.370 align:start position:0%
division two makes is thank you thank
you

04:09:52.370 --> 04:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:09:54.170 --> 04:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
the key here was we wanted to we were
 
04:09:55.849 --> 04:09:55.859 align:start position:0%
aware of this and we wanted to make sure
 
04:09:55.859 --> 04:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
aware of this and we wanted to make sure
that

04:09:57.110 --> 04:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:59.210 --> 04:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
um if we weren't compliant it was
 
04:09:59.220 --> 04:10:01.370 align:start position:0%
um if we weren't compliant it was
addressed

04:10:01.370 --> 04:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
state and local cyber security grant
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
program so
 
04:10:05.399 --> 04:10:06.769 align:start position:0%
program so
um

04:10:06.769 --> 04:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Petri this is the the
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
matching funds we talked about earlier
 
04:10:13.969 --> 04:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
about uh to support the federal FEMA
 
04:10:13.979 --> 04:10:15.170 align:start position:0%
about uh to support the federal FEMA
money

04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
um this is the state share of those
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
funds which will help to improve state
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
and local cyber security
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then finally the state police
 
04:10:26.210 --> 04:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
cruiser appropriation 3.5 million for 52
 
04:10:29.090 --> 04:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
Cruisers which will help us get to a
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
healthy Fleet and to a level that we can
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
maintain over the future biennium and
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
not run into the the backlog of
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
purchases that we're trying to work
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
through right now
 
04:10:41.330 --> 04:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller thank you Mr
 
04:10:41.340 --> 04:10:42.349 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller thank you Mr
chair

04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
I completely understand the need to get
 
04:10:47.210 --> 04:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
the vehicles but then I'm trying to look
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
down six years or whatever down the road
 
04:10:51.769 --> 04:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
and I don't want our you know vehicle
 
04:10:53.570 --> 04:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
replacement program to look like a
 
04:10:56.689 --> 04:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
python with a big you know egg in it you
 
04:10:59.229 --> 04:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
know basically is there any way to
 
04:11:01.849 --> 04:11:01.859 align:start position:0%
massage your Fleet replacement services
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
so we can flatten and you know make this
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
a bit more uh even over the long term I
 
04:11:08.929 --> 04:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
understand it may be hard to do it at
 
04:11:10.910 --> 04:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
once because you have 52 vehicles coming
 
04:11:13.370 --> 04:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
in but I would just appreciate any
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
comments on how you plan to handle that
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
sure and I want to say we try to be as
 
04:11:20.450 --> 04:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
conservative but yet accurate as
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
possible than anything we ask for I will
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
say this is um critical for the State
 
04:11:28.250 --> 04:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
Police these 52 and then if we can
 
04:11:31.370 --> 04:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
acquire those moving forward we go back
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
to our vehicle replacement plan which we
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
look at you know the miles I mean they
 
04:11:37.969 --> 04:11:37.979 align:start position:0%
are when I when I say keeping vehicles
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the road that we have never you know
 
04:11:44.570 --> 04:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
kept them to that extent in the past so
 
04:11:46.849 --> 04:11:46.859 align:start position:0%
my question was strictly my question was
 
04:11:48.830 --> 04:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
strictly about the replacement I'm not
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about your need I just you
 
04:11:53.150 --> 04:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
know am trying to figure out if there is
 
04:11:55.370 --> 04:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
a way to maybe play with their lives a
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
little so that we spread The
 
04:11:58.849 --> 04:11:58.859 align:start position:0%
Replacements across a few budget Cycles
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
to not have a huge cost coming again in
 
04:12:02.809 --> 04:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
whatever years when we need to replace
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
them all at once that's that's all there
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
is to it yeah that's
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's what these purchases in this in
 
04:12:12.410 --> 04:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
the next biennium will allow us to do
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
um we are we are so far in the other
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
direction that this will this will right
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
size us and allow us to have steady
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
requests for replacement over the next
 
04:12:25.610 --> 04:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
several biennium and the other thing is
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
as we fill these positions it becomes
 
04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
more of an issue so when you have the
 
04:12:32.210 --> 04:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
vacancies it's not as much but so it
 
04:12:37.070 --> 04:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you can you
 
04:12:41.630 --> 04:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
go back to the state and local cyber
 
04:12:44.809 --> 04:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
security the grant program this enables
 
04:12:48.530 --> 04:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
us to get federal funds is that right
 
04:12:52.010 --> 04:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
um do we have those federal funds now
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's so isn't this
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
why would this not have been included in
 
04:12:59.450 --> 04:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
the budget if it's important for us to
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
get this matching money from Federal
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's all it's all happened
 
04:13:05.040 --> 04:13:06.530 align:start position:0%
it's it's all it's all happened
quickly

04:13:06.530 --> 04:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
um and outside of the budget process
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
within the last
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
six months um we so we just brought an
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
item to fiscal
 
04:13:18.050 --> 04:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
um this last meeting and to GNC to
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate the federal award
 
04:13:23.330 --> 04:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and so we didn't know that whether we
 
04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
would get the award or not and
 
04:13:27.769 --> 04:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
um that that's why it wasn't included in
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
the operating budget per se
 
04:13:32.150 --> 04:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
so do I so I understand so this is
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
something presumably I could presume
 
04:13:35.450 --> 04:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
that this would have been included in
 
04:13:37.130 --> 04:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
the budget had you known about it in
 
04:13:37.140 --> 04:13:37.969 align:start position:0%
the budget had you known about it in
time

04:13:37.969 --> 04:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:13:39.650 --> 04:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
if we had already received the federal
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
award the okay then we would have been
 
04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
able to take a different a different
 
04:13:50.210 --> 04:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.330 --> 04:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
question on your substance abuse
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
of course we have neighbors at all have
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
legalize marijuana how much of a problem
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
is that you know in
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
I mean you know it when it's legal on
 
04:14:03.889 --> 04:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
the other side I mean it's it's going to
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
come to our side of the border and uh
 
04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
that would seem like uh it's it'd be a
 
04:14:13.370 --> 04:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
hard enforcement uh I mean do you what's
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
it called I mean the cost of that is
 
04:14:17.689 --> 04:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
well I just I mean
 
04:14:19.849 --> 04:14:19.859 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement Falls the law they
 
04:14:21.530 --> 04:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
adhere to it you know no matter what the
 
04:14:23.210 --> 04:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
border states are doing but one of the
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
areas with with the marijuana that we've
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
been focusing on as I know uh the office
 
04:14:29.809 --> 04:14:29.819 align:start position:0%
of Highway Safety is trying to prepare
 
04:14:32.689 --> 04:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
for any increases and you know drivers
 
04:14:34.490 --> 04:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
that could be impaired by marijuana so
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that we're being aware
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
of it you know on the on the street you
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
know when an officer comes in contact
 
04:14:43.010 --> 04:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
with anyone I think they they're trained
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
they know how to deal with you know what
 
04:14:47.090 --> 04:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
is what is a violation what's you know
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
what's a felony
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
um but I think the future that they're
 
04:14:54.410 --> 04:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
wise they're focusing on our Dre program
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
and how do we address those that might
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
be impaired by um by drugs as opposed to
 
04:15:00.239 --> 04:15:04.550 align:start position:0%
be impaired by um by drugs as opposed to
alcohol

04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray can I follow up
 
04:15:08.809 --> 04:15:08.819 align:start position:0%
on that in terms of costs and this may
 
04:15:11.809 --> 04:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
be impossible to answer if marijuana
 
04:15:13.490 --> 04:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
becomes legal
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
what would effect that have on you on
 
04:15:18.170 --> 04:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
um criminal justice or you know what
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
police the state police can do
 
04:15:23.330 --> 04:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
um is anyone arresting someone for
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
marijuana now since it's been
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
decriminalized what would be the
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
difference it becomes legal are you
 
04:15:31.250 --> 04:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
doing spending money now because it's
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
not legal would you be spending money
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
more later on if it is legal can you
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
give some sort of a scenario or
 
04:15:39.290 --> 04:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
narrative about what the changes would
 
04:15:40.969 --> 04:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
be for law enforcement if it became
 
04:15:40.979 --> 04:15:42.710 align:start position:0%
be for law enforcement if it became
legal

04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
legal
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
that that that's a complex question and
 
04:15:47.330 --> 04:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
I guess the the simple answer is we
 
04:15:49.490 --> 04:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
would um we would follow the Law
 
04:15:51.710 --> 04:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
whatever the you know the policy leaders
 
04:15:53.450 --> 04:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
whatever the law was
 
04:15:57.410 --> 04:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
um yeah so yeah alcohol is legal so you
 
04:16:00.050 --> 04:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
get it arrested for over indulging so
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
even if cannabis is legal you're going
 
04:16:05.210 --> 04:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
to get arrested for misuse but I'm right
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
now you're you could be arrested for a
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
use not just necessarily misuse so I'm
 
04:16:11.809 --> 04:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
wondering the difference I think it's a
 
04:16:13.130 --> 04:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
great question and it comes back to
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
training so whatever let's say you know
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
whatever laws were passed if it had to
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
do with weights or amounts or whether
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's possessing or transporting I mean
 
04:16:23.090 --> 04:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
obviously if you're impaired you're
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
impaired no matter what the substance is
 
04:16:27.170 --> 04:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
um I can't put a cost on it we always
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
look at the lab you know I can say that
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
our backlog in the lab has gone down
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
significantly since recent changes so
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
they've been able to focus on more
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous drugs like the Fentanyl and
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
heroin and cocaine but it will all come
 
04:16:46.969 --> 04:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
down to training and that's really the
 
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
the job of you know of the Chiefs and
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
the police academy and the leaders so
 
04:16:55.309 --> 04:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
um so I think the key is to just uh and
 
04:16:56.570 --> 04:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's that's with anything in law
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement whatever changes are out of
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
the law so but again the the we're
 
04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
focused on the on the highway safety
 
04:17:04.849 --> 04:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
component of it now and and we have been
 
04:17:07.010 --> 04:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
as we've been seeing you know what's
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
happened along the borders
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Buco do you have a
 
04:17:10.020 --> 04:17:11.330 align:start position:0%
representative Buco do you have a
question

04:17:11.330 --> 04:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
um back where it says uh
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
in hospital 2
 
04:17:20.269 --> 04:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
um the change in a change in the law to
 
04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
allow Department of Safety to set the
 
04:17:22.260 --> 04:17:23.929 align:start position:0%
allow Department of Safety to set the
fees

04:17:23.929 --> 04:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
fees
 
04:17:27.650 --> 04:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
from to promote a record motor records
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is what what fees
 
04:17:34.429 --> 04:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.439 --> 04:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
yeah so those are the uh those are motor
 
04:17:41.450 --> 04:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
vehicle driving driving history records
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and those are made available to
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
um certain uh
 
04:17:50.150 --> 04:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
certain entities by law who have access
 
04:17:53.150 --> 04:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
to those for a fee and so right now the
 
04:17:56.689 --> 04:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
fee for those those records
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
um is set in statute specifically in the
 
04:18:01.370 --> 04:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount I believe it I believe
 
04:18:05.950 --> 04:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's 13 uh per record and 13 and 15
 
04:18:08.689 --> 04:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
depending upon if it's the individual
 
04:18:11.809 --> 04:18:11.819 align:start position:0%
record or the large group record and so
 
04:18:13.729 --> 04:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
we would eliminate that fee from the
 
04:18:13.739 --> 04:18:14.929 align:start position:0%
we would eliminate that fee from the
statute

04:18:14.929 --> 04:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
but require the department to go to jail
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
car to establish the fee moving forward
 
04:18:22.729 --> 04:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
which gives us the ability to make
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
adjustments as we need to when prices
 
04:18:25.439 --> 04:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
adjustments as we need to when prices
increase

04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:18:30.530 --> 04:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you um one one
 
04:18:32.450 --> 04:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up back back here somewhere said
 
04:18:34.969 --> 04:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
that we had five rotary
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
rotary Wing aircraft
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that would be for dark correct
 
04:18:44.150 --> 04:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's a Lifeline well we have we have
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
five of them no we don't we don't own
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
those well okay that was my question
 
04:18:51.170 --> 04:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you what the ambulances yeah thank
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah yeah representative uh Mueller
 
04:18:57.530 --> 04:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Richard just to continue
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
building a little on the whole impact of
 
04:19:01.689 --> 04:19:01.699 align:start position:0%
possible legalization of marijuana
 
04:19:04.490 --> 04:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a complex topic and Way
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
Beyond this afternoon but
 
04:19:09.769 --> 04:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
while it may
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
require a bit more work in terms of road
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
safety assuming High utilization and
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
therefore higher abuse area
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
what would you say just at a very high
 
04:19:20.929 --> 04:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
level for the entire department of
 
04:19:22.969 --> 04:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
safety would you expect that to make you
 
04:19:22.979 --> 04:19:24.469 align:start position:0%
safety would you expect that to make you
know

04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
to be more of a burden in terms of more
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
work or decrease your burden a little in
 
04:19:30.889 --> 04:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
terms of just expenses and Staffing and
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
do you expect less or more work if that
 
04:19:35.150 --> 04:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
happens overall at the state level and I
 
04:19:36.769 --> 04:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
know it's not really a fair question
 
04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
just curious if you have a you know
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.050 --> 04:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
again I would just say this I think we
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
would all agree if we saw an increase in
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
crashes if we saw an increase in fatal
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
crashes loss of life if we saw an
 
04:19:55.010 --> 04:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
increase in calls for service if you saw
 
04:19:57.170 --> 04:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
that you would see you would see
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
increases but again I can't predict
 
04:20:03.650 --> 04:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
um but um you know just just focusing on
 
04:20:05.630 --> 04:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I think what's you know near dear to
 
04:20:07.130 --> 04:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
everyone it's just being safe when
 
04:20:08.809 --> 04:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
you're on the road and so that's really
 
04:20:11.330 --> 04:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
where a lot of our conversations have
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
come around we just recently
 
04:20:18.050 --> 04:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
had an item to expand to uh tests oral
 
04:20:21.170 --> 04:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
fluid for to see on impairment like we
 
04:20:22.969 --> 04:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
have the portable breath test to see if
 
04:20:24.889 --> 04:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
somebody roadside has been consuming
 
04:20:28.010 --> 04:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
alcohol I think they these machines text
 
04:20:31.010 --> 04:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
test for six drug classes so you know
 
04:20:32.150 --> 04:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking
 
04:20:34.250 --> 04:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to stay current and so
 
04:20:36.290 --> 04:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's that's really where a lot of the
 
04:20:43.010 --> 04:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
so um if we could now move to you have
 
04:20:50.090 --> 04:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
um the first is the multi-page document
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
and this is a list of this summarizes
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs that we spoke
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
about in the presentation but it puts
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
them in priority order because again we
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
we presented at the division level you
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
had division priorities this is
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
Department level priorities so I just
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
want to take a moment to walk through
 
04:21:15.290 --> 04:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
these quickly just to make sure that the
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee that if you have any questions
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
on any of these we're happy to address
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
them so the first are the two new
 
04:21:23.389 --> 04:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
full-time program Specialists three
 
04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
positions for the health care facility
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
inspection function that I mentioned was
 
04:21:30.769 --> 04:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
really something that just got missed in
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
in the budget so
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
um we would we would hope that that was
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
something that we could add in at this
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
phase the next are four existing data
 
04:21:43.130 --> 04:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
control clerk positions at the DMV and
 
04:21:45.290 --> 04:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
these are the ones that process driving
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
history records and make sure those are
 
04:21:50.210 --> 04:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
up to date the third priority is the
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
existing program specialist one an
 
04:21:53.689 --> 04:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
existing program specialist two
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
positions in homeland security and those
 
04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
are ensuring that the Homeland function
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
are occurring on a regular basis
 
04:22:04.330 --> 04:22:04.340 align:start position:0%
well quick question about that formally
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
we very rarely saw any general funds for
 
04:22:11.689 --> 04:22:11.699 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and now we are
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.760 --> 04:22:16.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's there's not there shouldn't be a
 
04:22:20.809 --> 04:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
lot of General functions in your chart
 
04:22:23.150 --> 04:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot yeah it's about 43
 
04:22:27.650 --> 04:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
million uh 43 000 I think yep so um so
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
there's always been some general funds
 
04:22:44.570 --> 04:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
in homeland security the directors uh
 
04:22:46.490 --> 04:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
position itself has always been funded
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
with General funds um and there's always
 
04:22:50.929 --> 04:22:50.939 align:start position:0%
been a small piece that's attached we've
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
tried to keep that as low as possible
 
04:22:55.130 --> 04:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
but there's always been some so all of
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
these are we're looking for
 
04:22:58.370 --> 04:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
authorization for these positions
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
using the dollars the federal dollars
 
04:23:06.309 --> 04:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
so it may be a misunderstanding you
 
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
the funding for for these for the
 
04:23:11.150 --> 04:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
existing positions what you're asking
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
for yes it's a mix um so it's Federal
 
04:23:16.010 --> 04:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
private local in general so that's the
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
mix that's in the accounting unit yeah
 
04:23:19.130 --> 04:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
so in this particular case even though
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're asking for 156
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
000 the general fund to ask is only 54
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
000. thank you yes sorry I understand
 
04:23:30.410 --> 04:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
yep representative Murray thank you in
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
the same vein it looks like with
 
04:23:33.889 --> 04:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security you're asking for two
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
additional positions
 
04:23:39.050 --> 04:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
in the budget it looked to me like there
 
04:23:41.570 --> 04:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
are four additional positions so
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere I'm missing two
 
04:23:45.170 --> 04:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
so I haven't gone through this very
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
detailed but it struck out it stood out
 
04:23:50.809 --> 04:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
at me this I'm on page 429 of the budget
 
04:23:52.849 --> 04:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
yeah under the homeland security okay
 
04:23:55.570 --> 04:23:55.580 align:start position:0%
and at the bottom they're
 
04:23:58.729 --> 04:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
223 there are two positions in 24 there
 
04:24:01.370 --> 04:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure I've just missed something
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
up here this is in um I think I think I
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
know what this is give me a second
 
04:24:15.410 --> 04:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
before 29 I can't find the other numbers
 
04:24:19.130 --> 04:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
fast enough yeah so go from two to six
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
so so those are that changes because of
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
four full-time temporary positions that
 
04:24:30.889 --> 04:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
were converted into full-time
 
04:24:33.290 --> 04:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
um permanent positions so they were they
 
04:24:34.969 --> 04:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
were funded
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
um through additional Federal monies
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
outside of the budget process through
 
04:24:42.050 --> 04:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal through GNC and we need those
 
04:24:43.849 --> 04:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
positions and are making them permanent
 
04:24:45.650 --> 04:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
so there are not new positions they're
 
04:24:49.370 --> 04:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
redefined positions thank you yes
 
04:24:49.380 --> 04:24:57.070 align:start position:0%
redefined positions thank you yes
foreign

04:24:57.070 --> 04:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.010 --> 04:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
so page two of the prioritized needs
 
04:25:01.020 --> 04:25:02.150 align:start position:0%
so page two of the prioritized needs
listing

04:25:02.150 --> 04:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
listing
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
um is the
 
04:25:06.050 --> 04:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
three criminalist positions within the
 
04:25:06.060 --> 04:25:07.010 align:start position:0%
three criminalist positions within the
lab

04:25:07.010 --> 04:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
lab
 
04:25:08.689 --> 04:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
so again those are supporting the
 
04:25:10.969 --> 04:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
forensic biology section and then also
 
04:25:10.979 --> 04:25:12.950 align:start position:0%
forensic biology section and then also
toxicology

04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
toxicology
 
04:25:15.229 --> 04:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
our fifth priority is the new program
 
04:25:16.969 --> 04:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
specialist two position in the digital
 
04:25:19.130 --> 04:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
evidence unit in State Police to support
 
04:25:21.170 --> 04:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
the body and Cruiser camera program and
 
04:25:23.769 --> 04:25:23.779 align:start position:0%
making sure that those requests are are
 
04:25:27.889 --> 04:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
processed timely for Discovery requests
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
number six is a new position in Human
 
04:25:32.210 --> 04:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
Resources the human resources
 
04:25:35.090 --> 04:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
coordinator 2 to ensure that we're
 
04:25:36.889 --> 04:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
processing all transactions timely that
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:42.649 --> 04:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
number seven
 
04:25:42.659 --> 04:25:46.130 align:start position:0%
number seven
is

04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
the increase in credit card fees at the
 
04:25:48.300 --> 04:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
the increase in credit card fees at the
DMV

04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
DMV
 
04:25:51.889 --> 04:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
and based on some of the reaction it
 
04:25:53.450 --> 04:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
sounds like we should probably consider
 
04:25:55.849 --> 04:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
the convenience fee option
 
04:25:55.859 --> 04:25:56.510 align:start position:0%
the convenience fee option
um

04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:58.729 --> 04:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
number eight is fire standards and
 
04:26:01.250 --> 04:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
training admin these are the new uh fire
 
04:26:03.290 --> 04:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
safety instructors the full-timers as
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to the part-timers so we'll
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
we'll come back with the reduction in
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
part-time money to see if we can
 
04:26:09.479 --> 04:26:10.189 align:start position:0%
part-time money to see if we can
um

04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
absorb some of those by reducing
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
part-timers and give that option to the
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
committee number nine is the new program
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
assistant position in the Fire Marshal's
 
04:26:22.370 --> 04:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
Office to address 91a requests
 
04:26:25.130 --> 04:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
and then number 10 are the
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
um security enhancements at the DMVs
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's adding the glass and then also
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
the security monitors for the high
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:37.610 --> 04:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
number 11 is adding a DMV station to
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
Plymouth which helps to improve customer
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
service at Concord and Tamworth and
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
address the demands in The Lakes Region
 
04:26:43.800 --> 04:26:44.990 align:start position:0%
address the demands in The Lakes Region
area

04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
and then 12
 
04:26:48.769 --> 04:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
which are split up into a b and c
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
because of the accounting units these
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
are the 17 previously unfunded Trooper
 
04:26:54.410 --> 04:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
positions so funding these would allow
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
us to increase Patrol Services across
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
the state in addition to maintaining
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
so that's the prioritized list of our
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
04:27:09.769 --> 04:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
and then the one page item similar setup
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
these are a rata adjustments that we're
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
um this is these are adjustments that we
 
04:27:17.330 --> 04:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
intended to include in the budget but
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason they were not so the
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
first is transferring positions between
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
um within the division of emergency
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
services and Communications between the
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
Bureau of communications and the
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
communications section itself this is
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
budget neutral it's shifting positions
 
04:27:33.889 --> 04:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
to where they they should be paid out of
 
04:27:37.130 --> 04:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
no impact on the funding the second is a
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
similar situation it's transferring
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
positions between two accounting units
 
04:27:42.530 --> 04:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
in Motor Vehicles because of where
 
04:27:44.330 --> 04:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're doing the work now it's all cost
 
04:27:46.490 --> 04:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
of collection zero budget impact
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
the third is a revenue Source correction
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
of three thousand dollars in DMV there's
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
some general funds that are incorrectly
 
04:27:58.250 --> 04:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
coded those should be agency income so
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
we'll reduce General funds by three
 
04:28:01.689 --> 04:28:01.699 align:start position:0%
thousand seven dollars
 
04:28:05.090 --> 04:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
and then the fourth is to appropriate
 
04:28:06.769 --> 04:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
thirty seven thousand dollars in other
 
04:28:08.450 --> 04:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
funds for
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
um 911 cyber security Consulting so this
 
04:28:14.090 --> 04:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
was a key this was missed during keying
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
um it's 37 000 because of that it was
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
included in the Errata listing as
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:22.800 --> 04:28:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:28:27.469 --> 04:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
that really concludes the presentation
 
04:28:29.330 --> 04:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
that we have for you today
 
04:28:32.330 --> 04:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
04:28:35.090 --> 04:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
um I would like to move that we accept
 
04:28:35.100 --> 04:28:36.649 align:start position:0%
um I would like to move that we accept
the

04:28:36.649 --> 04:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:36.659 --> 04:28:37.550 align:start position:0%
the
um

04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:40.130 --> 04:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
changes that you just gave us the
 
04:28:40.140 --> 04:28:42.050 align:start position:0%
changes that you just gave us the
corrections

04:28:42.050 --> 04:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:28:44.450 --> 04:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
um as one of the activities that we need
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
to take care of Mickey am I okay doing

power safety
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
can I sure
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
this is a really good presentation
 
04:29:45.050 --> 04:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
everything was very very clear and I
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate the amount of work you put
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
into this because this is probably one
 
04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
of the more concise and comprehensive
 
04:29:53.210 --> 04:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
presentations that we've seen
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:19.870 --> 04:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
he brought his assistant
 
04:30:25.990 --> 04:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right
 
04:30:29.220 --> 04:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right
yeah

04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
so one of the bills that we've retained
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 560 relative to the uh
 
04:30:39.170 --> 04:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
contact person notification program I
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if anyone wanted to ask the
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
department about that bill I know we had
 
04:30:43.969 --> 04:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
questions when we had our brief work
 
04:30:43.979 --> 04:30:51.849 align:start position:0%
questions when we had our brief work
session

04:30:51.849 --> 04:30:51.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's the bill that um would create a
 
04:30:58.010 --> 04:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
list for individuals who
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
um may not be competent to speak on
 
04:31:03.050 --> 04:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
their own behalf right and so then if
 
04:31:04.729 --> 04:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
they were pulled over State Police would
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
be able to it's a contact person
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
notification program for that situation
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes yeah the main question was if my you
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
know not actually but my Looney husband
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
goes off on his own and he's pulled
 
04:31:19.309 --> 04:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere and he doesn't have any
 
04:31:20.929 --> 04:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
information on him he's just this person
 
04:31:23.809 --> 04:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
on the side of the road having me as his
 
04:31:25.849 --> 04:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
emergency contact isn't helpful unless
 
04:31:28.729 --> 04:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
you can attach me to him in some way so
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
how do if you know if this is this past
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
the question was how do you how does the
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
officer get the contact information for
 
04:31:37.849 --> 04:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
the person who is without
 
04:31:40.490 --> 04:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know identification and maybe you
 
04:31:42.889 --> 04:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
know without some reason at that point
 
04:31:44.809 --> 04:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
do you see what I'm saying you can have
 
04:31:46.729 --> 04:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
a big list of emergency contacts but if
 
04:31:48.889 --> 04:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
you can't attach those contacts to an
 
04:31:52.010 --> 04:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
unidentified person what good does it do
 
04:31:54.969 --> 04:31:54.979 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would have to be tied into
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
one of the one of one of the searches
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
that the Troopers utilize when they're
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
um pulling someone when they look
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
someone up so it seems to me it's tied
 
04:32:07.389 --> 04:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
into the DMV system more than anything
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
would there what would there be that
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're searching for I mean would they
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
fingerprint him if he has nothing on him
 
04:32:16.610 --> 04:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
what what can the trooper do
 
04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah see I I don't I don't have any
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
specifics on it um I know that State
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
Police has been involved in the bill and
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
has been kind of following it and and uh
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
but I I don't know enough about the
 
04:32:29.809 --> 04:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
details to really be able to answer that
 
04:32:32.570 --> 04:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative we created a card some
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
04:32:37.130 --> 04:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
for hearing impaired or so on that they
 
04:32:39.769 --> 04:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
would show it to the officer
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
to say that I'm hearing impaired or so
 
04:32:45.050 --> 04:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
some other problem and if they've always
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
had that with them
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
then you could put that on that same
 
04:32:52.210 --> 04:32:52.220 align:start position:0%
card the contact person is
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
but if there's anybody that I will as
 
04:32:56.929 --> 04:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
problem communicating or use American
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
sign language as something that the
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
officer is not going to know right that
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
they'd have to okay call this person on
 
04:33:06.769 --> 04:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
the phone and you know
 
04:33:08.510 --> 04:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you I think
 
04:33:11.209 --> 04:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
with the grown number of children that
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
we have with autism and the varying
 
04:33:18.529 --> 04:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
range of disabilities that we're seeing
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
I think I don't know for a fact but for
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
me it seems like it would be wonderful
 
04:33:26.209 --> 04:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
years ago I had a young man that had
 
04:33:28.490 --> 04:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
dysarthria or couldn't talk was stopped
 
04:33:30.051 --> 04:33:30.061 align:start position:0%
they thought he was drunk
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
um arrested it was very difficult for
 
04:33:34.010 --> 04:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
him if he had had a card he would have
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
just been able to show it to the police
 
04:33:38.449 --> 04:33:38.459 align:start position:0%
officer so I think that's the purpose of
 
04:33:41.090 --> 04:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
this bill if I'm I'm not sure I guess
 
04:33:43.730 --> 04:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what I'm asking
 
04:33:43.740 --> 04:33:44.269 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what I'm asking
um

04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
we have to figure that out uh
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative I'll be reaching more
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
since I have the laptop I pulled up the
 
04:33:53.570 --> 04:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
bill really quickly because honestly I
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
didn't remember the bill by the number I
 
04:33:57.890 --> 04:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
my brain doesn't work that way but
 
04:33:59.449 --> 04:33:59.459 align:start position:0%
essentially this says that somebody
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
would provide law enforcement you know
 
04:34:03.650 --> 04:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
information about this is the right
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
person to talk to me whether it's
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
through a guardian or directly or
 
04:34:09.769 --> 04:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
whatnot and when that person is stopped
 
04:34:11.449 --> 04:34:11.459 align:start position:0%
there should be a way for them to be
 
04:34:13.609 --> 04:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
told hey don't try to talk to this
 
04:34:16.490 --> 04:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
person after they identify them you
 
04:34:18.170 --> 04:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
really need to try to engage with this
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
contact person because the person you
 
04:34:21.410 --> 04:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
are spoken with cannot handle
 
04:34:23.631 --> 04:34:23.641 align:start position:0%
communication properly so that's you
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
know is you know what the bill is trying
 
04:34:28.010 --> 04:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
to do and since you're here we're just
 
04:34:29.449 --> 04:34:29.459 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what are your
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how much this could be
 
04:34:34.810 --> 04:34:34.820 align:start position:0%
implemented how would it work
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
Ed sure if I could just add um two cents
 
04:34:42.051 --> 04:34:42.061 align:start position:0%
about this so I think the real issue is
 
04:34:44.929 --> 04:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
the legal competence of communicating
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
with someone when you realize they're
 
04:34:48.051 --> 04:34:48.061 align:start position:0%
not fully up
 
04:34:50.330 --> 04:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
to the task when they interact with law
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think the intent of the
 
04:34:54.650 --> 04:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
bill is to provide a resource for folks
 
04:34:56.810 --> 04:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
once they identify that you know okay
 
04:34:58.490 --> 04:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
that maybe this isn't totally the right
 
04:34:59.810 --> 04:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
conversation it should be having right
 
04:35:02.810 --> 04:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
now they can reach out to this list if
 
04:35:05.090 --> 04:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
they're able to identify I think you
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
know trying to connect the dots of like
 
04:35:08.570 --> 04:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
who is this person
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
are they competent to handle this
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussion if we've decided they're not
 
04:35:14.689 --> 04:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
then the resources provided that they
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
can go to a list and try to figure out
 
04:35:18.590 --> 04:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
who is the correct contact I don't think
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to be doing the front end of
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
that connection connecting the dots but
 
04:35:24.769 --> 04:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
it's the back end resource if I'm
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly so that the
 
04:35:30.410 --> 04:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know law enforcement has a resource
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
at their fingertips once they're aware
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the situation I don't again I don't
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
think that it's really probably it
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
sounds like a self-reporting issue too
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
so families are aware of and you know
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
Guardians are aware if whether or not
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
they can take advantage of this of this
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
resource you know be added to the list
 
04:35:50.520 --> 04:35:51.830 align:start position:0%
resource you know be added to the list
so

04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:53.090 --> 04:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I think what we're trying to connect
 
04:35:55.131 --> 04:35:55.141 align:start position:0%
in our minds of how would this all work
 
04:35:58.609 --> 04:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
is probably a step farther than the bill
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
actually intends to go I think it's
 
04:36:02.570 --> 04:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
probably the back end of that
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
um you know legal response to to having
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
these interactions so
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
maybe um
 
04:36:12.590 --> 04:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
expanding on that maybe if we put it on
 
04:36:15.170 --> 04:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
because we figure if they're driving all
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
right you could put because you you do a
 
04:36:20.090 --> 04:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
check you know
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
you could check their driver's license
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
right the driver's license in the plate
 
04:36:24.769 --> 04:36:24.779 align:start position:0%
the vehicle registration would which
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
would not contain any of this right but
 
04:36:28.490 --> 04:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
you could we could put it on there well
 
04:36:30.051 --> 04:36:30.061 align:start position:0%
I think that would I think that would
 
04:36:31.970 --> 04:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know you would have to have further
 
04:36:33.289 --> 04:36:33.299 align:start position:0%
discussions that the only thing I'd like
 
04:36:35.929 --> 04:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
to to I don't I can't speak
 
04:36:35.939 --> 04:36:36.830 align:start position:0%
to to I don't I can't speak
um

04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:39.170 --> 04:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
um to the bill but I just would share
 
04:36:42.109 --> 04:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of um systems in
 
04:36:43.490 --> 04:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
place now when we have missing of
 
04:36:45.410 --> 04:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
vulnerable folks you'll see as you you
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
know see the news whether it's a silver
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
alert or
 
04:36:49.849 --> 04:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
um you know and I think a lot of these
 
04:36:49.859 --> 04:36:50.810 align:start position:0%
um you know and I think a lot of these
issues

04:36:50.810 --> 04:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
um even like at 9-1-1 you know in my
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
recent meeting with director Doyle
 
04:36:56.929 --> 04:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
there's systems in place so that you
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
know family members can provide
 
04:37:01.849 --> 04:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
information in advance of some unique
 
04:37:03.769 --> 04:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
circumstances at the household before
 
04:37:05.570 --> 04:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
the respondents get there you know maybe
 
04:37:07.310 --> 04:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
some of these conversations take place
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
at the local level you know and but if
 
04:37:13.369 --> 04:37:13.379 align:start position:0%
somebody is is missing or you know is
 
04:37:13.379 --> 04:37:14.990 align:start position:0%
somebody is is missing or you know is
vulnerable

04:37:14.990 --> 04:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
um just having a place where you can
 
04:37:18.650 --> 04:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
report that and a lot of times with all
 
04:37:20.209 --> 04:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
of these they put you know who do we
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
call who so I I think it's I think it's
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
it it's an important conversation but
 
04:37:28.250 --> 04:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
um to just say whether it would go on a
 
04:37:30.170 --> 04:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
driver's license or this you know would
 
04:37:32.689 --> 04:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
take a lot more discussion
 
04:37:34.970 --> 04:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you
 
04:37:38.090 --> 04:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair so but if we have if this
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
bill passed it must have passed to get
 
04:37:43.490 --> 04:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
to us I'm assuming we have it so is
 
04:37:46.250 --> 04:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
there a cost will there be a cost has
 
04:37:48.890 --> 04:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
been a fiscal note
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
so the bill did pass and was referred
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
here for review and there is a 50 000
 
04:37:56.209 --> 04:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
appropriation only in fiscal 24 for that
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
bill uh so that could be something if
 
04:38:00.410 --> 04:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
this committee the committee has voted
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
to retain that and consider it with
 
04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
House Bill too to update the department
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
I should have had you more prepared on
 
04:38:05.810 --> 04:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
this one I'm sorry about that and we are
 
04:38:07.609 --> 04:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
happy to go back to get the information
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%

04:38:12.529 --> 04:38:12.539 align:start position:0%
