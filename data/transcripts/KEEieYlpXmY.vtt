00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of people who
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
registered for five but
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
i expect that we should be able to get
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
through our hearing relatively quickly
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
the uh and what we'll do is we'll call
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
upon those people first who
 
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.230 align:start position:0%
upon those people first who
pre-registered

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
pre-registered
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
if other people are have con online and
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
wish to testify
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have them raise their hands at the
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
end of the pre-registered people that
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
they'll have the opportunity to testify
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
if they wish to do so
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm going to call upon
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative burch first if he would
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh just as a matter
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
of procedure
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
do we already have a motion on the floor
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
sb 96 overall so that i can introduce an
 
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.189 align:start position:0%
sb 96 overall so that i can introduce an
amendment

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
um i don't remember from last
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
time we met well it's uh hearing on the
 
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
time we met well it's uh hearing on the
motion

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
if if you would like to if you would
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
to accept that i think that would be
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
fine and then we can act on that
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
all right just just for procedural
 
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
all right just just for procedural
reasons

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
i would move otp on sb96
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
it happens yes okay
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
i'm told i'm told uh that
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm all messed up and that the amendment
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
should be offered in the executive
 
00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
should be offered in the executive
session

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case you can just
 
00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:07.749 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case you can just
testify

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
to the uh to your amendment all right
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
um but i don't need to formally
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
introduce it at this point
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
i see a no from the clerk so i will
 
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:21.749 align:start position:0%
i see a no from the clerk so i will
proceed

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and colleagues it's it's good to be
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
speaking with you again in favor of this
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
i'll try not to be too repetitive of
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
and you'll have the opportunity to hear
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
from some recognized experts
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
on this issue this legislation
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
guarantees the citizens of our state
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
have a right to go to state court for
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
redress of harms
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
done to them by the government this
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
legislation is not as complicated as
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
some would make it
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
an activist supreme court tried an
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
experiment in 1982
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
to provide qualified immunity to protect
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
some government actors
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
this experiment has been widely
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
considered a failure
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
and now the us congress and many states
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
are seeking to end this failure
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation does three
 
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.070 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation does three
things

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
by eliminating qualified immunity it
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
returns the law to how it was in 1982
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
pre-1982 it provides a path to state
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
court in addition to a currently
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
existing route to federal court
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
and it shifts the burden of any
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
financial penalty and costs from the
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
individual bad actor
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
to his or her government employer
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to some technical changes of
 
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.110 align:start position:0%
in addition to some technical changes of
language

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes some changes and
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
clarifies some important aspects from hb
 
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.829 align:start position:0%
clarifies some important aspects from hb
111

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
111
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
by putting some things into statute
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
is made explicit in this amendment
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
that state county and municipal
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
employees who are acting
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
in a judicial or legislative capacity
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
select board members aldermen commission
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
members and the like
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
will keep their immunity from suit in
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
their personal capacity
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
as they always have had it is made
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
explicit in this legislation
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
that the acts of state employees are to
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
be examined
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the light of what a reasonable state
 
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
in the light of what a reasonable state
employee

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
should have done given all the
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances existing at the time
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
the action was taken the employee must
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
act reasonably
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
the determination of reasonableness must
 
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.630 align:start position:0%
the determination of reasonableness must
embody

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
embody
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
allowance for the fact that employees
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
are sometimes forced to make judgments
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
in circumstances that are unclear about
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
what is necessary in a particular
 
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
what is necessary in a particular
situation

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
and finally the amendment removes the
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
alleged bad actor from lawsuits
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies and makes certain that the
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
individual actors not to be held
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
when a sheriff who shot a 10 year old
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%

when police officers stole cash and

property worth two hundred and twenty
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
then there's the question of sununu
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
youth center
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
where hundreds of claims have been made
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
if that in fact did happen
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
should those abusers and their employer
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
be protected from civil suit by their
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
victims because of qualified immunity
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
let's clear up a few misconceptions this
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation has nothing to do with
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
the courts have and will continue to
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
have plenty of power
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
to dismiss frivolous suits and impose
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
sanctions financial and otherwise
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
on those who file them studies in
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
colorado and california debunked the
 
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
colorado and california debunked the
claim

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
that municipal costs will increase to
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
any significant degree with this type of
 
00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
any significant degree with this type of
legislation

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
if there are costs that is due solely to
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
the misconduct
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
by state actors not legislation
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
it helps the time to return to basic
 
00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:08.629 align:start position:0%
it helps the time to return to basic
principles

00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
principles
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
the first is something every person here
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
probably subscribes to
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
the citizen is in a higher position than
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
the government
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
the government works for the citizen not
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the other way around
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is a bedrock conservative principal
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
a bedrock libertarian principal
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
and a bedrock liberal principal
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
basic principle number two when the
 
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.829 align:start position:0%
basic principle number two when the
government

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
harms a citizen the government then
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
cannot decide the citizen has no redress
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
that the citizen is out of luck the
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
government gives itself immunity
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
from the citizen our founders in new
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire had it exactly
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
right 1784 when they wrote part 1
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
article 14 of our constitution
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
legal remedies to be free complete and
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
prompt every subject
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
of this state is entitled to a certain
 
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
of this state is entitled to a certain
remedy

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
by having recourse to the laws for all
 
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.710 align:start position:0%
by having recourse to the laws for all
injuries

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
he may receive in his personal property
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
or character
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
and goes on from there
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
i have no quarrel with those who are
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
focused on the potential liability
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
of county and local and state entities
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
who continue
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
who employ or continue to employ people
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
who violate constitutional rights of
 
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.910 align:start position:0%
who violate constitutional rights of
citizens

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
our county executive committee does our
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
budget in cheshire county
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
i've served on it for nine years i'm
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
currently chair
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
i know much of what there is to know
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
about county budgets
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i know two things this legislation
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
will not
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
cost local governments money bad
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
behaving employees
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
will cost local entities money
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
you want to avoid these costs higher
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
well train well
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
we self-insure in cheshire county and we
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
put our focus on
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
i also have no quarrel with either the
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for the municipalities
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
a thoughtful and by the way very nice
 
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
a thoughtful and by the way very nice
person

00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh nor with lobbyists for police unions
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
i support unions and what they do for
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
their members
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
but their job is to look after the
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
narrow interests
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
of their particular clients and to
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
direct your attention
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
specifically to the interests of their
 
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.590 align:start position:0%
specifically to the interests of their
employers

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
a slice of the pie as it were their job
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
is not to look after
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
the public interest that's our job
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
as many of you know i was a career
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
public defender
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
my job basically was to get my clients
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
off with the leastest
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with the rules and ethical
 
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.509 align:start position:0%
consistent with the rules and ethical
guidelines

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's not my job to look out for the
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
public interest that was the job of
 
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.949 align:start position:0%
public interest that was the job of
others

00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
similarly the job of lobbyists for the
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
police and municipalities is not to look
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
out for the public interest
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
just to get their clients off so to
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
speak with the leases
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's honorable that's not the job of
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
or the legislature we need to look at
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
the whole pie
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
not just a slice and i think it's
 
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.790 align:start position:0%
not just a slice and i think it's
inescapable

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
inescapable
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
that the qualified immunity is a failed
 
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.150 align:start position:0%
that the qualified immunity is a failed
experiment

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
experiment
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
not in the public interest i do have a
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
bit of a quarrel
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
with what i received yesterday from the
 
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.069 align:start position:0%
with what i received yesterday from the
lobbyist

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire municipal
 
00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.710 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire municipal
association

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
um the uh and i assume the committee
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
received the same
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh letter uh in it the claim was made
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
that if this amendment were passed
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
litigation and insurance costs will rise
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities will have even more
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
trouble recruiting employees individuals
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
will be reluctant
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
the servant town government there will
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
be absolutely no positive effects
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
on the behavior of municipal employees
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
or officials
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
frankly this is virtually word for word
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
what we heard
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
from the same folks several years ago
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
when we considered removing standing
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
or uh changing the laws of standing
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
to allow taxpayers to sue in our state
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
something that was approved by this
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee approved by the house and
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
senate and approved by the public
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
and guess what we were told that
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
litigation insurance costs would rise
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
nope didn't happen municipalities will
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
have trouble recruiting employees nope
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
didn't happen individuals will be
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
reluctant to serve in town government
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
nope didn't happen
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
there'll be no positive effects on the
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
behavior of this employees
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
now basically very few things were
 
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.310 align:start position:0%
now basically very few things were
brought

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
i want to respond specifically to the
 
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.230 align:start position:0%
i want to respond specifically to the
last

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
claim absolutely no positive effects on
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
behavior municipal employees
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm saddened to read that claim
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
because i also read a very short time
 
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.669 align:start position:0%
because i also read a very short time
ago

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
that the um the world's
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
largest municipal police union the
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
benevolent police benevolent association
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
wrote to its members after new york city
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
recently passed qualified immunity
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
and they told
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
their members that they strongly caution
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
police officers to limit their searches
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
of individuals
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
or private property to cases where the
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
officers clearly and unequivocally
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
and went on to some detail saying now
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't have qualified immunity
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
you got to really be sure that you're
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
operating within the strictures of the
 
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
operating within the strictures of the
law

police benevolent association and i
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
believe that's
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
that approach is good police work and
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's good for the community
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
that no positive effects will occur
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh on behavior municipal employees
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
or officials finally
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
we know that citizens are being harmed
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
by bad acting government employees and
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
these employees in the government agency
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
that hire them are far too
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's what this legislation will
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative burch
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative here good morning now
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative burch
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
um they take my question you named off
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
some scenarios
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
this morning one was where a young boy
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
was shot by the police
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
over the dog a tear gas incident in the
 
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
over the dog a tear gas incident in the
home

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
and also about 250 000 being stolen
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
during a search warrant
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
were these new hampshire cases or were
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
these cases in other states
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh as far as i know those were cases in
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
there are uh and thank you for your
 
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.830 align:start position:0%
there are uh and thank you for your
question

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
um there are two further comments on
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are cases especially with
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
excessive use of force that occur
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
and are being litigated to some extent
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
because it's hard to litigate
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and prior
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
events uh former uh
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
justice douglas has made reference to a
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
couple of cases that he's actively
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
involved in right now
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
which i think involved the at least one
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
the nashua police department
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
the uh the difficulty is
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
that you with immunity you don't know
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
how many of these cases exist
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
because let's say i am harmed
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
by or believe i am harmed by the action
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
improper action of a police officer
 
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.789 align:start position:0%
improper action of a police officer
violated

00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
violated
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
let's say my constitutional rights i go
 
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
let's say my constitutional rights i go
to

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
a lawyer and the lawyer says it's not
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
worth the time and effort to bring the
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
suit because it's going to get thrown
 
00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:48.310 align:start position:0%
suit because it's going to get thrown
out

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
on qualified immunity
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i go away and there's no record of it
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
there's no way of
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
quantifying how many of those cases
 
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.350 align:start position:0%
quantifying how many of those cases
exist

00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
but they do exist some of them are being
 
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
but they do exist some of them are being
litigated

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
litigated
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative a follow-up question
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
mr burch
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
ah representative sorry about that
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire have a process to
 
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
new hampshire have a process to
investigate

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
um allegations against police officers
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
that they may
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
and there's certainly an open question
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
about how effective that is and how
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
effective it isn't
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
but that's a different issue than
 
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.710 align:start position:0%
but that's a different issue than
whether

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
a victim in ak in a situation
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
has a right to go to court and ask for
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
redress of their harms
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
um a uh a process
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
may find that the officer acted
 
00:22:57.679 --> 00:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
may find that the officer acted
correctly

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
or incorrectly or whatever that may be
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
and and criminal charges may be broader
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
or may not be brought
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation has to do
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
with the right of you or me to go to
 
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.590 align:start position:0%
with the right of you or me to go to
court

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
and say a government actor violated my
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%

pre-registered the first one would be
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative lim
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
if he's there
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative lynn if you could raise
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me we can oh thank you
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman and members of the
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'll i have several points i'd like to
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
make and i'll try to make be as brief as
 
00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:27.430 align:start position:0%
make and i'll try to make be as brief as
possible

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you first of all i i would say it
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
just initially
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
the although this bill has been referred
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment has been referred to as
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment that eliminates qualified
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
immunity the term
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity comes from
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
primarily from federal case law
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
as far as i know in the state of new
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire under our case law i don't
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a case
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
that uses the term qualified immunity
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
rather we refer to
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
statutory immunity or common law
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
official immunity
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
and i point that out simply because um
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
to avoid any confusion
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
um i think the concepts are basically
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
the same but
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
but terminology sometimes can be
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
important the
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
the first point that i would make is
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
that it's important for the committee to
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
understand that this bill
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
does not simply eliminate
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity or official immunity
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
it also creates a constitutional cause
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
of action
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
under state law to allow to allow the
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
recovery of damages
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that there is no
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
need for the creation of such a cause of
 
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
need for the creation of such a cause of
action

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would contrast i would ask the
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee to contrast this
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
with i think the argument has has been
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
made that this is really
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
creating the state law equivalent of a
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
federal cause of action
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
similar to the one authorized under uh
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
section 1983
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
of title 42 of the u.s code
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is there was a reason for
 
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.789 align:start position:0%
the problem is there was a reason for
having

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
section 1983 as a to allow a
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional cause of action
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
under the fed under the federal
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
constitution because there is no
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
body of federal tort law federal tort
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
law as a practical matter doesn't exist
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
but in new hampshire we have a
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
well-developed body of state tort law
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
and in fact what any anything
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter anything that
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
could be characterized as a
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
violation of state of state
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional law
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
you know with i i can't i can't frankly
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
think of an exception and i would offer
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
i would invite somebody to
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
to uh offer one but anything that would
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
be a violation of state
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional law would also constitute
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
a common law tort in new hampshire such
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
as the tort of
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
assault for on you unlawful use of force
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
or excessive use of force
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
or battery or false imprisonment or
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
malicious prosecution
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
or trespass if for example the police
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
executed a search warrant without
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
probable clause
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
or invasion of privacy or interference
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
with contractual relations
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
etc there is so there is no reason to
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
create a
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
new constitutional tort when conduct
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
that is wrongful can be can be
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
a remedy under state under state common
 
00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:25.190 align:start position:0%
a remedy under state under state common
law

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
um this bill also provo purports to to
 
00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:28.950 align:start position:0%
um this bill also provo purports to to
allow

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
a claim for equitable relief but
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
equitable release of
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity has not been
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
it certainly is not a defense where
 
00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:39.350 align:start position:0%
it certainly is not a defense where
where

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
a litigant is seeking equitable relief
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
future uh future misconduct so that's
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
again the qualified immunity just would
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
have no application there
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
now to the the one thing about this the
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
one part of this bill that i think
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably i would agree is a good idea
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
is to allow attorneys fees to be claimed
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
in in uh cases where there's a claim
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know of of the type that is that
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh that would involve uh police
 
00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:08.870 align:start position:0%
uh that would involve uh police
misconduct

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
um so i guess the question i would have
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
is why create this
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
new constitutional cause of action when
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's no necessity for
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
it and when it invites the opportunity
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
for just sort of creating confusion
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer you know good lawyers will argue
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
that oh well
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
assault and battery may prohibit this
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
but now this is a constitutional claim
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's some nuance that's different
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
let's make a let's create a new body of
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
law why do that
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
when there's really no need for that to
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
be done the common law provides
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
perfectly adequate remedies the second
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
point i would make is
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
that this amendment may be
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to the extent that it
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
seeks to eliminate
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
the naming of individual officers as
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
defendants in suits based on
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
federal law or to the extent that it
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
eliminates qualified immunity
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
for defendants in section 1983 actions
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
and if you read the bill
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
it purports to this cause of action that
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
it creates is one
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
that would apply for violations of the
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
united states constitution also
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
although the u.s supreme court has held
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
that section 1983 actions can be brought
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
into state court
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
um i i firmly believe that that the
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
state cannot change
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
substantive federal law so that for
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
example if a suit
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
if the suit is based on a violation of
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
the federal constitution
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state would have the
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
authority to eliminate qualified
 
00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
authority to eliminate qualified
immunity

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
only the federal uh courts could do that
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
could do that and the same thing would
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
apply to eliminating uh
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
removing individual officers as
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
defendants if it was if the suit was
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
brought under federal law i don't think
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
the state could do that the third point
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
i think this is very important is that
 
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:50.549 align:start position:0%
i think this is very important is that
this

00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment goes further than hb-111 did
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
in at least one important respect in
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
that it purports to eliminate immunity
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
not just for cause of act causes of
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
action where the law was not
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
clearly established at the time of the
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
police action
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
but also for cases where the officer
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
acted reasonably
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
at the time in question and i refer you
 
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.789 align:start position:0%
at the time in question and i refer you
specifically

00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
to propose rsa 507 h4
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
1a the second clause and rsa 507 h41b
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think this is very problematic because
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
reasonableness is itself
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
often the standard for determining
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
whether police action
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
is constitutional or unconstitutional
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
police are allowed to make a stop if
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
they have reasonable suspicion that a
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
crime is about to be committed
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
or may conduct a search without us a
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
warrant if they reasonably
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
believe exigent circumstances exist does
 
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.310 align:start position:0%
believe exigent circumstances exist does
the

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
does this amendment's language that
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
quote the court shall not be impeded by
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
an invocation of a state agent's
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
defense or immunity close quote um
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh as proposed in rsa 507 h41
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
where such immunity is based on the
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
reasonableness of the officer's conduct
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
mean that reasonableness is no longer to
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
be considered in assessing whether the
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
conduct was unconstitutional in the
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
first place
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
i assume that that was not what the
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
drafters intended but that is
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
but but that is a a real problem in
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
terms of what does what does
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
reasonableness mean
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
why is the reasonableness different here
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
than than reasonable
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of what of what the
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional right is in the first
 
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.029 align:start position:0%
constitutional right is in the first
place

00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
eliminating suits against officers
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
personally by
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
providing that only the state or
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
municipality will be named as a
 
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:36.470 align:start position:0%
municipality will be named as a
defendant

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
does not solve the problem of inhibiting
 
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.470 align:start position:0%
does not solve the problem of inhibiting
officers

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
from properly doing their jobs first
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
i should point out that this amendment
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
would eliminate personal liability
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
even when an officer clearly was acting
 
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.029 align:start position:0%
even when an officer clearly was acting
unlawful

00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
unlawful
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
and my question would be why would you
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
want to do that if an officer clearly
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
was violating the law why shouldn't they
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
be held personally liable
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
i would certainly think they should be
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
second imposing liability on the
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
governmental unit does not resolve the
 
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.830 align:start position:0%
governmental unit does not resolve the
problem

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
because if the municipality is to be
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
held liable for officers actions that
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
were not clearly wrong when they
 
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.230 align:start position:0%
were not clearly wrong when they
occurred

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
such governmental units will encourage
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
their officers to be reticent to do
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
when there is a chance that the state or
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
the town could be sued
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
the wash word for officers from their
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
political leaders the mayors governors
 
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.230 align:start position:0%
political leaders the mayors governors
whatever

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
will become look away don't be curious
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't pursue suspicious activity in any
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
situation where your actions might be
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
called into question
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh later and and state or municipal
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
state or municipality
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
be held liable and the officers will
 
00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:44.870 align:start position:0%
be held liable and the officers will
listen

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
listen
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
particularly since this amendment
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
specifically says
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
that if the state or local government is
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
found liable for a constitutional
 
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.789 align:start position:0%
found liable for a constitutional
violation

00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
even if the officer acted reasonably the
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
officer can be terminated from his job
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding for example any
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
protections that might be offered by a
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i for that i refer you specifically
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
to section
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh h61 of this proposed amendment
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
as can be seen from rising crime rates
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
all right and i don't want to cut you
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
short but if you could sort of wrap up
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
sure all right as a rising from the past
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
for five minutes and we've done about
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
ten so i'm
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry all right uh uh as i think can
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
be seen from
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
from rising crime rates resulting from
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
things like defund the police movement
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
and other anti-police rhetoric
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
police hearing uh police will be
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
encouraged to adopt a hunker down
 
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
encouraged to adopt a hunker down
mentality

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
mentality
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
if this uh if this uh uh
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
amendment were to uh were to be adopted
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
so i would suggest at first that this
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
amendment should
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
should not be adopted um and that we
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
should that
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
that this matter should be studied uh
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
over the summer and
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps brought back in a more
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way in the in the fall
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
but so i would say just don't do
 
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.149 align:start position:0%
but so i would say just don't do
anything

00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
kill the amendment and don't do anything
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
but if you if the committee feels that
 
00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
but if you if the committee feels that
some

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
is the need to do something i have i've
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
sent committee members a proposal
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
that i think solves the specific
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
problem of where qualified immunity has
 
00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:17.589 align:start position:0%
problem of where qualified immunity has
been

00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
applied improperly by some courts
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
without eliminating qualified immunity
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
and so as a fallback position i would
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to consider that
 
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.190 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to consider that
amendment

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm happy to answer
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
representative smith do you have a
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:33.829 align:start position:0%
representative smith do you have a
question

00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
yes i do mr chairman thank you very much
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
um representative lynn are you
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
saying that the police
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
make their decisions about
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
how to act in certain circumstances
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
based on whether it would be better to
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
i think in your words hunkered down
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
than to follow
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
both the law and their ethical
 
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.950 align:start position:0%
both the law and their ethical
responsibilities

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
as public employees i
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure i'm saying that that
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
certainly is a consideration i think
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
we've seen that kind of thing happen
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
around the country i mean new york city
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
is a perfect example
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
the the police have you know the message
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's gone out is
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
just back off you know look away
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
because if you don't you you know if
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's any kind of chance that you
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
might uh
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
that you're gonna end up um uh being
 
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
that you're gonna end up um uh being
sued

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
sued
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh that's the safer course and
 
00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
uh that's the safer course and
unfortunately

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think that there are a number of
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
officers who will who will who will
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
decide that's the reasonable choice to
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
be made and we shouldn't be encouraging
 
00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
be made and we shouldn't be encouraging
that

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
could i could i just follow up quickly i
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
know that representative lynn has taken
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of time
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to exacerbate the
 
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.950 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to exacerbate the
situation

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
um but are you also saying um
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative lynn that those people
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
and there's in
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh with the responsibility of hiring
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
public officials therefore
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
should not exercise the most
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
rigorous investigation in terms of
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
hiring and in terms of training
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
and in terms of supervising and in terms
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
of holding people accountable
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
because it would be better just to let
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
anybody in
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
and then let them do what they want to
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
do i'm not
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that at all i don't i'm
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that in the slightest i
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
think it's absolutely important that
 
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:43.990 align:start position:0%
think it's absolutely important that
that

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
police officers be you know trained very
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
very well and that they be held
 
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.349 align:start position:0%
very well and that they be held
accountable

hampshire
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh and just to clear it up uh we are in
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
support of the amendment we're neutral
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
on sb 96 in totality
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is quite
 
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.349 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is quite
straightforward

00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
it makes changes to hb 111 as we've
 
00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
it makes changes to hb 111 as we've
heard

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh and these changes address much of the
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
feedback and concern we heard from the
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
debate on hb 111.
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
specifically it ensures the employee's
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
name will not be listed on the suit
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
instead listing the government entity or
 
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.710 align:start position:0%
instead listing the government entity or
employer

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment also makes clear that
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislative immunity will still apply to
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
all elected officials
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
this includes local elected local
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
who the courts have determined fall
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
under the doctrine of legislative
 
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.470 align:start position:0%
under the doctrine of legislative
immunity

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
not qualified immunity and this uh these
 
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:13.990 align:start position:0%
not qualified immunity and this uh these
changes

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
also uh do not apply to the
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
judicial branch this amendment will
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
not have the an effect on good
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
government employees but instead
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
creates a remedy for the few bad actors
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
in government
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
who violate citizen rights currently if
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
a citizen's rights have been violated by
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
a government agent
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
there are very few avenues for the
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
citizen to hold the government
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
accountable for the actions of the
 
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
accountable for the actions of the
employee

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
this type of undermining of
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
accountability leads to an erosion of
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
trust between
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
citizens and its government particularly
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity allows few officers
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
who do not
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
allows the few officers who do not who
 
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:57.589 align:start position:0%
allows the few officers who do not who
do

00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
violate sorry a person's rights from
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
being held accountable
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
which makes a good officer's job much
 
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.670 align:start position:0%
which makes a good officer's job much
harder

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
harder
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
we live in a constitutional republic if
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
our constitutional rights are being
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
violated by the government
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
then that one bad actor in government
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
breeds distrust across the entire
 
00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.589 align:start position:0%
breeds distrust across the entire
population

00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
as we have seen and it's important to
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
remember that qualified immunity
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
only becomes relevant after it is
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
determined that the government has
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
violated a person's constitutional
 
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.589 align:start position:0%
violated a person's constitutional
rights

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
public officials specifically law
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement is already given great
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
deference on what is reasonable
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
and what isn't objectively reasonable
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
decisions are protected by the
 
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.190 align:start position:0%
decisions are protected by the
constitution

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
with or without qualified immunity
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity is also completely
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
antithetical to the spirit and founding
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
principles of new hampshire
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
it harkens back to the days of the
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
divine right of kings
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
which was the idea that since the kings
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
are appointed by god
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
they could only be held accountable by
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
god new hampshire's was one of the first
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
places on earth to challenge that idea
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
ebenezer mudjit josiah bartlett and john
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
stark stood up to the
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
to the stood up to the monarchy in
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
defense of citizens rights
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
for a more accountable government for
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
and by the people
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
our entire structure of government was
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
built upon accountability
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
that is why we have an executive council
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
to provide a check on executive power of
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
it is why we have one of the largest
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislatures in the world
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
government and its employees should not
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
be above the law
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they should be and they should not
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
be above accountability
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
from the people they serve we must
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
restore this trust in
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
in our government and reforming the good
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
doctrine of qualified immunity will go a
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
long way towards doing just that
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment is simply about
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
government accountability
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
transparency and upholding our
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental constitutional rights
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons we urge the
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
committee to approve this amendment to
 
00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
committee to approve this amendment to

judge gordon
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
i am speaking today regarding the
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 96 that closely mirrors
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 111
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
which in essence revokes municipal
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity at every level
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not the
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
employee was acting in good
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
faith there are many unintended
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
consequences to this amendment
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
that will eliminate the protection the
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
protections under qualified immunity
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
earlier today in earlier testimony and
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
in testimony from house bill 111 many of
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
you have heard
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
testimony on topics such as the
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
amendment is overarching
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
not just affecting the police department
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
as many think the attention of this
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%

punishes the municipality for good

and bad acting employees and it may have

further unattended consequences

they should

other testimony was that this amendment
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
would make it near impossible
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
to replace our aging municipal workforce
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
and increasingly empty chairs on our
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
volunteer boards and commissions as
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
citizens would be fearful of the

not all lawsuits resulting from bad

public amenities such as public parks

that are free of charge
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
that that also benefit from the

protections of qualified immunity
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
i agree with all this prior testimony
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
but what you may not know
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
and what i'd like to talk about today is
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
how this amendment would devastate
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
a community like franklin it would put
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
poorer and small communities at a
 
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.550 align:start position:0%
poorer and small communities at a
disadvantage

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
and hinder those communities ability to
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
move forward economically
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
let me explain franklin is a mill town
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
we are once a thriving community but
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
after the last mill mills closed in the
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
early 70s we have steadily declined
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
to a revenue star starved property poor
 
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.309 align:start position:0%
to a revenue star starved property poor
community

00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
over the last five years franklin has
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
pulled up its bootstraps and put in the
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
work to reinvent ourselves in a
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
sustainable way that will bring
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
economic vitality back to our community
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
those communities surrounding us the
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
results of those efforts are finally
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
coming to fruition in 2021
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
as the construction of our white water
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
kayak venue in the winnipesaukee river
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
will begin this summer
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
as many of you have probably heard in
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
recent news articles
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
this whitewater kayak park is the first
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
of its kind
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
in new england although there are over
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
300 parks in north america
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
it will bring a whole new outdoor
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
recreation economy
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
imagine the ski industry coming to new
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire for the first time
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
this outdoor recreation economy is based
 
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.190 align:start position:0%
this outdoor recreation economy is based
on

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
evidence from the other 300 parks show
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
that will bring over 160
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
000 visitors to watch those taking part
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
in the activities in the river those
 
00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:56.950 align:start position:0%
in the activities in the river those
visitors

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
visitors
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
mrs milner i don't want to cut you short
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
we and we appreciate what you're doing
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
with the water park but if you could
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
just focus on the amendment that would
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
be appreciated
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm getting to that thank you um
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
so this outdoor park is going to be the
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
anchor of our outdoor amenities
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be it's going to be
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
our revitalization effort to become an
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation destination
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
so we have several outdoor recreation
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
events in the city they're all free to
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment taking away qualified
 
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.630 align:start position:0%
this amendment taking away qualified
immunity

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
from those makes it difficult for us to
 
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.470 align:start position:0%
from those makes it difficult for us to
continue

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
along that path of economic development
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
so qualified immunity allows us to
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
provide these amenities
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
which will drive out which will
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
sorry excuse me bring in our economic
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
engine and bring vitality back to the
 
00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.870 align:start position:0%
engine and bring vitality back to the
community

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
franklin simply could not afford any of
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
this without qualified immunity
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
although franklin will take pride in
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
keeping our amenities maintained and
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
safe for the users there is inherent
 
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.150 align:start position:0%
safe for the users there is inherent
risk

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
in any outdoor recreation activity
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity protects us
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
from that risk our little community
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
pays currently 165 000 per year for
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
property liability insurance
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
with qualified immunity in place
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
recently the city had all of our
 
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.670 align:start position:0%
recently the city had all of our
insurances

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
insurances
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
including our property liability
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
insurance out to quote to ensure the
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
best rates for the citizens of franklin
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
franklin does not participate in the
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
public pool for property liability but
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
does have a private insurance carrier
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
so all of the insurances came back with
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
the exception of property liability
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
we were told that the potential
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
elimination of qualified immunity was a
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
bigger communities may be able to afford
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
the increases in property liability or
 
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:51.910 align:start position:0%
the increases in property liability or
judgments

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
judgments
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
imposed franklin and other communities
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
like us simply cannot afford to maintain
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage or afford damages
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
from potential and likely frivolous
 
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.630 align:start position:0%
from potential and likely frivolous
lawsuits

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
resulting from using our free to the
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
public amenities that will drive
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
our revitalization amenities that will
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
no longer be viable
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
because the risk may be too high will be
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
things like the white water kayak park
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
our ski mountain playgrounds parks ice
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%

i'm almost there thank you very much so
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
these are the things that
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
this community that is redefining
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
themselves as an outdoor recreation
 
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.549 align:start position:0%
themselves as an outdoor recreation
needs

00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%

immunity
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
is necessary to move forward with this
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
economic development effort
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment will strip
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
franklin and many other communities of
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
the things that will make them
 
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.829 align:start position:0%
the things that will make them
communities

00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
and not a place to put your stuff this
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment will kill franklin's
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
best shot of economic recovery in the
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
past 50 years
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
and make the last five years of our
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
efforts for naught
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
please consider the unintended
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
consequences of this amendment when

miss milner but are you
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
saying um that franklin is planning to
 
00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:39.430 align:start position:0%
saying um that franklin is planning to
do

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
things that are not responsible
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of protecting the best
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
interests of the city
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
and of the public and therefore you want
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
free of any uh responsibility for what
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
you do no um franklin is committed to
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining the best
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
possible parks um all of our free
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%

then i
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
i don't really see the relationship um
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
between uh this proposed amendment
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
and uh and and your um
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%

respect the committee's
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
time and therefore hope that we could
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
talk about it on
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
another occasion so we can explore those
 
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
another occasion so we can explore those
views

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
views
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i do have an example
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to talk about it
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
not right now because i think we you
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
know we try to make sure we hear from as
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
many people as possible
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you understand that absolutely
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative oregon did you have a
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
well yeah sure yes first of all uh miss
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
milner i hope
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh hope whoever there's a shooting
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
incident in franklin i hope
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
the gunman or government government is
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
found soon in the situation resolved but
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
how how was your situation
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
as a municipality that's developing a
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
white water kayaking thing or any other
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
any other attraction of that sort how
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
are you different from a
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
private entrepreneur private if a
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
private company wanted to start one they
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
would probably take it for granted that
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
they would need that they could be sued
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody was seriously injured that
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
they were involved
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
right so unlike a private entrepreneur
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
um who would charge a fee and
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
pay their liability insurance out of
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
that fee the city of franklin is
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
providing these amenities free of charge
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
to the community so um so it makes it a
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
little bit different than a private
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
person where you could if you go to a
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
ski mountain you are paying for that
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
lift ticket
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
for sure but in franklin's ski mountain
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
is a community ski mountain
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
and there's little to no fee to use it
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
um okay so what
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
oh okay i just wondering what the oh so
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
what's the uh
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
what sort of the financial uh plan for
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
it if there's no fees so how is this
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
being paid for right right so um
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
our community like i said bootstraps um
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of fundraising in the
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
community in order to provide these
 
00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:19.190 align:start position:0%
community in order to provide these
amenities

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
amenities
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
many of our children 60 are free to
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
reduce lunch in our school district so
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
we'd like to provide these amenities to
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
give them something
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
better to do with their time um so
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we do in franklin all right
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.710 align:start position:0%
testify today in support of amendment
1244

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
1244
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
h to senate bill 96 because it
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
represents the gold standard
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
for state civil rights reform and it's
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
an excellent opportunity for new
 
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.829 align:start position:0%
an excellent opportunity for new
hampshire

00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
to continue leading the country in
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
protecting individual liberties
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
today i wanted to make uh just three
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
very swift points the first
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
is that it's important that
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities are held responsible
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
for the bad actions of their employees
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
because that's the very same standard
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
that we apply
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
every day in the private sector because
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
we as a society recognize
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
that employers have a responsibility to
 
00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:48.069 align:start position:0%
that employers have a responsibility to
hire

00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
hire
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
better to train better and to supervise
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
and municipalities are no different
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative lynn earlier made
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
a comment that perhaps it would be best
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
to hold officers individually liable
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
but one of the problems with that
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
approach is that it leaves the victims
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
of government misconduct to the whims
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
of the officer's bank account and when
 
00:54:09.599 --> 00:54:10.870 align:start position:0%
of the officer's bank account and when
victims

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
are faced with a constitutional
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
violation and they go after a
 
00:54:15.079 --> 00:54:16.230 align:start position:0%
violation and they go after a
judgment-proof

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
judgment-proof
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
officer an officer who cannot pay for
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
the violations that they committed then
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
the victim is left without an effective
 
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
the victim is left without an effective
remedy

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why municipalities need to be
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
on the hook for the bad actions of their
 
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.950 align:start position:0%
on the hook for the bad actions of their
employees

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
the second point i want to make is to
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
echo what representative burch said in
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
his opening remarks
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
which is that the costs of ending
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity are not inherent to
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're inherent to the bad actors in
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
but i want to make one further point and
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's the fact that these
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
costs already exist the problem is that
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
they're being born
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
by the victims of government misconduct
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
they're being born by people all over
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire who currently
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
don't have a remedy when their vit when
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
their rights excuse me
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
have been violated and so what this
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislation does is it reapportions
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
those costs it doesn't create them
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
it reapportions them to the
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
organizations and entities within the
 
00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.270 align:start position:0%
organizations and entities within the
state

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for them
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
lastly i wanted to respond to a couple
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the earlier comments
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
that were made first by representative
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
lynn about reasonableness
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh and and with respect to
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative len i i think he misreads
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
the plain text of
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
of this law when he directs the
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
committee to 507
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
h4 subpart one a
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
because that discussion of
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
reasonableness in the statute pretty
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
clearly refers to an officer's
 
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.190 align:start position:0%
clearly refers to an officer's
subjective

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of his activity and what i
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
mean by that is
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
is that under this amended law the fact
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
that an officer subjectively believed
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
that what he was doing was okay
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
is no defense because his objective
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
standard as
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has has frequently
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
held in a variety of cases
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
is is all that matters and so his
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
concern that
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
somehow this invocation or excuse me
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
this this bar
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
of reasonableness would would lead to
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
all kinds of a parade of horribles
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
is uh is frankly unfounded and lastly
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted to respond to uh some of the
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
comments from from the previous speaker
 
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:21.910 align:start position:0%
comments from from the previous speaker
about

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
the the franklin water park because you
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
know respectfully i
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think she misunderstands the role of
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
because qualified immunity has nothing
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
to do with negligent slip and fall cases
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the type that you might expect to see
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
in a public utility like a water park it
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
has to do with the deprivation of
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
and and with respect to the previous
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
speaker i do not know many water parks
 
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.390 align:start position:0%
speaker i do not know many water parks
whose

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
whose
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
business models are built on the wanton
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
deprivation of constitutional rights
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
and if there are any i certainly would
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
not want to attend such a water park
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
so with all that said i i respectfully
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote in favor of
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
amendment 1244
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
h and i am happy to answer any questions
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr neely representative
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
alexander do you have a question i do mr
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
terry thank you
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr neely for taking my
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
question um your last example about the
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
water park how
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's no deprivation a
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional right are you aware of
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the amendment there is
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
also a violation of law
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
is uh gives warrant for a
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit or a cost of action as well so
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
well it's the rights privileges or
 
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
well it's the rights privileges or
immunities

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
immunities
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
secured by those laws so i i would
 
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.990 align:start position:0%
secured by those laws so i i would
respectfully

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
respond that it's not simply a
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
deprivation of the law
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
it's a deprivation of a law that creates
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
a an
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
individual right and in in prior cases
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh and really throughout this this
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
nation's entire jurisprudence right
 
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:51.750 align:start position:0%
nation's entire jurisprudence right
there's

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a distinction between
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
simply a violation of a law and a
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
violation of a law that was intended to
 
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.270 align:start position:0%
violation of a law that was intended to
create

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
an individual right so again i i don't
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
even as this law is currently written
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
you would see slip and fall cases become
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
a constitutional tort that's that's not
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
what the language
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
as i understand it that's not what the
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
language of of this amendment would do
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%

00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
feelings aside
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
and look at facts from a myriad of
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
perspectives and you
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
legislators must be courageous also you
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.750 align:start position:0%
show up for people and do the tough
stuff

stuff
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
and as the resident thread puller i have
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
several questions for you today is
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
sliding language from a bill that was
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
previously laid on the table
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
courageous is the obfuscation of months
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
of hard work and consensus building
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
to create sb 96 courageous and possibly
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
killing this bill
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
with a decidedly short-sighted attempt
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
at vainglory is that courageous
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%

01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
this legislative process
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
even though it can be very frustrating
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
however i am extremely disheartened
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the repudiation etched into the
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
language of amendment 1244-h
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
i would also ask that this body of which
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
i include the sponsors of the amendment
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
are to vote itl on said amendment and
 
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.109 align:start position:0%
are to vote itl on said amendment and
allow

01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
sb 96 to proceed forth a conversation
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
about the actual content of 1244-h
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
can be had again just not in this way
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%

officer and former chief of police
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
for a handful of reasons that i'd like
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
to offer some perspective on
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
the first is as a retired chief of
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%

um i don't find that to be an enjoyable
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
situation i find it to be
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
stressful but i do acknowledge that
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
citizens have the recourse to bring suit
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i know that i am indemnified as
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
having liability for the
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes of those suits based on the
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
fact that it was part and parcel with my
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh official duties
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%

and it really had an effect in my
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
opinion on um
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity this was a case where
 
01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:50.950 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity this was a case where
um

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
tolan was in a car he owned going to a
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
house he lived in
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
with his mother when an officer
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
misentered the license plate
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
thought his car was stolen and
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
approached him in his own driveway with
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
his brother and his mother
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
all of whom were unarmed held them at
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
gunpoint and when the mother became
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
indignant saying this is my car
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
these are my sons i live here why are
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
you pointing a gun at me nobody's armed
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
the officer went hands on with the
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
mother toll and cursed and said get the
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
f off my mom and rose up from the ground
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
he was shot it ended his career in
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
professional baseball he was ascending
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
to that his father was a major league
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
baseball player
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
it had a permanent effect on his health
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
and for him
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
and his family to get any redress at all
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
for being in their own driveway with
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
their own car
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
in front of their own home unarmed just
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
going about their business completely
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
because a police officer entered a
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
license plate wrong thought the worst
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
held them at gunpoint end up shooting
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
for them to get any recourse they had to
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
take their case to the united states
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
because of qualified immunity and the
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
idea that citizens have to take their
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
case in some cases to the u.s supreme
 
01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:00.390 align:start position:0%
case in some cases to the u.s supreme
court

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
to get any redress for egregious
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
misconduct just struck me as wrong
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
and my brother's legal work in that
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
regard which i follow changed my opinion
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
on the breadth of qualified immunity it
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily a terrible idea
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
the idea that police should be immune
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
from certain frivolous lawsuits
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
but the way case law has prevailed has
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
made it over broad
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
and overreaching and foreclosed
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate citizens claims to get
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
civil redress for substantial acts of
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
police misconduct
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i remind and one of the moving
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
things when i was here last week
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
um listening to the testimony before it
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
was moved to this week was
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
to listen to new hampshire police
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
officers talk about their passion for
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
their careers
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
their passion for public safety the idea
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
to that they need to
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
have some leeway to do their jobs well
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm tremendously sympathetic to them
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
i have tremendous admiration for any
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
police officer working in today's
 
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.270 align:start position:0%
police officer working in today's
environment

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
and i have immense respect for the uh uh
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire law enforcement um and
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
this is not to discredit them in any way
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
i do feel that municipalities to train
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
well hire well
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
hold their officers accountable for
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
misconduct set the right standards
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
will not feel an appreciable change
 
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.589 align:start position:0%
will not feel an appreciable change
between

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
the situation that exists now for them
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
and the situation that would exist if
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
you were able to bring
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
civil suit at the state level to get
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
redress for police misconduct
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that having been said thank you for
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh this opportunity to speak and i'd be
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
mr poso yes representative alexander
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you uh mr
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
caposo for taking my question
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
um can you describe a little bit more um
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
reasons why you left the burlington
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
police department
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah i left the burlington police
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
department because when the
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
um when when the city council was a
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
democratic so
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know bernie sanders for example
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
lives in burlington it's a very
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
left-leaning city
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh even as a very progressive police
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
officer i was seen by
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh many people on the far left as some
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
sort of right-leaning so i was a cop i
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
could do no right
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
i had an excellent relationship with the
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
community uh
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
until um the socialists took over the
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
city council when the progressive party
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
which is a socialist party
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
took over the city council they decided
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
to try to disarm my police officers
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
reduce the size of my police department
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
they said that 40
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
of my police officers were domestic
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
abusers and i reacted poorly to that
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
there was a city critic
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
who i trolled on twitter anonymously
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
i was frustrated by the way my cops in
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
the city were being treated by the
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
socialists among us
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
i took on bridge to that and i did what
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
many many many many citizens have done i
 
01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.070 align:start position:0%
many many many many citizens have done i
said

01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
anonymously this is for example um
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
the people who ignore you have
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
antibodies that the rest of us should
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
clone because
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
it would be very valuable to not have to
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
pay attention to a person like you
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
i said that on twitter anonymously when
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
the news found out i first denied it
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
and then i said i will tell the truth
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
the next time i'm asked i did
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
and there was a scandal that a chief of
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
police used twitter to criticize
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
somebody anonymously
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
at that point i was into two interviews
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
to be the police commissioner of
 
01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.950 align:start position:0%
to be the police commissioner of
philadelphia

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
philadelphia
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
i was also on the final interview to be
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
the head of police
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
philanthropy for a major philanthropy
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
organization and my mayor said this is a
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous fight
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
the socialists have their knives out i
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
can invest in your career
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
but you've already applied to other jobs
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
so i resigned
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
does that does that make sense is that
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
um does that answer your question uh
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
it does i just have a quick follow up um
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so um in new hampshire rsa i
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
believe it is
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
if i cite it right hold on i just want
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
to pull the card rsa 31 colon 104
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
it describes a cause of action that
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
citizens can use against a police
 
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.149 align:start position:0%
citizens can use against a police
officer

01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
who quote does wanton or reckless uh
 
01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
who quote does wanton or reckless uh
misconduct

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
so in your uh personal capacity would
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
you qualify that situation with the
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
license plate
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
as a want or reckless uh misconduct
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
police officer that would actually be a
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
cause of action existing in the state
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
no not the license plate per se but the
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
the gunfire
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh you could you could if the person is
 
01:11:08.159 --> 01:11:09.189 align:start position:0%
uh you could you could if the person is
unarmed

01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
unarmed
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
um if the person is standing up that
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's no indication that there's an
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
imminent threat
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
which is again a matter to litigate
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
right i'm not going to go back and
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
litigate on those particular facts
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
but shooting an unarmed person in their
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
own driveway in their own home when
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
there's no weapons in their hand
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
like that could seem like something that
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
would be a cause of action
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative trott here thank you
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
mr deposo a quick question you said you
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
were from vermont did they have
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
qualified i'm going to be there
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
um so no right now vermont there's no
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
when you say they have qualified
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
immunity qualified
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
because we're considering it as a
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
federal uh doctrine
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
so it applies federally if you're asking
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
if they had a state recourse no they
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a state recourse
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from mr
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
del pozo
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
need to raise your hand mr trufsky so we
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman mate can you hear me uh we
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
can hear you
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
you you asked for three minutes mr krebs
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
yes and i'll i'll try to adhere to that
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
to the best i can
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
i'll try to hold you to that good
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
um and members of the committee thank
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to testify
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of the new hampshire
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
police association
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
and we are against the amendment
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons um we
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
initially testified in support of sp 96
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
but if this amendment is adopted we
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
cannot and will not
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
support sb 96 or the amendment
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're against the uh amendment for
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
policy reasons
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
because we believe as it's currently
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
written it will impair contracts
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
in violation of the federal and state
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
constitution three that the
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
um name of the bill of creating a cause
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
of action a cause of action already
 
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.669 align:start position:0%
of action a cause of action already
exists

01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
that it treats public policy public
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
employees disparately not only
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
police officers there are language
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it encourages the proliferation
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
of litigation um i believe that the
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
policy reasons have been articulated
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
um in previous testimony um most among
 
01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
um in previous testimony um most among
them

01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
is the inability of government to
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
conduct itself in a reasonable manner
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
and would
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
deter and there would be a loss of
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
productivity in the operations of
 
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.790 align:start position:0%
productivity in the operations of
government

01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think that the policy reasons are
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
implicitly recognized
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
in this amendment because the amendment
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
actually adopts and retains uh
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
so-called official immunity for
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
judiciary and legislative immunity
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that's at um section 507
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
h4 roman numeral 3 and page
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
it would be also being located on page 2
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
lines 20-22 um it seems to me that the
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment as it's
 
01:14:43.199 --> 01:14:44.310 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment as it's
constituted

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
constituted
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of the policy
 
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.229 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of the policy
considerations

01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
for the legislative and judicial
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
functions but excludes
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are required to
 
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.030 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are required to
enforce

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
those edicts from having any immunity
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
we think that's fundamentally unfair
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
number two we believe that it impairs
 
01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
number two we believe that it impairs
contract

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
um as an illegal impairment of contract
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that the uh justice lynn spoke
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
to that at length
 
01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
but i do point you to section 507
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
h6 which is at page two lines 35-38
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
um in that it specifically says
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
um that notwithstanding any provision of
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
law contract
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
or agreement to the contrary an
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
individual may be
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
fired for a um
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
a violation of any constitutional rights
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
think of the unfairness of this um
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
because in a collective bargaining
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
agreement or other
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh contract that is provided a just
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
cause clause often
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
is contained therein which requires an
 
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.630 align:start position:0%
is contained therein which requires an
employer

01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
to meet a seven-point test it is now
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates that important provision that
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
impairment would be
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
an impairment of the contractual
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
relationships it would impair the
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh relationship and it would be
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
substantial as
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
is recognized by the courts um
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
in that regard for the other reasons
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
stated by judge lynn which i'm
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
trying to go through this quickly to fit
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
within the three minutes
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
the access to the courts already exists
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
i think that was set forth by judge lynn
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
but i also point
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the committee to um
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
507 b which provides for access for
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
bodily injuries for municipalities
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
42 u.s city 1983 for constitutional
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me federal constitutional
 
01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:51.669 align:start position:0%
excuse me federal constitutional
violations

01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
violations
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
and 541b which allows for recovery
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
for uh bad actions of the state in fact
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's recognized
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
um by the uh the bill when it
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
says at the top that it uh it supersedes
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
507b 541b
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
etc um and that's at page one
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through 18.
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
we also believe that it um treats public
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
employees disparately
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
for example it would
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
there is legislative immunity and
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
immunity for judicious actions judiciary
 
01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.709 align:start position:0%
immunity for judicious actions judiciary
actions

01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
actions
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
um contained within the bill or the
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
amendment at 507 h4
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
think about it from this perspective
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's not just police officers
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
but imagine a assistant clerk who's in a
 
01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:44.790 align:start position:0%
but imagine a assistant clerk who's in a
town

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
enforcing a voting rights bill that has
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
been passed
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
operating good faith in trying to
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
enforce the law would create liability
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
for that municipality
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
and possibly the termination of that

unconstitutional
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
that employee is following the
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
directives of the
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%

01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
it actually says that the good faith
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
reliance by the
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
um employee can no longer be used as a
 
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
um employee can no longer be used as a
defense

01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you the language is also
 
01:18:25.199 --> 01:18:26.229 align:start position:0%
thank you the language is also
problematic

01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
can you can you wrap up attorney we we
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
believe the language is problematic
 
01:18:31.199 --> 01:18:31.750 align:start position:0%
believe the language is problematic
because

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
it refers to state agents agents and
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
government agents
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
without a definition of either one which
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
means that this law may be applied
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
apparently on the different levels
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
and um we we also believe
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
that with this would have many negative
 
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.149 align:start position:0%
that with this would have many negative
implications

01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%

thank representative burch i think
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
it was me he was referring to as the nhm
 
01:24:20.159 --> 01:24:20.470 align:start position:0%
it was me he was referring to as the nhm
a

01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
lobbyist who is i think it's he said a
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
kind and thoughtful person
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
um i think he is also a kind and
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
thoughtful person
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh and i probably agree with him more
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
often than i disagree with him
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to uh
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
to sharing our bourbon recipes again
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
when this is over
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
um i do need to correct something he
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
said though
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
he said that the municipal association
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
similarly opposed
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer taxpayer standing bill
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
claiming that it would lead to an
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
explosion of litigation
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
we did not oppose taxpayer standing
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
there were people who did
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh and they did make that claim but we
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
we in fact worked on that we didn't
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
support it but we didn't oppose it
 
01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:08.470 align:start position:0%
support it but we didn't oppose it
either

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to clarify that but
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is different
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh this this really is a problem and
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
and let me be clear about this we do not
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
have any argument with the proposition
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
that government actors
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's police or anyone else ought
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
to be accountable for obvious misconduct
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
and in almost all cases at least in new
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire they already
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
are uh citing a few cases from other
 
01:25:35.679 --> 01:25:36.790 align:start position:0%
are uh citing a few cases from other
states

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't change that and uh note that
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think we've heard from four
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
witnesses other than the uh sponsor in
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
three of whom were from outside new
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
i would encourage the committee to
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
listen to new hampshire voices on this
 
01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:56.390 align:start position:0%
listen to new hampshire voices on this
bill

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
but if you want to pass a law that that
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
does provide more assurance of
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
accountability for bad
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
actors we can get behind that and and
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're even happy to work on it
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh and representative lin suggested the
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
but that's not what this bill does this
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill makes local governments liable
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
for innocent mistakes by good actors
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
and for things that aren't even mistakes
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
just uh differing interpretations of the
 
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.550 align:start position:0%
just uh differing interpretations of the
law

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i could give you uh dozens of
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
examples of situations that
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
where this could come up but i'll i'll
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
i'm the moderator in my town and by the
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
way someone said that this bill protects
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
all elected officials it does not
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
it protects legislative officials but
 
01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
it protects legislative officials but
but

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
not all elected officials so at our town
 
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.669 align:start position:0%
not all elected officials so at our town
meeting

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
somebody gets disruptive so i have a
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
police officer escort him out of the
 
01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.350 align:start position:0%
police officer escort him out of the
building

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
and detain him until the end of the
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
meeting which the law
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
he sues me and he sues the police
 
01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.430 align:start position:0%
he sues me and he sues the police
officer

01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
for violating his first and fourth
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendment rights
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the judge agrees now under current
 
01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.390 align:start position:0%
and the judge agrees now under current
law

01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
these are the kinds of good faith
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
decisions that
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
that the police officer and i would be
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
protected from
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh government actors have to make
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
these decisions
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
decisions every day and they're
 
01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.189 align:start position:0%
decisions every day and they're
protected

01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
but this bill would eliminate that
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
protection yeah i don't get sued
 
01:27:31.199 --> 01:27:32.229 align:start position:0%
protection yeah i don't get sued
personally

01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
but the town is is now subject to
 
01:27:34.719 --> 01:27:35.750 align:start position:0%
but the town is is now subject to
liability

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
for damages and for um
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
attorney fees where i where i and the
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
police officer have just followed
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
a reasonable interpretation of the law
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
as i said i could come up with dozens of
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
other examples and i have in some of my
 
01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.629 align:start position:0%
other examples and i have in some of my
correspondence

01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
correspondence
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
so if there are changes that that need
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
to be made to tighten up the
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
accountability for
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
actual misconduct
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
for intentional misconduct by whether
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
it's police officers or others
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
as i said we're happy to work on that
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
but to take
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
take a sledgehammer to the entire system
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
to get rid of qualified immunity
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
is is not the answer so i very strongly
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
encourage you to uh reject this
 
01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:23.590 align:start position:0%
encourage you to uh reject this
amendment

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:28:32.159 --> 01:28:33.510 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
today

01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me again thank
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
you very much my name is
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
jay schweikert and i am a research
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
fellow with the cato institute
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh and my uh focus for the last three
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
and a half years has been the doctrine
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
of qualified immunity
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
um and that doctrine is obviously at the
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
center of these discussions today but i
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful to provide
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit more background and
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
explanation on exactly
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
how this doctrine works in practice uh
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
and what eliminating it would and would
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
not mean
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
as long as you can do that in the five
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
minutes you've asked absolutely
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely um so the the key
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
feature of qualified immunity that
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
actually hasn't been
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
is the clearly established law standard
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
the way that qualified immunity works is
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
if someone's constitutional
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
rights have been violated um a
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
a plaintiff to get relief for that
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
violation also has to show that that
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
right was quote
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
clearly established at the time of the
 
01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.229 align:start position:0%
clearly established at the time of the
violation

01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
and in practice what that means is that
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
they have to find
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
a prior judicial decision in their
 
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.470 align:start position:0%
a prior judicial decision in their
jurisdiction

01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
with functionally identical facts as
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
their own case
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
what this means is that although we've
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
been discussing concepts like
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
reasonableness and good faith
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh qualified immunity actually has
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with reasonableness or
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
good faith
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
the only thing that matters with this
 
01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:15.910 align:start position:0%
the only thing that matters with this
doctrine

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
doctrine
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
is whether the law was clearly
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
established which again
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
generally means whether there were
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
sufficiently similar facts in prior
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
judicial decisions
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
so just to give a couple examples of
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
this uh in the case
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
jessup versus city of fresno which
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative burch touched on in his
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
opening comments
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh the court granted immunity to
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
officers who were alleged to have stolen
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
over 200 and over 200 000 in cash and
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
rare coins
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
while executing a search warrant uh they
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
received qualified immunity not because
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
they were acting in good faith of course
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
they weren't acting in good
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
faith they received immunity simply
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
because that court had not yet
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
issued a decision addressing that exact
 
01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.070 align:start position:0%
issued a decision addressing that exact
question

01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh similarly in a recent decision called
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
fraser versus evans
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh police officers uh violated the man's
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights by illegally
 
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.430 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights by illegally
searching

01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
searching
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
and threatening to arrest him for
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
recording them in public something that
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
he had a first amendment right to do
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
and these officers had been explicitly
 
01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:13.669 align:start position:0%
and these officers had been explicitly
trained

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
trained
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh that citizens do have a first
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
amendment right
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
to record the police in public they knew
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
they were violating this man's rights
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
but they received immunity because while
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
six of the federal circuit courts had
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
had explicitly addressed this question
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
the one particular court where this
 
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.310 align:start position:0%
the one particular court where this
occurred

01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
the 10th circuit had not so in other
 
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
the 10th circuit had not so in other
words

01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
this doctrine turns entirely on the
 
01:31:36.719 --> 01:31:37.910 align:start position:0%
this doctrine turns entirely on the
happenstance

01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
happenstance
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the fact patterns of prior cases not
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
on whether a defendant was acting
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
reasonably or in good way
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
another misconception of qualified
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
immunity that i want to address
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
is that it has nothing to do with
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
deterring frivolous lawsuits
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
um a frivolous lawsuit by its very
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
nature is one that is not meritorious
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
either whether it's factually
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
unsupported or legally unsupported
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
but qualified immunity only matters it
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
only does work
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
in the instance where someone's rights
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
have been violated
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
but where a court determines that those
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
rights were not clearly established
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
so for qualified immunity to make the
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
difference in a case
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
it must necessarily mean that the case
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
was not frivolous that there was a
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
meritorious claim
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
when cases are genuinely frivolous there
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
are other tools of civil procedure that
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
are perfectly capable of dismissing
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
those suits
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
so whether or not frivolous lawsuits or
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
frivolous civil rights
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits are a problem it's just not
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
something that qualified immunity is
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
geared to address
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
and finally i want to briefly touch on
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
this question of state law remedies
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and just to explain why state law
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
remedies are not an adequate alternative
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
to a robust civil rights law for
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
addressing constitutional violations
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
and there are two main reasons one is
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
simply that uh
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
most state law remedies uh do not
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
include attorneys fees um
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
and now you know uh judge lynn i believe
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know recognized that he might
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
support attorneys fees but
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
more generally without attorneys fees
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
most civil rights plaintiffs are simply
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to bring a case at
 
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.430 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to bring a case at
all

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
but additionally although there is some
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
overlap between state law remedies and
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional violations
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's by no means complete there are all
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of constitutional violations
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
violations of free speech and freedom of
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
religion by uh racial discrimination
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
due pro trial rights uh and many others
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
that simply cannot be redressed through
 
01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:32.629 align:start position:0%
that simply cannot be redressed through
traditional

01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
court law remedies and that's why a
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
robust civil rights law
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
is essential uh and with that i'm happy
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for mr
 
01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.669 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for mr
schweikert

01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
you are there raise your hand so we can
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
well mr bowden good morning
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair person thank you for uh
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony and thank you to the
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
house judiciary committee for allowing
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
me to speak today
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
no problem you asked for two minutes
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be very quick my name is
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
mark beaudoin i'm a retired
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
sergeant from the new hampshire state
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
police i'm currently the executive
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire troopers
 
01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.790 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire troopers
association

01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh we are in support of sb 96 for the
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
lee act
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
but we are against uh the amendment uh
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that is brought forward by
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative burch
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
um we believe that this is a this is a
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
national narrative that is being pushed
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
on the state of
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
lecture i think you've heard many people
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
today testifying they're all from a good
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
chunk of them are from out of state that
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
are in support of this
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is a solution looking for a problem
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
none of them have mentioned any issues
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
that have been going on in new hampshire
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
as to why this
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
desperate change needs to be made
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
we are also experiencing a recruitment
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
and retention issue here
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire with our law
 
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement although we try very hard to
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
recruit the very best
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're finding that to be more and more
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
currently as you heard from a lot of the
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
other people that testified in
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
opposition uh to this amendment
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
bad actors are held accountable there is
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
a way to hold them accountable
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
currently through current law so public
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
employee sectors
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't get 100 immunity all right if they
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
act in a reckless a wanton manner
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
they can be held accountable for civil
 
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
they can be held accountable for civil
suits

01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
this is a uh and speaking as
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
a citizen and as a resident of new
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire i am also concerned about some
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
of the things that the municipalities
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
i pay a hefty property tax already
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
i don't need my taxes going up as a
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
result of this whether it's through
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
insurance costs
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
or lawsuits and as many of you know
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of these lawsuits are settled with
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
nuisance money
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
which will add up after a while and it's
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
the public that will be paying for that
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to reiterate a lot of
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh what was already testified
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
to we are in opposition of this bill we
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
don't feel that this is good for new
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire we don't feel it's right for
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
but we don't see that new hampshire is
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
it currently experiencing a problem with
 
01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.070 align:start position:0%
it currently experiencing a problem with
this

01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that there would be a lot of
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences as a result
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
and with that i thank you for uh
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
and uh if anyone has any questions i'd
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%

leak commission
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i would echo the testimony by my
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
colleague on
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
malachi in opposing this amendment
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
i take no position on the content of the
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
amendment itself
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
but i would just contrast the hearing
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 96 itself where there was
 
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 96 itself where there was
almost

01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh complete unanimity in support of
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
the bill itself with this morning's
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
hearing with the controversy
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment and i think it
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
shameful if we jeopardized the contents
 
01:38:16.719 --> 01:38:17.030 align:start position:0%
shameful if we jeopardized the contents
of

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 96 by trying to attach this

senate bill 96 by trying to attach this
amendment

01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
to it which should which should have its
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
own hearing so
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%

01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%

mr norton for taking my question um
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
would you classify this amendment
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
as a poison pill on the work that the
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
commission did it
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%

representative lynn's suggestion that
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps this should be a study committee
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
i just don't believe that it should be
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
attached to

amendment
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
as you know many communities in new
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire rely on call firefighters as
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
a recent article from the concord
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
monitor highlighted the challenges
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
communities are having
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
to find individuals willing to serve as
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
call firefighters
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
full-time departments are experiencing
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
the same challenges
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
if sb-96 were to become law with the
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
those who are willing to serve their
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
local communities as call firefighters
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
or could those who consider a career in
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
the fire service
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
may decide against doing so to avoid the
 
01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.590 align:start position:0%
may decide against doing so to avoid the
associated

01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
associated
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
new potential for being the subject of a
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
high profile lawsuit
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
which could result in their termination
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire full-time and call fire
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
departments must compete with the
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
private sector
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
for employers as well as departments in
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
creating an environment which makes new
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire less attractive
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
will only exacerbate these problems
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of fire
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
chiefs opposes the approach
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and ask you to do so as well

of this amendment um i do have already
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
started with one request actually based
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
on the testimony have
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
two requests and i know in
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
a u.s supreme court opinion that
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
expanded the the
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
1983 coverage in federal lawsuits
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
a dissent from justice powell that said
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
no one can foresee the number of new
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
filings in our already overburdened
 
01:42:35.199 --> 01:42:35.910 align:start position:0%
filings in our already overburdened
courts

01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
but nobody can doubt the consequences
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
that it will be substantial
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
my first request this relates to the
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
fact that house bill 111 did not have a
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that if this bill is ultimately
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
supported by this committee that would
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
be referred
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
to the lba for this if you want to lie
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
i think it would be useful for the house
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
to have information
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
with regard to the potential fiscal
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
impacts and we certainly do not take a
 
01:43:03.199 --> 01:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
impacts and we certainly do not take a
position

01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
on the policy but we do believe that
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
there will be an increase in the number
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
of lawsuits filed
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that will have an impact on the
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
resources of the court
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
and we would potentially be looking for
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
resources that might cover that either
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
now or down the road so i do think it
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
would be useful and instructive
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
for the legislative branch my second
 
01:43:27.199 --> 01:43:27.750 align:start position:0%
for the legislative branch my second
request

01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
it relates to the testimony and i uh
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
i understand that the the focus of this
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
has been on qualified immunity and i
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
just point to
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
um page 1 lines 30 to 32 of the bill
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
and suggest and again have no policy uh
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
opinion or view on on how this might
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
turn out but suggest perhaps a
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
referral to the attorney general as to
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
the scope of what this means
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
because it does say an individual may
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
seek legal equitable
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
or other relief under this chapter in
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
state court
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
for an injury caused by an agent of the
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire or political
 
01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.070 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire or political
subdivision

01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
in violation of a right under the laws
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
or constitution of the state of new
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire or the united states
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
and i do think it might be useful
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
especially from my perspective in
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
putting together a fiscal note
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not that phrasing
 
01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.590 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not that phrasing
expands

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
expands
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill beyond qualified
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
and again whether or not it does is not
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for your your time i'd
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
our attorney ahead
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
kirk beede
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is kirk biatti i'm
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
the fire chief for the city of laconia
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm also the first vice president
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire association of
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm here speaking in opposition to
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment for senate bill 96.
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
as chief seatar stated uh the new
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of fire chiefs did
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
send out a letter
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh um in our opposition
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
i just want to make a couple quick
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
points i know it's been a long morning
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to keep it very very short for
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to protect i think
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
these are two key points number one is
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to protect
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
nor do we support reckless and wanton
 
01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.510 align:start position:0%
nor do we support reckless and wanton
actions

01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
actions
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
what we do want to ensure is that
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
firefighters emts
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
and agencies we oversee both an
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
emergency and a non-emergency response
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
are not subject to unnecessary
 
01:45:49.119 --> 01:45:50.550 align:start position:0%
are not subject to unnecessary
litigation

01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that the current new
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire laws strikes that right
 
01:45:54.239 --> 01:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire laws strikes that right
balance

01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
balance
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
i told you i'd keep it very short i
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
think those are key points
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your time this morning
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chief are there any
 
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.550 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chief are there any
questions

01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%

thank you again thank you the
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%

good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%

fine
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you my name is uh tom mullins
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
thomas mullins i'm the city attorney
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the city of keene uh speaking on
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of our city council who
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
asked me to attend the meeting i did ask
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
for three minutes and i promise there
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
will be three
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
real people minutes and not lawyer
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
minutes as a bailiff once said to me
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
keep it short um in short uh yeah i'm in
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
favor of the testimony that you've heard
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
in opposition to
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh in particular uh
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
lynn representative lin's comment
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know respective respected first in
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
the state and
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
these comments were right on a couple of
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
real world applications for you first we
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
think it's the
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
amendment sweeps way too broadly you've
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
heard those comments that
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the police
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
officers who have a terrible and
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
difficult job it's not just directed at
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
the police officers it applies to all
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
of our employees and in a couple of real
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
world consequences
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
for example we now have a lot of rsa 91a
 
01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.310 align:start position:0%
for example we now have a lot of rsa 91a
requests

01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
91a is a statute that arises under our
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
so it is a sort of constitutional right
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's provided
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
our supreme court uh recently decided
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
that personnel records and files
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh are no longer sort of per se exempt
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
so we have to do a privacy analysis to
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
make a determination as to
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not those files should be
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
released uh if we
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
are wrong uh and guess wrong and the jur
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
the judge uh decides that
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
we were wrong then uh potentially there
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
was a violation of a law that arises
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
from a constitutional right committed by
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
a city agent uh which would make that
 
01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:08.149 align:start position:0%
a city agent uh which would make that
individual

01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh not the individual libel but the
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
municipality libel so
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh that we think that just sweeps too
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
broadly uh the second point i'd like to
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
make is
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked a lot about the
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
1983 action qualified immunity
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
this is a state law that we're talking
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
about but it doesn't prevent a plaintiff
 
01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:24.229 align:start position:0%
about but it doesn't prevent a plaintiff
from

01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
going into federal court uh seeking 1983
 
01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
going into federal court uh seeking 1983
damages

01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
damages
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
against the individual agent even though
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
the state law does not provide
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
for that so we would urge you at this
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
point to
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh to not uh to itl
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment um i'm also finally
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
not going to say to you that we don't
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
think that there are some issues with
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity you've heard some of
 
01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:46.229 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity you've heard some of
those

01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
already those probably need to be
 
01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.350 align:start position:0%
already those probably need to be
addressed

01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
i work with very professional people who
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
are very well trained
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
but we all make mistakes and basically
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is punish state
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
city employees for making good faith
 
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:00.709 align:start position:0%
city employees for making good faith
mistakes

01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%

01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
on this important underlying bill
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
sb96 my name is matthew broadhead i'm a
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
senior assistant attorney general
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
here at the department of justice i am
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
the bureau chief of the transportation
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
bureau um but i'm actually appearing
 
01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.910 align:start position:0%
bureau um but i'm actually appearing
today

01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the attorney general john
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
carmella and all state agencies
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
and we do oppose the
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh amendment we do support the
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
sb96 the original language was based on
 
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:14.870 align:start position:0%
sb96 the original language was based on
consensus

01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
this inserts uh a issue that's
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
non-germane to what was trying to be
 
01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.709 align:start position:0%
non-germane to what was trying to be
accomplished

01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
by the original language of sd 96
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
i can't overstate that the original bill
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
was built on consensus
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
and had included support from the law
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement community as well as
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
community stakeholders
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
and uh this kind of risks torpedoing
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
what uh progress we can make um on
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
police reform and needed transparency
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
um so we oppose on that ground uh we
 
01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:49.990 align:start position:0%
um so we oppose on that ground uh we
also

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
without taking a position on the
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
overarching policy
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
we do oppose the language of the
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
amendment because
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
it uh i think a
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
previous person testified that it takes
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
a sledgehammer
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
we think you know it takes a hatchet to
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
our statutory scheme
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
where a scalpel would be more
 
01:51:09.679 --> 01:51:11.109 align:start position:0%
where a scalpel would be more
appropriate

01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
um and and if i i don't want to echo
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
you know you know or repeat what's
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
already been discussed but we also
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
share the same concerns that justin lynn
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
former justice lynn representative right
 
01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.750 align:start position:0%
former justice lynn representative right
now

01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
had testified to in terms of qualified
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
immunity as a creature of federal law
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
there are other immunities under state
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
law that are
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
that this bill would appear to override
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i just going to list them off
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
because they're found in rsa
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
541b and rsa 99d
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
and if the members of the committee are
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
not familiar with these
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
immunities that would now be waived then
 
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.229 align:start position:0%
immunities that would now be waived then
i

01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
recommend this issue for further study
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that you can familiarize yourself
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
with these issues to determine whether
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
or not uh as a matter of policy you
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
would want to waive them
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
they include discretionary function
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
immunity recreational community
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial community do care immunity
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh those are that's that's a a statute
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
that says that state employee can't be
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
liable if they're
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
exercising due care in the and
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
exercising their statutorily obligated
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
functions which you all set
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
um intentional toward immunity eleventh
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendment immunity this would wave
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh 11th amendment immunity that the
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
state enjoys
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
in federal court which basically serve
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
as a buttress that
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
any claims against the state
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
are not decided by a federal judge in
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
federal court
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're decided by state judges and
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
state courts closer to the community
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
that we serve
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's an important policy decision to
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
make so if you're not familiar with the
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
issues i think
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
commend that for further study um
 
01:52:59.199 --> 01:52:59.910 align:start position:0%
commend that for further study um
further

01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh now rsa99d gives the state the option
 
01:53:02.639 --> 01:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
uh now rsa99d gives the state the option
to

01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not to uh represent a state
 
01:53:06.239 --> 01:53:06.870 align:start position:0%
whether or not to uh represent a state
employee

01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
who's acted recklessly or wanted
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
in in with regard to their duties
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that does create personal
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
accountability for
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh state employees if they are wet one
 
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:21.910 align:start position:0%
uh state employees if they are wet one
or

01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
or reckless and uh
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
therefore the the um
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a perverse effect waving
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
that would have a perverse effect in
 
01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.350 align:start position:0%
that would have a perverse effect in
that

01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
those uh employees are free to do what
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
they want
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
and knowing that they'll be fully
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
defended and indemnified
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
um so that i think is concerning there's
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
also a statutory cap
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
on damages with respect to the state so
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
that the budget doesn't get impacted by
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
a flood of
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
claims there's a 500 475
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
000 cap on damages so it doesn't affect
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh the bottom line or the functioning of
 
01:54:01.599 --> 01:54:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh the bottom line or the functioning of
government

01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
um this would wait so
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's other drafting issues uh but
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that i'm happy to
 
01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:11.270 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that i'm happy to
take

01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
questions um i i do if i may
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair just want to correct one this
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh perception about what qualified
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
immunity is in federal court um
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
there was a somebody from the cato
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
institute who i think misquoted
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
the case law in the first circuit which
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
is governed with governs new hampshire
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
you don't need to prove that there's a
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
spitting image case that's a
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's a case it's called velcido v
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
decker the case that i argued at the
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
first circuit
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
and you don't to to to prevail on
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity you don't need to
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
show that there's a case a prior case on
 
01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:46.870 align:start position:0%
show that there's a case a prior case on
point

01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
um that's exactly factually the same
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
you they don't general they don't
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
generalize it that
 
01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:57.070 align:start position:0%
at that level of specific specificity
 
01:54:57.070 --> 01:54:58.470 align:start position:0%
at that level of specific specificity
[Music]

01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
you just you don't need to show that
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's a spitting image
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
it protects all but the plainly
 
01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:05.589 align:start position:0%
it protects all but the plainly
incompetent

01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
incompetent
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
or those who act intentionally so it
 
01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:09.109 align:start position:0%
or those who act intentionally so it
protects

01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
protects
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
officers who make bad guesses in gray
 
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:12.629 align:start position:0%
officers who make bad guesses in gray
areas

01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
not intentional or incompetent
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
so that that's all uh i'll leave it at
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
that and i'm having to take any
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%

testimony

01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
again that includes the people who
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
pre-registered to testify
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
today there are some hands up i see
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
there are four hands up
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
one no name no last name but
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
yes nice to have it it's nice to have a
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
unique name
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
um i apologize for not i didn't think
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'd have a chance to testify this
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
morning giving hearings
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
going on in the senate um
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
as i said last week in the hearing on
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill i think that there
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
significant problem if this
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
amendment were attached to senate bill
 
01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.310 align:start position:0%
amendment were attached to senate bill
96

01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
96
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
and come over to the senate not having
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
had the chance to have a hearing
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem i agree with the
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
testimony of many witnesses
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
i've only heard a few of them but i in
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
particular agree with
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
the points articulated by cordell
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
johnson of the municipal association
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
that what the amendment tries to do
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
is solve a problem that does not exist
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there's no identified
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire problem i think you've
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
heard significant testimony about the
 
01:56:53.199 --> 01:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
heard significant testimony about the
stress

01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
stress
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
that it would place through unnecessary
 
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.109 align:start position:0%
that it would place through unnecessary
litigation

01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
on all new hampshire towns but in
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
particular on the people that protect us
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
our police and our firefighters so i
 
01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:05.350 align:start position:0%
our police and our firefighters so i
hope

01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%

01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%

01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
been said today
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
and what i would like to just kind of
 
01:58:03.119 --> 01:58:03.910 align:start position:0%
and what i would like to just kind of
emphasize

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
is this when new hampshire
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
um responded to events that were
 
01:58:09.599 --> 01:58:10.229 align:start position:0%
um responded to events that were
happening

01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
um around the country we looked
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
um at making new hampshire law
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement kind of the leaders
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
and in transparency and training and
 
01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.430 align:start position:0%
and in transparency and training and
accountability

01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
i will just echo that we we met for 26
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
times and when you use the word
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
consensus we listened to the public
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
we had a a diverse group on that
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
league commission we worked very hard
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we reached consensus on
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
48 items that i think really move us
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
forward in training community engagement
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
accountability hiring issues recruitment
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
i mean we looked at this thing
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
and we worked very hard i oppose this
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
because although i support the sb 96 and
 
01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
all that's in it
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
i want to see us continue to move
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
forward when we act ended
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
to this day we continue to work very
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
hard on implementing those changes
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
improving the training improving how we
 
01:59:09.119 --> 01:59:09.910 align:start position:0%
improving the training improving how we
hire

01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
hire
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh and just making positive movement on
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
the lee act recommendations so
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh not only um as as commissioner's
 
01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:18.149 align:start position:0%
uh not only um as as commissioner's
safety

01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
but as a member of the league community
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
i oppose this
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
um i think there are other opportunities
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
just to study this
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue but i do not want to
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
put us backwards and i think that's what
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
this would do
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to answer any question
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
allowing me to raise my hand and jump in
 
01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:38.709 align:start position:0%
allowing me to raise my hand and jump in
judge

01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%

thank you commissioner yes
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative trottier
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um commissioner quinn
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
just one quick question
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire started seeing a
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
problem across the country
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying the hampshire took a
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
proactive approach
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
to deal with these type of issues in new
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire before they started to happen
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
i i believe we did and um i think that
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
if i would encourage everyone to look at
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
the the document
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
what what leaked looked at we addressed
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
and i think we're forward-leaning and
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
quite honestly i i think we have a great
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
culture that recognizes mistakes
 
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh do occur but we need to
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh provide the best training the best
 
02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh provide the best training the best
resources

02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and and i will say this there are
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
challenges today that you know i did not
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
face when i get hired in 1985 as a state
 
02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
face when i get hired in 1985 as a state
trooper

02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
trooper
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
and we have to continually improve and
 
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.510 align:start position:0%
and we have to continually improve and
enhance

02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
enhance
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
and that is what the leact commission
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
did and and i would say yes and i would
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
put that
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
you know that that that product you know
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
up against anything that's been done and
 
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:45.510 align:start position:0%
up against anything that's been done and
i

02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
i encourage everybody to read it and
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
once you read that you will understand
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
there are great things that have been
 
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
there are great things that have been
happening

02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
are happening and we are moving in the
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
one quick question yes um
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner if this amendment passes
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
and becomes law
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
do you see this affecting the safety
 
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
um in new hampshire
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely and and i'll just
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'll keep it as
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
as simple as this it is getting it is
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
getting very hard to recruit
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
and retain the best and we have not
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
lowered our standards
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think we have to continue uh to
 
02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:27.990 align:start position:0%
i think we have to continue uh to
support

02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
our first responders to support them
 
02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:31.189 align:start position:0%
our first responders to support them
address

02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes that have been made be
 
02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:34.310 align:start position:0%
mistakes that have been made be
transparent

02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
but without that support quite honestly
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
you you're not going to see the interest
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and and that's that's uh uh
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussed nationally i mean that that's
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
happening all over the country

to the amendment to senate bill 96 in
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
a bill which i originally worked on as
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
part of the leak legislative work group
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
which as introduced by representative
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
burch will eliminate qualified immunity
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
and official immunity in the state of
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire although it is clear that
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
the focus of this bill
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
is directed at law enforcement the
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
abolition of qualified and official
 
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.750 align:start position:0%
abolition of qualified and official
immunity

02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
will extend to many other dedicated men
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
and women serving within the public
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
service professions in the state
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
on friday of last week as i have for
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
many years
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
i had the honor of spending the morning
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire law enforcement
 
02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.350 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire law enforcement
memorial

02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
memorial
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
located just outside the building in
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
which many of you sit
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
as i listen to the solemn remembrances
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the 50 names etched into the granite
 
02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.310 align:start position:0%
of the 50 names etched into the granite
columns

02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
columns
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
i thought about the incredible
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
sacrifices that these individuals
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
and their families have made to the
 
02:03:41.679 --> 02:03:43.189 align:start position:0%
and their families have made to the
state

02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
they represent the finest that the law
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement and corrections
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
professions have to offer as they made
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
the ultimate
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
ultimate sacrifice to preserve the
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
safety that each of us enjoys
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
in reflecting on these sacrifices i
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
could not help
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
but consider the events that have
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
occurred over the past year
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
where we have seen this ongoing dialogue
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
and conversation
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
about the proper role of police and
 
02:04:10.239 --> 02:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
about the proper role of police and
society

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
society
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that the profession i
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
love is not without fault
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
i want to make that very clear but i'm
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
quite certain
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
that we can all agree this is true of
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
every profession on this planet
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
wesson dunn who's a retired fbi agent i
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
think eloquently said
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
and described policing by saying this
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
our society expects a lot from officers
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
we expect them to confront potentially
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous individuals
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
so many others do not have to do so we
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
expect them to deal with horrific scenes
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
that would give most people nightmares
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
we expect them to react with unwavering
 
02:04:47.599 --> 02:04:48.629 align:start position:0%
we expect them to react with unwavering
compassion

02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
compassion
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
and understanding when dealing with
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
people experience
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
the worst moments of their life
 
02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.270 align:start position:0%
the worst moments of their life
regardless

02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
of the officer's own life stresses we
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
expect them to react calmly and
 
02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:00.950 align:start position:0%
expect them to react calmly and
professionally

02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
professionally
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
when confronted with verbal and
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes physical abuse
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
we literally expect them to run towards
 
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
the sound of gunfire
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
while others are running away police
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
officers live
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
up to these expectations every day and
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
this is most
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
certainly affirmed as you look at the
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
names of the courageous
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
individuals etched into the wall of the
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement memorial
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
today you have heard from individuals
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
who are passionate
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
and either their support for or their
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to the amendment
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
those who support the amendment will
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
argue that qualified and official
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
immunity essentially says
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
that police officers and other public
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
servants are above the law
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
although i pose this amendment what is
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
most important for you to understand
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
is the impact of the removal of
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
qualified and official
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
immunity there is no doubt that policing
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
in the united states must continue to
 
02:05:58.079 --> 02:05:58.950 align:start position:0%
in the united states must continue to
improve

02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
improve
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
to better reflect the expectations of
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
our changing society
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
in considering police reform we must
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
balance the impact
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
and potentially negative consequences of
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
such effort
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
it is not true to say that qualified and
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
official immunity prevents
 
02:06:15.119 --> 02:06:16.310 align:start position:0%
official immunity prevents
accountability

02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
for police misconduct and to the
 
02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:19.669 align:start position:0%
for police misconduct and to the
contrary

02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
it protects both society and law
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement in a carefully balanced
 
02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
enforcement in a carefully balanced
manner

02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
that has been refined by the courts over
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
many years it permits officers to
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
perform their duties without
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
fear of constantly defending themselves
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
against tenuous claims
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
and it allows the public to recover
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
damages when a reasonable
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
officer would know that their conduct
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
violates a person's constitutional
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
or legal rights make no mistakes law
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement is a difficult profession
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
with many challenges and risks as well
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
as significant
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
intangible rewards law officers often
 
02:06:55.599 --> 02:06:56.149 align:start position:0%
intangible rewards law officers often
make

02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
split second life or death decision
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
where any hesitation can result in
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
serious injury or death
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
we rightfully expect a lot of law
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of law enforcement officers
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
because we entrust them
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
with significant power and in authority
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
however we should not expect them to be
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
injured or killed while doing their job
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
nor should we expect them to put their
 
02:07:19.679 --> 02:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
nor should we expect them to put their
livelihoods

02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
livelihoods
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the financial welfare of their
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
families on the line every time they are
 
02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:24.950 align:start position:0%
families on the line every time they are
forced

02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
forced
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
to make a split-second life-or-death
 
02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.470 align:start position:0%
to make a split-second life-or-death
decision

02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
in closing i remind you that the laws
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
are the fabric of a civil
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
society we entrust law enforcement
 
02:07:36.079 --> 02:07:36.870 align:start position:0%
society we entrust law enforcement
officers

02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
with the power to uphold and enforce
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
those laws
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers keep the fabric
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
of our society from being torn apart
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
by those who have no respect for others
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
if you pass this amendment
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
eliminating qualified and official
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
immunity you will do nothing more than
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
make an already difficult and
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
challenging profession
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
even more dangerous and complicated
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
and this is my closing statement there
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
is no better reminder
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
reminder of these dangers than those
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
granite slabs
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%

02:10:11.199 --> 02:10:12.950 align:start position:0%
and i think what we will do is take a
recess

02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
recess
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh what i'd like to do i i think uh
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
take a lunch i think we probably can
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
take a recess come back and finish up uh
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%

that's okay with everybody and so
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh it being about quarter past
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%

30.

um could you tell me real fast how to do
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
do you have um just a cell phone number
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
for someone
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative alexander representative
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
gordon mclean
 
02:11:47.250 --> 02:11:47.260 align:start position:0%
oh okay um

oh okay um
[Music]

02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think who just their cell
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
phone numbers
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
that that's what i would recommend since
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're kind of on the fly we don't
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
facilitate um caucuses party caucuses
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
darn i'd like to hear what's being said
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
but yeah i don't i
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have a whole lot of people's
 
02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:07.830 align:start position:0%
i don't have a whole lot of people's
numbers

02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.840 --> 02:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
hey

02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
might i inquire before we get started
 
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
whether there are any other amendments
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh that the committee might be
 
02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh that the committee might be
considering

02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
considering
 
02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh no i believe that their uh
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
well the committee was presented with
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
four potential
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
amendments there was the amendment that
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
you proposed the one that we just heard
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that was proposed
 
02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:04.550 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that was proposed
by

02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo and there were
 
02:29:07.439 --> 02:29:08.230 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo and there were
two

02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
amendments that were proposed by
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative alexander or not proposed
 
02:29:14.319 --> 02:29:14.630 align:start position:0%
representative alexander or not proposed
but

02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
right that's what i thought so
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
i assume one way or the other those will
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
be disposed of
 
02:29:31.030 --> 02:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
in any event i'll call the house
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee back to order
 
02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're here at this point in time for
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%

02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%

02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to implicit bias
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%

on the bill itself last week and we had
 
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
a hearing today on a non-journey
 
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
amendment this morning and
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
i think since we had the hearing this
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%

02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%

i would like to just speak very briefly
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%

go ahead representative birch thank you
um

02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
you all know how i feel built so far
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of debate i want to just
 
02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:24.469 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of debate i want to just
clarify

02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
one or two things that were brought up
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
this morning one is the difference
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
between good faith and reasonability
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
anybody can claim good faith which is
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
why the courts
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
tend not to utilize that in
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh bills there were laws such as this
 
02:31:49.270 --> 02:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
i can say uh i put my foot on somebody's
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
neck until they were dead but
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
i thought i was doing the right thing
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
let me off the hook i was acting in good
 
02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:56.309 align:start position:0%
let me off the hook i was acting in good
faith

02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
faith
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fly the
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to act in a reasonable manner
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
is the standard that the u.s supreme
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
court has handed down that's reflected
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to separate
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh good faith which is not a workable
 
02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.190 align:start position:0%
uh good faith which is not a workable
concept

02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
concept
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
with reasonability which is uh
 
02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
secondly we we heard a lot
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
about two or three major topic areas
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
one had to do with cost and i think to
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
put it baldly
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
no pun intended but to put it boldly um
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the costs
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
to recompense individuals who have been
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
harmed by government action
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
and there's something fundamentally
 
02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:52.070 align:start position:0%
and there's something fundamentally
flawed

02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
flawed
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
by saying oh we shouldn't have to pay
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
those costs
 
02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to incur costs if
 
02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
people were harmed by the government
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should operate that way
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we should so
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
costs are directly related to bad acting
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
and that's the next point i wanted to
 
02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
quickly make
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking here only about bad actors
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's not more complicated than that
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're told two conflicting arguments
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
we're told on one hand there will be
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
huge consequences
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
if we eliminate qualified immunity in
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know people are going to get sued
 
02:33:50.950 --> 02:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
left and right nobody is going to
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
join departments um towns
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
taxes are going to go up every horrible
 
02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:58.790 align:start position:0%
taxes are going to go up every horrible
imaginable

02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
imaginable
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
then we're also told there's no problem
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
both of those cannot exist in the same
 
02:34:06.399 --> 02:34:08.389 align:start position:0%
both of those cannot exist in the same
universe

02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
universe
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
because if there are really no problems
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
then costs are not going to go up
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
if there are all of a sudden in a
 
02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
particular police department
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of suits maybe somebody needs to
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
pay attention to why there
 
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
are in that particular police department
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
but you can't say that there's no
 
02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:33.270 align:start position:0%
but you can't say that there's no
problem

02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
and if we allow victims to sue
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
then um this guy is going to fall in
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
and the last comment i wanted to make is
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
the issue of transparency we heard a
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
whole lot of patting ourselves
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire over the show over on
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
our shoulders
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
about how transparent we are and how
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
transparent we're working
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
um no or not
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have legislation a
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
number of areas
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't have transparency
 
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
we keep bad police officers on the force
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and don't take my word
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
we have a lorry list now
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
we can't see yet and maybe in our
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
lifetime we will
 
02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
but uh we don't know all the names on
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
the lorry list but we know for a
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
fact that we keep bad cops
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
secondly when bad cops
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
who are on the job act badly
 
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is about
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the third leg of this tripod is
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
if there is a settlement
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
then in new hampshire we we bar
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
the harmed citizen from
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
talking about it and and the bad
 
02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
conduct through non-disclosure
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement agreements
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
so by the time you put all three of
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
those together
 
02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should be going around
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
patting ourselves on the back
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
about how transparent we are in new
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire because
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're not so this bill is an attempt
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
to simply say it's not as complicated
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
as most of these witnesses would put it
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
this simply says that the victims
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
of government misconduct
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
it was violation who had suffered a
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
violation of the constitutional rights
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
shall have a right to go to court
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
and get redress exactly what our
 
02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:01.030 align:start position:0%
and get redress exactly what our
constitution

02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
has said since the 1700s
 
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you the other discussion on the
 
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed yes representative
 
02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:13.349 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed yes representative
alexander

02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
alexander
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i have much
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
respect for manchester
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
he presents this amendment as a change
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
or some changes from hb111
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
but the house table that earlier this
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
year and to be clear
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
i really don't think there is much
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
change amendment 1244 stems from a
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
national narrative that doesn't fit with
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that is highlighted by the out of
 
02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
the amount of out-of-state supported
 
02:37:35.439 --> 02:37:36.309 align:start position:0%
the amount of out-of-state supported
deaths

02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
most witnesses testify and support our
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
out-of-state special interest groups
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
who failed to supply one single new
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire example of existing rsa is not
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
being accurate enough and yikes
 
02:37:49.030 --> 02:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
we have almost 1200 people that signed
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this minute
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
in fact one witness in favor of this
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
amendment was forced to resign
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
after a series of social media posts
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
that were initially denied
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
and i would remind the committee that
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
that denial of wrongdoing
 
02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
is a reason placed on our lord list in
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this amendment argues
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
that addition of the use of force
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
language at the end of the amendment
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
would help address some of the concerns
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
raised during the session last month
 
02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
i would argue it doesn't do enough there
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
are already causes of actions for when
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
officials act
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
in quote wanton or reckless mayor the
 
02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association has
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
outlined this in their letter to this
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee dated on march 1st
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
in which they describe the existing
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
avenue in place which addresses
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
personal and individual liability of
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
government employees
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
employees would only be shielded from
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuit liability if they believed their
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
conduct was lawful
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
and within the scope of the officers or
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
employees official duties
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
wanting a reckless misconduct would not
 
02:38:48.479 --> 02:38:49.590 align:start position:0%
wanting a reckless misconduct would not
qualify

02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
so the description by one witness has a
 
02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
shooting of an unarmed citizen in a
 
02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:54.550 align:start position:0%
shooting of an unarmed citizen in a
driveway

02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
driveway
 
02:38:57.270 --> 02:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
by a police officer in my mind in most
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
minds would qualify as
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
quote one or reckless misconduct
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
i tabled hb 111 earlier this session in
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
order to give the sponsor time to fix
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
some major concerns
 
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of the new hampshire house
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
had before delivering another copy of
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
there has been additional language
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
changes offered by constitutional law
 
02:39:16.479 --> 02:39:17.110 align:start position:0%
changes offered by constitutional law
experts

02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
experts
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
and other state reps hoping to fix the
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
concerns by many in the house last month
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
amendment 1244 does not address the
 
02:39:26.710 --> 02:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
major concerns of hp111
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
and this issue should never have been
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
introduced again this year the new
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire house has already spoken
 
02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
sb-96 is an attempt to bring all groups
 
02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:35.830 align:start position:0%
sb-96 is an attempt to bring all groups
together

02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
um to come up with sense solutions to
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
enhance law enforcement accountability
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
there are many things i like in sb96
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
however if 1244 is added to sb96 i
 
02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
cannot support the bill
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
i want to warn the committee that adding
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
amendment 1244 to sb96 would simply
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
disrupt months of conversation and
 
02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:54.469 align:start position:0%
disrupt months of conversation and
compromise

02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
02:39:57.270 --> 02:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
made by the lia committee so in that way
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
i urge my colleagues to
 
02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
support the bipartisan nature of sp 96
 
02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
and please vote no on 1244 thank you
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair mr chair i
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
was and remain a very proud
 
02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of house bill
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
1 11. i believe
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
that the issue that was addressed in
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 111
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
is relevant and important
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
be ignored i was not
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
shocked this morning but was
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
in fact disappointed by the ad hominem
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
arguments that were presented
 
02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
including arguments that had absolutely
 
02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:01.190 align:start position:0%
including arguments that had absolutely
nothing

02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
at all to do with the proposal of
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
amendment 12 44.
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
the sky is not falling and would
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
not fall um uh
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
the scare tactics were i thought
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
um irresponsible on the part of
 
02:41:27.550 --> 02:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
public employees and those who were
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
representing certain
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
interest groups there is nothing
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
that we can do about frivolous law
 
02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:38.309 align:start position:0%
that we can do about frivolous law
school

02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
suits those of us on judiciary know that
 
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits are going to be filed
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
no matter what
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're frivolous means
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
are not they do not continue
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
through the judicial process and this
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
legislation or this amendment does not
 
02:41:58.399 --> 02:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
legislation or this amendment does not
increase

02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
that um the lack of respect
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
that was shown this morning by
 
02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh those who testified against this
 
02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:11.590 align:start position:0%
uh those who testified against this
amendment

02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh comments that would indicate that
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
responsible public employees would no
 
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
longer be responsible
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
but would turn their backs or sit you
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
know on their hands
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
i found that insulting to all
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
all public employees
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
i sent to this committee um a week or so
 
02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:38.070 align:start position:0%
i sent to this committee um a week or so
ago

02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:42:41.590 --> 02:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
something that came from my town from
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
the town of durham
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh in which you all got to read about
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
what a careful well-run responsible
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
police department
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
that has achieved clear recognition
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
does and i insist that the town of
 
02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
durham would have nothing to worry about
 
02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
because it's careful about
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
who it hires it provides supervision it
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
provides training it provides
 
02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:11.830 align:start position:0%
provides training it provides
accountability

02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless my town
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
manager who is uh
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
quite a responsible individual swallowed
 
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
whole hog
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
the um the information that he was given
 
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
by the municipal association and i guess
 
02:43:33.269 --> 02:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's understandable the town spends a
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
um to the municipal association so
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're not going to walk away
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
all of this would cause me
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
under all circumstances to support
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 111 as i did and still do
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
and to support amendment
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
12 44.
 
02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
however i
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
find myself troubled
 
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
by the fact that
 
02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes this is the right pew
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
but i believe it's the wrong church
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
i think that the language in the
 
02:44:18.319 --> 02:44:19.750 align:start position:0%
i think that the language in the
amendment

02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
is something that i support and i and i
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
will work
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
hard to pursue
 
02:44:31.429 --> 02:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
but i think that the work that has gone
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
on in lee act has to be
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
respected a very strong argument could
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
be made
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
that there is so much support for leaked
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
that if this amendment were added it
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
would not in any way
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
compromise uh or or question
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
or put into jeopardy the passage of the
 
02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
however all of us have seen
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
in this session any number of bills
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
where irrational illogical
 
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
ad hominem arguments ended up
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
compromising the success of bills that
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
should have passed
 
02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
therefore i cannot tell you how great my
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
reluctance is
 
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
i cannot tell you how great my sadness
 
02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:25.190 align:start position:0%
i cannot tell you how great my sadness
is

02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
but legislating responsible is a
 
02:45:30.309 --> 02:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
complicated issue
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
and in no way do i question this
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
my support and i hope no one questions
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
my support of the elimination of
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity but i
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
am very reluctantly going to vote
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
against the amendment and i will be
 
02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:50.309 align:start position:0%
against the amendment and i will be
voting

02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the underlying bill with
 
02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
the hope that we will add back to that
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
underlying bill a section that for some
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
unexplainable reason the senate removed
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
because i want to be absolutely
 
02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:07.670 align:start position:0%
because i want to be absolutely
consistent

02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
in supporting the work of leak and that
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
would include
 
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
putting back in the one section that the
 
02:46:16.389 --> 02:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
senate removed
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for indulging me with this
 
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
over long statement
 
02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair any
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
other comments yes representative sylvia
 
02:46:31.750 --> 02:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh i agree
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
with my
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
former chairwoman uh right up until her
 
02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:37.830 align:start position:0%
former chairwoman uh right up until her
conclusions

02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
conclusions
 
02:46:42.469 --> 02:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
she made numerous fantastic points
 
02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of fear
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
surrounding this issue
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't let fear control my life
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
i use it as a way to inform myself
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
but when it comes down to the end i have
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
to weigh
 
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
the rational arguments i believe that
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the state
 
02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
is doing a fine job and that
 
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
there will not be a swarm of
 
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against law enforcement further
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's not just about law enforcement
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
let's let's not forget that this is
 
02:47:18.830 --> 02:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
about all
 
02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:26.150 align:start position:0%
about all
employees

02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.349 --> 02:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
and then while i was not on the leac
 
02:47:33.030 --> 02:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
commission i appreciate all the great
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
work that they did
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think this is actually instead of a
 
02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
poison pill
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
an enhancement for who we act in that
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's a statement that says yes we trust
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
our police officers we know we're not
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to get sued
 
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
and it's an enhancement to we act
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
good things that they're trying to do so
 
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
i think actually sb 96
 
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
without this amendment would be lesser
 
02:48:11.269 --> 02:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
and it would be more difficult to vote
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
for because it's not complete
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
without this so i'm supporting this
 
02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:16.230 align:start position:0%
without this so i'm supporting this
amendment

02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
and if this amendment passes then i will
 
02:48:19.359 --> 02:48:19.670 align:start position:0%
and if this amendment passes then i will
be

02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
supporting sb96
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
as amended thank you
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
02:48:34.710 --> 02:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you all know that i
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
supported hb 111
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
and reforms to qualified immunity and
 
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
any incentive to hire and train
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
employees in a professional manner
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
and to hold them to a high standard but
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
with all respect to my colleagues
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this amendment
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm disinclined to support it today
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
sb96 as it came from our partner
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
legislative body consists of the reforms
 
02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
that the liat commission came to
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
agreement on
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
i don't want to jeopardize the package
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
of legislation containing these
 
02:49:04.630 --> 02:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
necessary reforms
 
02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:06.800 align:start position:0%

from the stakeholders
 
02:49:14.389 --> 02:49:14.399 align:start position:0%

about reforms to qualified immunity
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%

and in closing i would like to say yoga
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
yogi berra said if you don't know where
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
you are going you will end up somewhere
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
else that is how i feel about the need
 
02:55:19.110 --> 02:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
for data collection
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to comment on
 
02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment yes
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
 
02:55:31.590 --> 02:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
um yes just wanted to say um i mean
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
during the uh
 
02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
earlier debate we had a number of law
 
02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement um
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
officials paint a rosy picture of the uh
 
02:55:40.469 --> 02:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
relationship between our law enforcement
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
community and those
 
02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
those they serve and it certainly is
 
02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
better than other places but we have um
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
we have the same problems um we have
 
02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
the same problems that uh every every
 
02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
other part of the country does so i
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
think uh this
 
02:55:58.950 --> 02:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh data collection is uh is necessary
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
in order to uh you know as i said we
 
02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the problem is if we
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't uh don't know what the problem is
 
02:56:08.469 --> 02:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
um so probably yogi berra said it better
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
so i support
 
02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair mr chairman uh i
 
02:56:16.479 --> 02:56:16.870 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair mr chairman uh i
am

02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
generally opposed and in this case the
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
collection of
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity and other types of
 
02:56:24.550 --> 02:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
data such as that i think that's uh
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
totally against the way the american
 
02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:27.910 align:start position:0%
totally against the way the american
system

02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:56:30.870 --> 02:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
works we are supposed to be colorblind
 
02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:31.269 align:start position:0%
works we are supposed to be colorblind
and

02:56:31.269 --> 02:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to gather data to
 
02:56:35.190 --> 02:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
find out that we're in some percentage
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
02:56:40.150 --> 02:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that the idea of
 
02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
putting the
 
02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
information on driver's license is just
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know i could declare myself
 
02:56:51.590 --> 02:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
anything i wanted yes i put it on my
 
02:56:58.670 --> 02:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:57:07.190 --> 02:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative marshall
 
02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair um i just had to
 
02:57:13.359 --> 02:57:13.830 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair um i just had to
speak

02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
when i heard that america is supposed to
 
02:57:17.429 --> 02:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
be colorblind yes
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
when we live up to our best principles
 
02:57:20.710 --> 02:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
but i think right now we are
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
trying to establish whether or not there
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
is a problem and because this is a
 
02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary program
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
the uh it will give us hard information
 
02:57:32.469 --> 02:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
a study committee is a delaying tactic
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
and will mean nothing without getting
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
hard data
 
02:57:38.469 --> 02:57:38.479 align:start position:0%
to support the uh
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not we are truly
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
colorblind i would love to believe that
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
but i think that we owe something to our
 
02:57:46.309 --> 02:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
citizens to really establish the facts
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the matter
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
the anyone else wish to cut yes
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
i could just respond to the
 
02:57:58.630 --> 02:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative wilbur's comments
 
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
on um collecting the race uh
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
data you know that part of the program
 
02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:05.269 align:start position:0%
data you know that part of the program
is

02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
entirely voluntary when folks go to
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
renew their driver's license
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
they would have the option of including
 
02:58:15.190 --> 02:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
the race and ethnicity
 
02:58:18.150 --> 02:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
data on the license so it's not an
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
enforced um
 
02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know ruled by the state
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
so you know it's totally optional thank
 
02:58:25.439 --> 02:58:29.349 align:start position:0%
so you know it's totally optional thank
you

02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative alexander thank you mr
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you representative
 
02:58:36.230 --> 02:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
dealer and so far introducing this
 
02:58:36.240 --> 02:58:36.950 align:start position:0%
dealer and so far introducing this
amendment

02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
um i just think it's important to point
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
out that the league commission although
 
02:58:41.429 --> 02:58:41.439 align:start position:0%
great commission
 
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
um did a lot of good work there were no
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
legislators on that commission
 
02:58:47.990 --> 02:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that having a study committee
 
02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea so that we have
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
clear separation of powers
 
02:58:52.630 --> 02:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
so we do have people that are studying
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
this in another branch of government
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
so um i would unfortunately have to vote
 
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
to oppose the amendment
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
change my mind not going to ask the
 
02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
change my mind not going to ask the
question

02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:21.190 --> 02:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative simpson just real quickly
 
02:59:21.670 --> 02:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
say that um the lea commission did not
 
02:59:24.399 --> 02:59:24.790 align:start position:0%
say that um the lea commission did not
have

02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:59:27.750 --> 02:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
legislators but it had very many highly
 
02:59:27.760 --> 02:59:29.269 align:start position:0%
legislators but it had very many highly
respected

02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
respected
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
um experts in the in fields of a broad
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
diverse array of stakeholders
 
02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
who are very informed on these issues
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
and the best way to get to reform and
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
they work towards consensus
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
within their group um which represents
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
the citizens and the um residents of
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
granite state so i just want to say that
 
02:59:54.469 --> 02:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
i um
 
02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
i trust them on this and i would like to
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
support this amendment so that we can
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
get the
 
03:00:01.510 --> 03:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
language back in there that will move us
 
03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:02.469 align:start position:0%
language back in there that will move us
closer

03:00:02.469 --> 03:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
closer
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes representative
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
i'd like to respond to representative
 
03:00:18.399 --> 03:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
i'd like to respond to representative
alexander's

03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
alexander's
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion of a study committee you know
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
a study committee is going to be
 
03:00:28.230 --> 03:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
nothing less than a delaying tactic
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
um the recommendations by the
 
03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
leak committee were done in real time
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we need to respond in real time
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can get this program off the
 
03:00:41.910 --> 03:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
ground so
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
i would be very disappointed
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
to see a study committee formed
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
on the race and ethnicity
 
03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:54.720 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment's been defeated
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
open to further amendment representative
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh so i forwarded amendment 1391 to
 
03:03:09.910 --> 03:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
committee last week
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
um essentially amendment 1391 would
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
simply remove section 9 of sb96
 
03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
section 9 addresses the training
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
covering implicit bias and racial
 
03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:20.230 align:start position:0%
covering implicit bias and racial
profiling

03:03:20.230 --> 03:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
profiling
 
03:03:21.990 --> 03:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
the language in section 9 states that
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
quote the chief justice of the supreme
 
03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:24.309 align:start position:0%

superior court and administrative judge
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the circuit board shall encourage all

judges to take
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
training every year um upon doing
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
research according to the code
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
the us code of conduct for judges a
 
03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
judge should respect and comply with the
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
law it should act at all times in a
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
manner that promotes public confidence
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the integrity of impartiality of the
 
03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
in the integrity of impartiality of the
judiciary

03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
judiciary
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
a judge should not allow family social
 
03:03:48.319 --> 03:03:49.349 align:start position:0%
a judge should not allow family social
political

03:03:49.349 --> 03:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
political
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
financial or other relationships to
 
03:03:53.830 --> 03:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
influence judicial conduct or judgment
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
so in order to be a judge basically you
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
have to be advised
 
03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
this language was amended in the senate
 
03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
upon looking back
 
03:04:03.269 --> 03:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
from the mandatory two-hour training
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
every year to the language encouraging
 
03:04:05.359 --> 03:04:06.230 align:start position:0%
every year to the language encouraging
training

03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
so i just get concerned anytime the
 
03:04:09.750 --> 03:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislative branch gets involved
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
in some of the affairs of the judicial
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
system uh this language basically holds
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
no teeth so
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing an amendment um just so
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't clutter up the rsa to get rid
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
practice in the judiciary committee to
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
statute means
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
proud about and especially as this is
 
03:04:55.030 --> 03:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
in its current form it's just a
 
03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:02.309 --> 03:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
section of code and our books are
 
03:05:02.319 --> 03:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
section of code and our books are
already

03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
rather voluminous i only wish that
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
the court would respect some of the
 
03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that we
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
have before not trying to tell us what
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
to do but
 
03:05:26.790 --> 03:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was unable to hear
 
03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
um it was it was muffled on the zoom i
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was the case for
 
03:05:41.590 --> 03:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
everyone i'm sorry
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
moving the microphone thank you i hate
 
03:05:46.469 --> 03:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
to make you repeat yourself
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh briefly i support this
 
03:05:49.120 --> 03:05:50.150 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh briefly i support this
amendment

03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think that this committee has a pretty
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
pretty strong tradition of uh
 
03:05:58.150 --> 03:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing the separation of powers
 
03:06:02.950 --> 03:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
this statute as it's written in
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
currently is only a recommendation
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
to the court and therefore it's
 
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
nothing more than a house resolution i
 
03:06:17.830 --> 03:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
suppose in terms of whatever
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
probably a joint resolution and
 
03:06:23.349 --> 03:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't belong in our
 
03:06:23.359 --> 03:06:24.469 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't belong in our
statutes

03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
03:06:27.030 --> 03:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll uh i'll leave it there and that
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
those are the highlights
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
there are no other comments and
 
03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
this is on amendment 2021-1391-8
 
03:06:53.429 --> 03:06:53.439 align:start position:0%

representative thank you mr chairman um
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
so i think um the oliac
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
report was uh a good good place to start
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think uh this bill now is missing
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
something that's uh
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be an important piece to it so i
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
