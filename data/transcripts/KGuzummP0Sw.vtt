00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
All right.

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:42.500
We call the subcommittee meeting to order on House Bill 370, FN, and we have a proposed amendment to the bill, which unfortunately had an incorrect effective date, but the text of the bill of the amendment is what we're after.

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.000
And this would replace all after the enacting clause.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:09.500
I've got a couple more copies here if anybody needs it but this provides for an amendment to RSA 266 colon 58A Roman 3A to read and to add in or afterward windshield or on the windows to the left and right of the driver.

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:28.500
This is where persons who require medical for medical reasons after attending on windshield or on the witness the left and right of the driver may apply for special permit pursuant to RSA 266 colon 61A Roman 9.

16
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:44.000
Then part two, RSA 266 colon 61A Roman 9 just adds in the same phrase there after the word windshield or on the windows to left or right of the driver.

17
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So this is for anyone who applies for such permit.

18
00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:04.500
And then such waiver shall be granted in accordance with this section and shall only authorize the use of aftermarket tinted windows with a light transmittance of not less than 35%.

19
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
That's changed 70 percent.

20
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000
So that's the extent of the amendment.

21
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The amendment that amendment is 2023-2383H.

22
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.500
You'll get another amendment because this one had 60 days and we had asked for 90 days for the effective date.

23
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500
So any discussion?

24
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500
Thank you, Mr.

25
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500
Chairman.

26
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500
I'm fine with the body of the amendment.

27
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500
It's exactly what we talked about.

28
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:52.500
it will, I believe, clarify and simplify existing language covering both the windshield and right and left windows of the driver and clarify when a special waiver is needed for medical purposes.

29
00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:24.000
So I think we have all agreed what the body of of what we are trying to get to uh the only thing that we had a concern with the amendment that came from the original subcommittee meeting was the effective date and uh and through the best attempts we thought we had the exact but now it's still going to be changed.

30
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:38.500
I would have no problem approving from the subcommittee level what we have in front of us contingent upon that effective date of 60 days being changed to 90.

31
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.000
And I'll make that motion if you would like.

32
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I agree.

33
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I'll second it.

34
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Okay.

35
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.500
And any other discussion of adopting amendment?

36
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Well, we don't have the amendment number, so because it'll get a new number.

37
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500
I don't know that it will.

38
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.000
Brad, will that get a new number?

39
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It will?

40
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You're right.

41
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:33.500
So it um so yes as soon as it's changed it'll will reflect that new number but um i think as far as the recommendation from the subcommittee goes we're we're good to go with this and uh and the newITTEE AND THEN WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING.

42
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
OKAY.

43
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.500
YEAH.

44
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500
I THINK THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

45
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500
OKAY.

46
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
Sure.

47
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:55.000
The motion would be that all of the body of the language in this amendment under 20232383H will remain the same.

48
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:09.000
The only thing that will change is line 15, which is the effective date, and that will change from this act shall take effect 60 days after passage.

49
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.500
It'll change to 90 days after passage.

50
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500
Good.

51
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.500
Yep.

52
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500
Okay.

53
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.500
Any further discussion?

54
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
Seeing none.

55
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.000
All in favor, say aye.

56
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Aye.

57
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Opposed?

58
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Okay.

59
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.500
And since we did not have a notice on HB 37537, which one was it?

60
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.000
We can't discuss it anyway, so adjourn this meeting.

61
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Thank you.

62
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.500
anyway so adjourn this meeting.

63
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500
Thank you.

64
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.500
Thank you.

65
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500
Thank you.

66
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500
Thank you.

67
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.500
Thank you.

68
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500
Thank you.

69
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.000
All right, good morning, everybody.

70
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:12.000
We're going to open up the subcommittee work session on House Bill 646, Eliminating Vehicle Inspection Mandates for Non-Commercial Vehicles.

71
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:26.000
As I said at the last subcommittee meeting we had, the bill in its current form would have a hard time getting through the committee, if at all.

72
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So we were looking at this bill as a vehicle to make some substantive changes to the program to actually, no other way to say it, to make people hate it less.

73
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Timing has been difficult, plus we just came up with a few other ideas, and just quite honestly, we have a deadline before us.

74
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:08.500
We do have at least two bills, possibly three in the upcoming session, that we can use as the vehicle for the changes we were proposing in this subcommittee.

75
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:27.000
So I'll recommend, we only have two of the three of us, but we can operate, that we ITL this one and just look at one of the future bills that we have to continue our work.

76
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Oh, I'll do it.

77
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Sorry, Mr.

78
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:53.500
Chair, I move ITL move itl thank you sir without any other discussion all right uh so the motion to uh recommend itl to the full committee um yeah the motion is to recommend itl to the full committee all those in favor aye opposed?

79
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500
None.

80
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500
Thank you very much.

81
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.500
Try to be quicker next time.

82
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.500
Thank you.

83
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500
Thank you.

84
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.500
Thank you.

85
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.500
Thank you.

86
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.500
Thank you.

87
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.500
Thank you.

88
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.500
Thank you.

89
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.500
Thank you.

90
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.500
Thank you.

91
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.500
Thank you.

92
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.500
Thank you.

93
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.500
Thank you.

94
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.500
Thank you.

95
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.500
Thank you.

96
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.500
Thank you.

97
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.500
Thank you.

98
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.500
Thank you.

99
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.500
Thank you.

100
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.500
Thank you.

101
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500
Thank you.

102
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
Thank you.

103
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.500
Thank you.

104
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.500
Thank you.

105
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.500
Thank you.

106
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.500
Thank you.

107
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.500
Thank you.

108
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500
Thank you.

109
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.500
Thank you.

110
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.500
Thank you.

111
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500
Thank you.

112
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500
Thank you.

113
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500
Thank you.

114
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.500
Thank you.

115
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.500
Thank you.

116
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.500
Thank you.

117
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.500
Thank you.

118
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.500
Thank you.

119
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.500
Thank you.

120
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.500
Thank you.

121
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.500
Thank you.

122
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500
Thank you.

123
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.500
Thank you.

124
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.500
Thank you.

125
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.500
Hi, everybody.

126
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:35.000
Before we get started, Representative Crawford can't make it to our exec session.

127
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Any volunteers to take out any notes on committee work session going in transportation.

128
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Of all the retained bills that we had, the committee decided to do subcommittees on House Bill 55, 370, 537, and 646.

129
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Those have been completed the recommendations are withstanding or ready for us for our executive session this afternoon but I wanted to look at the rest of them before we go into our exec session this afternoon in case anybody had any more thoughts or as you can see I did build in some downtime today if people had the desire to seek amendments.

130
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So this may not take long, but I just wanted to run through the ones that didn't have a subcommittee.

131
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So that being said, the first one just to review, just to prepare House Bill 375.

132
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.500
I was expecting Representative Sykes.

133
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.500
I believe this is his bill.

134
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500
He is.

135
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.500
Has anybody heard from Representative Sykes?

136
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.500
Not today.

137
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500
No.

138
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.500
Well, all right.

139
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.500
Well, this could be really quick.

140
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:17.000
So House Bill 375, does anybody have any thoughts on it in terms of any work that needs to be done before we go into executive session this afternoon?

141
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.500
That says relative to licensure of non-resident aliens temporarily residing in New Hampshire.

142
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:36.500
and what it seeks to do is a temporary license for 180 days for anybody that has sought asylum but not received a green card yet.

143
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.500
Anybody?

144
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.000
I think I have a question, Mr.

145
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Chairman, and perhaps everyone can refresh my memory.

146
00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:04.500
If I understand correctly, this was the discussion or where we got home was on the what constitutes an application or what stage in the process of application would trigger this opportunity to apply for work authorization.

147
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.500
Is that correct?

148
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.500
Oh, and you're applying for asylum.

149
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.000
Is that I don't know if others have recollections.

150
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.500
Yeah, let me look at it for a moment.

151
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:25.500
And relatedly, my recollection was that work authorization kicks in automatically after a year.

152
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:37.000
So we were talking about sort of the six months to a year period that there was an inability to get work authorization.

153
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Is that others' recollection as well?

154
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Yes, it's coming back to me.

155
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Yes, the work authorization comes after a year.

156
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
This sought to give them a temporary driver's license for 180 days.

157
00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.500
Then the conversation said, well, what are you going to do with the balance of the days from 365?

158
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.500
So, yes, you were remembering correctly.

159
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.000
That's why we did decide to interim study it.

160
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I mean, retain it.

161
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Again, I was expecting the prime sponsor to be here possibly with his own his own suggestions but um i'll i'll lead off by saying i'm not going to support the bill this way or with an amendment because i think the way we're doing it at the department of motor vehicles is sufficient um and again when you look at licenses, they have not gone through the system yet.

162
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.500
They haven't been vetted yet.

163
00:13:49.500 --> 00:14:00.000
So these are people that have simply applied for asylum, but had not received their green card or permanent residency yet.

164
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.500
So I'll lead it off with that.

165
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.000
Anybody other, any other thoughts?

166
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And if Representative Sykes does come in later, I'm a fair man.

167
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.500
We can always revisit it.

168
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.500
But anybody else from the committee on 375?

169
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.500
Representative St.

170
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.500
Clair.

171
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500
Okay.

172
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:44.500
You know, since I talked to you briefly about this the other day, I reached out to some friends I have in Massachusetts that are in law enforcement, both on the state level and local law enforcement, to ask them.

173
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:54.000
As you know, in Massachusetts, they had just passed that bill where undocumented residents can get a driver's license.

174
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And I was surprised that every one of them were in favor of it.

175
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And the reason they gave me, all of them, this is not in a group, was that now they actually have some documentation on them that when they're, whether they're stopped in a car or on the street, they ask them for ID, they give them something that they can immediately track or find out exactly who these people are without any funny business, as one of them put it.

176
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.500
So I'm just throwing that out there.

177
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:49.500
Not that that has anything to do with this particular bill, but it kind of does at the same time.

178
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.000
So that's what I wanted to say.

179
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.500
And with regards to Representative Sykes, he may not be feeling well today.

180
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:07.500
I know he's had some health issues, so that may be what's going on right now.

181
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.500
Fair enough.

182
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.500
But anybody else?

183
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.500
Representative Brombo.

184
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:27.000
Were we able to get any confirmation of once an application is received, what sort of documentation we get back indicating that the application is in process.

185
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.500
Do we, do others have a recollection?

186
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:51.000
We can look, I can look back at the minutes or the meeting from the, if we take a break at some point today too, if we come back to this, but I seem to remember that being a sticking point.

187
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Can you ask that again one more time?

188
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Did we get clarification of, there would be confirmation of application received or application in process for asylum?

189
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I seem to recall the discussion, the sticking point being someone can submit an application for asylum, and then would this trigger their ability to get their license?

190
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:34.500
but we know if there's been any initial review of the application, where the application is in process, or if there's some sort of confirmation of that or time frame we're looking at.

191
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.000
I don't necessarily remember that part of the debate.

192
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.500
Let's look at it after the fact.

193
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:54.500
Again, this is, again, I just wanted to touch over these to see if we had anything that anybody wanted to do as amendments.

194
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.500
We have time.

195
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:04.000
We'll certainly be debating this in its entirety when we get to our executive session.

196
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
We're just trying to get a feel and give an opportunity for any amendments.

197
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Anybody else?

198
00:18:13.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And we do have the director here, too, so some of these questions could possibly get asked after the fact so with nothing else on 375 we'll move right along um similar 570 you and this is also representative sites bill relative to real id compliant new hampshire drivers licenses once again i'm just inviting i mean having holding this work session if anybody has come up with anything that they think will help the bill along or otherwise um anybody representative c i was just uh recalling that the whole idea of the real ID was after the 9-11 attacks, where they wanted something to prove that somebody was a citizen before they had a driver's license.

199
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:28.500
because what the 9-11 attackers did was first went to a state that had easy driver's license provisions, got driver's license, and with a driver's license, you can do just about anything else.

200
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.500
Anybody else?

201
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:45.000
In this particular case, because I have had some conversation with a director, do you mind coming up and explaining how the whole process with Real ID works now?

202
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Not to throw you under the bus, but...

203
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Good morning, members of the committee.

204
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
John Morasco, director of Division of Motor Vehicles.

205
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And I'm joined here today with Jeff Oberdank, administrator of registrations, and administrator three, Jim Bailey.

206
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.500
So some areas that go a little more micro, the three of us can certainly field them.

207
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:32.000
As far as this particular bill, what I can tell you is the Real ID Act does allow for those on a pending asylum status to be eligible through the eyes of the federal government for the REAL ID.

208
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.500
In New Hampshire, we don't do that.

209
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:46.500
I've spoken to representatives from REAL ID that run the program, and we are in full compliance with the REAL ID Act.

210
00:20:46.500 --> 00:21:36.000
And the way it's been explained to me is that there are certain aspects of the act that you can choose to implement certain aspects of the act that you don't have to implement and that's a state decision but you're still in compliance with real ID so New Hampshire is in a good place when I offered testimony on this bill when it was coming through several months ago one of the the issues that we talked about we were still trying to get clarification from the federal government on the full vetting process and how that works.

211
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:58.000
So what was explained to me by John Mills from USCIS was that when somebody fills out an application for asylum here in the United States, and that's vetted by Homeland Security, they identify the individual as that individual, so you have true identity.

212
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And at that point, the term that was used during the conversation was the individual is lawfully present.

213
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:23.500
I asked a little more about what lawfully present means with regards to the rest of the vetting process that they conduct, the federal government conducts, and the issuance of the real ID.

214
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:30.000
And I haven't been able to get anything back on that in writing.

215
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:57.000
The rest of the process that was explained to me over the phone was that there may or may not be an interview that takes place with the applicant, and then there is a more thorough background check that's done as time goes on, which can take in its entirety upwards of a year.

216
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:31.500
So really the decision before the committee here is, do you want to entertain the idea of issuing the real ID on a pending asylee based on an application that we now have true identity through the federal government and their database through the save system, or does the committee want to wait until the person has been fully vetted, either through an interview and a more intense background?

217
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.500
I check what that consists of.

218
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500
I don't know.

219
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:47.000
That might take upwards of a year, and then that person would have completed the process and might then be eligible.

220
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.000
In the eyes of the Real ID Act, would, again, be eligible for the Real ID.

221
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:11.000
In the eyes of New Hampshire, and based on the current policy and the way that we operate and issue Real IDs, even with that, there would have to be more conversation.

222
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Thank you, sir.

223
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Anybody else?

224
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Representative Gorski.

225
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Thank you, Mr.

226
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Chairman, and thank you for taking my question.

227
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:48.000
To get back to the vetting process, the initial vetting process that you, in your conversations with the feds, did they go into any detail on what that initial, I understand what you said in regards to, you know, the next six months or so, they do a much deeper.

228
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
But that initial vetting process, did you have any conversations of what that entails?

229
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.500
Thanks for the question, Representative.

230
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:13.500
I can assure you that I painstakingly tried to maximize my time with the representative from USCIS, and I asked a variety of questions that were micro, that being one of them.

231
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.000
What does lawfully present mean?

232
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.500
How do you get to that terminology?

233
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:29.000
And when somebody fills out the application, what is the level of vetting that goes on to establish that?

234
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:44.500
And what was explained to me was that because of the documentation that's presented, that they're able to confirm that that individual that presented that documentation, that's who that individual is.

235
00:25:44.500 --> 00:26:05.000
And then that can be entered into the database, that they are in the SAVE database, the federal government's pipeline to the DMV, letting us know that they have been vetted at that first level and that that is true identity.

236
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
What that means beyond that, I don't know.

237
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I don't know.

238
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:23.000
As far as looking at anything background-related, it didn't appear to me that that part of the process had anything to do with that.

239
00:26:23.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Assessing, is this person somebody that is going to be able to stay in the country legally or not, it doesn't sound like that initial application and that lawfully present through identity has anything to do with what they do on the back half that was my takeaway thank you anybody else rip some coker thank you mr chairman what what was the time frame for that the the first background i don't know if you said i didn't um sorry i'd have to look at my notes on that i want to say the first background um and again please i'm I'm going from memory here, I want to say it was maybe 60 to 90 days.

240
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.500
It was a shorter period of time.

241
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.000
It might have even been as little as 30.

242
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:40.500
But that first piece for that, authenticating the identity of the individual was much shorter than the rest of the process.

243
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:46.000
I want to say it was 30, 60, or 90 days.

244
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
All right.

245
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Thank you.

246
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Thank you.

247
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Representative Hill.

248
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Thank you.

249
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Thank you, Mr.

250
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Chairman.

251
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Thank you for taking my question.

252
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
I have two.

253
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:13.500
One is, what's the minimum age that starts this, that a person can start through that process?

254
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:19.500
Is a person at age 16 able to get a real ID?

255
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:36.500
And the second part of the question was, at what point during this process of becoming or being identified as a legitimately in country, where is the social security number issued in this process?

256
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.500
Good questions.

257
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:50.500
As far as the real ID for the youth operator, youth operator is eligible for the real ID from that time of first license.

258
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:57.000
So that would be for somebody that's eligible through the real ID Act.

259
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.500
They would have that opportunity as well.

260
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:06.000
And as far as the Social Security number in the process?

261
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.500
Do you want to come up, Cheryl?

262
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.500
Good morning.

263
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.500
Jennifer Bailey with DMV.

264
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:23.500
So with Social Security card, after they get their actual documents that would be there for asylates, it's an I-94.

265
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:29.500
That's when they'd be able to apply for a Social Security card.

266
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:34.000
If they're not eligible, they get a denial letter.

267
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Typically, we see Social Security cards are issued to those here on work visas.

268
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:52.500
If you're here on a student visa or you're not work-employed certified as an asylee, you would not get a Social Security number.

269
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.500
Anybody else?

270
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500
Representative Jones.

271
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.500
Thank you, Mr.

272
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.500
Chairman.

273
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:13.000
If I may ask the director, are you saying that this bill is too vague or maybe not use the word vague, not specific enough?

274
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.500
Is that what I'm hearing?

275
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.500
That's a good question.

276
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.500
I don't know that it's not specific enough.

277
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:51.000
I guess what I would say is based on the current New Hampshire's current policy of when to issue the real ID, I think what the bill is intending, you know, for criteria to allow somebody to be eligible for it exceeds the scope of currently what the policy decision is to extract that from the real ID Act.

278
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Thank you, sir.

279
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Thank you.

280
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Anybody else?

281
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
All right.

282
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Let me just I just want to clarify this, too.

283
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.500
The beauty of this exercise is it should make the executive session go much quicker.

284
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:28.500
But if the—so let me—if I have this right, the Real ID Act allows people, would say, an I-94 who have lawful status to be in the country to apply for a Real ID.

285
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.500
in New Hampshire.

286
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:36.500
Currently, we are not giving people merely with an I-94 a license.

287
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:47.500
We are making them go through the process or waiting for them to go through the process to get their permanent residency.

288
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.500
Is that how I...

289
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:57.500
No, so they don't get the I-94 stamped until they've gone through the complete vetted process.

290
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:10.500
So when they come into the country as an asylee, they apply for that asylum status and they get a receipt notice, an I-797 receipt notice.

291
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:18.000
That's what we don't allow you to obtain an original license on in New Hampshire.

292
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
You have to have a valid status, which is that I-94 card.

293
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.500
They don't receive that until they've completed the complete vetted process through UCIC.

294
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:37.000
Okay, so even with an I-94, they still don't have permanent residency though.

295
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:47.500
Correct, but we do allow those who are completed asylees, refugees, and permanent residents are allowed to get real IDs currently.

296
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:54.500
The only ones that we don't allow are pending statuses or those on visas.

297
00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:01.000
They're not there who we don't allow to get real IDs right now.

298
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Okay.

299
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Let me think about this for a moment.

300
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Anybody else?

301
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I'm going to think on this.

302
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Fortunately, our executive session is at 1 o'clock this afternoon.

303
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.500
If nobody else has anything or suggested changes, we'll move on to the next one.

304
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:32.500
I think that the next two were probably the reason, the main reason I called this.

305
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.000
Thank you both very much.

306
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
A little chat in a moment.

307
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:48.500
Let's move on to House Bill 650, relative to prohibiting suspension of driver's licenses due to nonpayment of fines or fees.

308
00:33:48.500 --> 00:34:02.000
And if ever, to refresh everybody's memory, we held on to this only because we have a Senate bill, Senate Bill 13, which we retained as well.

309
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:12.500
I don't want to say the word contradictory, but you're going to decide on one before you decide on the other.

310
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.000
So I'll open it up.

311
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.500
Any thoughts on where 650 should go?

312
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:26.500
And is there anything done or anything, any changes that anybody may have come up with?

313
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.500
Go ahead.

314
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.500
Thank you, Mr.

315
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500
Chairman.

316
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:44.000
I did a little bit of work on this over the summer, not nearly enough to say that it's ready to be passed.

317
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:55.500
but one of the major sticking points is that driving under suspension is a misdemeanor in New Hampshire as opposed to a violation.

318
00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:16.000
So I did speak with Representative Lynn, who is a former state judge, and we share the concern that, you know, because you didn't pay a fine of a couple hundred dollars, that you may be then charged with a misdemeanor.

319
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:26.500
So it kind of creates a kind of a stacked charge on top of what should be really a minor violation.

320
00:35:26.500 --> 00:36:23.000
So having a misdemeanor on top of what may be a non-moving violation or non-vehicle related violation is maybe not the best way to go and it's the kind of situation we would be running into with sb 13 where you may be responsible for a couple hundred dollars in fees for a rescue on a mountain somewhere and you know maybe i don't know what situation would lead to you not paying it and having your license suspended and driving anyway, but it would really be unfortunate to have somebody charged with a misdemeanor, which will stay on their record for what should be really a minor violation, if anything at all.

321
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
So, um, I'm not really prepared to support the bill, um, without some changes.

322
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Cause I think the driving under suspension for any reason is kind of a complex issue.

323
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And I don't think this bill addresses all the concerns, but I think we should take a deeper look at it and maybe look at SB 13 through that window.

324
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Thank you.

325
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Interesting.

326
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Anybody else?

327
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Rep.

328
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Smith.

329
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Thank you, Mr.

330
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Chair.

331
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
So I don't know.

332
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000
I start at the point where we're a fee for service state.

333
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.500
I paid for my license and unless I abuse it, I don't think I should lose it.

334
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:31.000
We just have the spider web of various reasons you can take a driver's license.

335
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:40.000
So for example, we've got one, two, like the third paragraph, including orders made pursuant to RSA 161B11.

336
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
I was curious what that was.

337
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.500
And conveniently looked up the wrong statute.

338
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.500
Hold up.

339
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.500
That was fireworks.

340
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.500
Here we go.

341
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.500
So child support.

342
00:37:54.500 --> 00:38:00.000
You don't pay child support, you can lose your driver's license.

343
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:21.000
A case that I have personal knowledge of, a gentleman went to court in Sullivan County Superior Court because he had lost his job, not informed the Office of Child Support Collection immediately, like he should have, and ended up in arrearage.

344
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:35.000
He got a new job, began working that job, was going to pay it off, and in the middle of this time, he was called to a hearing.

345
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:54.500
He went into a conference room before the hearing in the Superior Court, worked out a payment arrangement, then went into the courtroom, but the judge wasn't having it, and said, well, do you have $800 on you today?

346
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.000
He said, well, no, sir, I don't.

347
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Remand.

348
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.500
They took him to the county jail right then and there.

349
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.500
So what happens next?

350
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:19.000
Well, he didn't want to lose his job because the whole point is to get the child support money to the kids, right?

351
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:30.000
So his wife, ex-wife, had to find the $800 and pay it for him so that he could get to his job.

352
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
You suspend his license on top of that, then what?

353
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.500
She's going to drive him to work every day?

354
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.000
That's not good for anybody.

355
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.500
So I just, I don't like this entanglement that goes on.

356
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.500
Locking him up, okay, fine, figure that out.

357
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:57.500
If somebody owes me a civil penalty and they don't pay, fine.

358
00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500
Attach their paycheck.

359
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.000
I mean, there are other methods available.

360
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.500
I don't think it should have anything to do with licenses.

361
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500
Any other thoughts?

362
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:21.000
Well, the one thing I'm going to look into, not that I, because I don't necessarily agree, whoop, Representative Jones, sorry.

363
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Thank you, Mr.

364
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Chairman.

365
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:43.000
If I remember back when we were discussing this, there was just a common sense approach that if you owe money and they take away your license, you can't go to work to pay that money.

366
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
So it was kind of a common sense approach that I remember.

367
00:40:49.000 --> 00:41:01.000
And I don't remember if it was a representative or someone from the public that said it, but it just made sense to me.

368
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Well, if I remember right, I don't believe you can make much money if you're locked up either.

369
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:23.500
So I'm going to check my notes through any other room on who testified, because I still have the impression this has done as a last resort.

370
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:30.500
And if I believe, if I remember the testimony correct, we'll look into it.

371
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.500
Anybody else?

372
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.500
Representative Sellers.

373
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.500
Thank you, Mr.

374
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.500
Chair.

375
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:51.000
So I'm just trying to organize this in my mind that what we're trying to do is, or what we're thinking of, is being consistent.

376
00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:07.000
We're either going to fine them for everything, and they could lose their license for everything, every type of infraction, or we really want to take that away so they're all consistent.

377
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:17.500
And right now, it sounds like the license itself should not be connected to any other infractions that are out there.

378
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.500
That's what I'm hearing.

379
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.500
From some, yes.

380
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:38.500
Others may still believe that it is a privilege, and it's one of the few things that they have to get the fines and fees paid, and it is used as a last resort.

381
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.500
So, yeah, that's where we're at.

382
00:42:41.500 --> 00:43:25.500
but but but again too uh i just opened this up to see if anybody had done any work and wanted to make any changes that might make it more palatable for everybody uh i am going to check on a couple things in our break before the executive session unless steve or i mean representative smith already has i if i agreed with you with the fact that locking them up would be better than pulling their license, if this were to pass, does that happen automatically?

383
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:33.000
And that's what I want to look into in our downtime, unless you already have.

384
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
No, he hasn't.

385
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
So, my homework.

386
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Anybody else on 650?

387
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
All right.

388
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Yep, Representative C.

389
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:54.000
My notes show that pretty much everybody who testified, and there were a number of people, all were in support of this.

390
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
All right.

391
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
That being said, let's have a quick discussion on our last one.

392
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
It's still relative, Senate Bill 13.

393
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000
I guess the decision on one will actually make your decision on the other.

394
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:19.000
But just in case there's something different here than I remember, take a look.

395
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Yeah, this is the only change.

396
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:43.000
the director of motor vehicles of such persons's nonpayment and request suspension of the driver's license, the changes or driving privileges, or deny the issuance or renewal of a person's driver's license 21 days after providing the notice required by paragraph 4.

397
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:52.500
for, as the bill title says, for failure to pay search and recovery or search and rescue recovery expenses.

398
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.000
I don't know how much we need to talk about that.

399
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:08.500
I believe 650, your decision on that, is going to determine where you are on this, but I'll open it up.

400
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.500
Representative C.

401
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:24.000
One of the points of testimony on the SB 13 was that if you have the hike safe card, that that'll take care of all the expenses.

402
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.500
So you wouldn't have to worry about losing your license anyway.

403
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.500
That is correct.

404
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.500
Anybody else to offer on Senate Bill 13?

405
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.500
Representative Gorski.

406
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.500
Thank you, Mr.

407
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.500
Chairman.

408
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:51.000
You know, in my notes here, when I remember the testimony, they brought up there were only seven examples.

409
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.500
So we're not talking here like there's, you know, 50, 60, 70 instances.

410
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.500
We're talking seven examples.

411
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:05.500
And in terms of the dollar figures, they weren't that very high.

412
00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:13.500
So it just looks like this is just, as Representative C, it's off the hike safeguard.

413
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:24.000
Seven to me is not like a huge egregious number to go off and do something regarding taking away someone's license.

414
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Anybody else?

415
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.500
I see Colonel Jordan here.

416
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:35.500
Did you want to offer anything on this for the work session or not?

417
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.000
Well, it's a work session, so absolutely.

418
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.500
My name is Colonel Kevin Jordan, New Hampshire Fish and Game.

419
00:46:44.500 --> 00:47:07.000
The reason this bill came was because the House of Representatives a number of years ago during one of our multiple attempts to fund or better fund search and rescue came up with this law to allow us to bill reckless hikers or negligent hikers.

420
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:21.000
And in that bill, in that law, 206-26-BB, they had put in the clause that their licenses would be suspended if we were unable to collect this money.

421
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:30.000
But they never gave us, we never got the proper companion statute in motor vehicle to do that.

422
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.500
So we didn't feel comfortable doing that.

423
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:47.000
And the director of motor vehicles at the time prior to our current director felt that the law didn't have enough teeth, so we couldn't do that.

424
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So you're right, sir.

425
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
We don't use it a lot.

426
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000
I bill probably – we do 200 missions or more each year.

427
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.500
We bill probably 12 people total on an average.

428
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:17.500
The one thing that this law does help me with, it is a last resort after multiple letters and multiple attempts to collect, and we're unable to collect this money.

429
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:26.500
The only way that I ever get the payment is when we threaten to suspend a driver's license.

430
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.500
That's when people will pay it.

431
00:48:29.500 --> 00:49:13.000
HikeSafe protects the negligence part of it, or a fishing license, or a hunting license, or a registration for an OHRV or a boat any of those things would trump this unless they're extremely negligent where people's lives are put at risk to go get them so but I can tell you that there will be a number of these folks that won't pay and I will be I won't have the authority or the power to collect that without some sort of a consequence for that.

432
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
So it started in the legislature.

433
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
That's why we came back here.

434
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:35.000
I'll certainly respect any decision that you make, but it was due to the inability to have enough teeth to get a consequence when the bill was put in back in 2015.

435
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
That's why we brought it back.

436
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Thank you.

437
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:52.000
So according to statute, there's nothing, well, do you know of anything that would actually require them to be jailed if they didn't pay?

438
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Or is this the most far as you can go?

439
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.500
This would be as far as I could go.

440
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:07.500
And I wouldn't want to jail someone because they can't pay it.

441
00:50:07.500 --> 00:51:15.500
You it's uh some of these people are you know we quite frankly we negotiate this because some of these rescues can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars if it goes on for four three or four days and we use helicopter services so a lot of times i've reached out to these folks as long as we can start a communication i've the attorney general's office has given me the authority to negotiate that down you know we've whittled that down to half or less than half um to try and help folks i only look to suspend licenses when i cannot reach these people at all and they completely avoid all calls all letters and have no intentions of paying and if we don't have some consequence there they won won't pay.

442
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.500
And we won't recoup that money.

443
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:24.000
So that's, I think, essentially why the legislature did it originally.

444
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.500
But they didn't put in the companion statute of motor vehicle to allow for it.

445
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:38.000
So, yeah, there's nothing there that I could do if we get there.

446
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:55.500
And I have a few of those folks in a stack now waiting because I stopped asking for the suspension until we got this matter cleared up that we haven't been able to collect on.

447
00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:04.500
So it is a last ditch for folks that we can't or have refused any and all contact.

448
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.500
Thank you, sir.

449
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.500
Anybody from the committee?

450
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.500
I see two.

451
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.500
Representative Fox.

452
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.500
Thank you, Mr.

453
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.500
Chair.

454
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:48.500
thank you carl um you said that the threat of taking the driver's license usually gets a response i don't i can't think i cannot think of one time that we suspended a license i can think of a number of times we sent the final letter saying that if you fail to pay by this date, your license or privileges will be suspended.

455
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:52.000
I don't remember one time doing it.

456
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
How many of those threats for license suspensions has resulted in payment?

457
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:17.500
I don't know the exact number, but I can tell you that when we bill seven to 12 a year out of that, it's less than five usually that we don't, that will not contact us under any circumstances.

458
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.500
Thank you.

459
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.500
Thank you.

460
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.500
Representative Jones.

461
00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.500
Thank you, Mr.

462
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.500
Chairman.

463
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.500
And thank you, Colonel.

464
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.500
Yes, sir.

465
00:53:31.500 --> 00:54:04.500
thank you mr chairman and thank you colonel yes sir do you use the term violator and is a violator someone who doesn't have the hike safe or any of those other licenses that you mentioned or is a violator something else no so they're uh they're actually we what we do in a mission after after a mission, we review why that call originally came.

466
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:16.000
And so we look at a whole host of things, the type of equipment they had, the weather conditions, all of those things.

467
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:23.500
And we make a determination based on all of that evidence of negligence or recklessness.

468
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:45.000
if in fact they have a hike safe card or they have a hunting license or fishing license where they've contributed to the search and rescue fund by the purchase of those things to some degree, then we don't bill them for that.

469
00:54:45.000 --> 00:55:04.000
If they have not done any of this, if they have not contributed in any way and their actions, this whole rescue could have been avoided or their actions were negligent or reckless, then we would bill them.

470
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:29.500
Then we would find – I make the determination based on my field staff that this is a negligent hiker, and then I submit it to the Attorney General's office where it's reviewed again, and then they make the determination, yes, we're going to send a bill or no, we're not.

471
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.500
That's how it works.

472
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.500
Thank you.

473
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.500
Yes, sir.

474
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.500
That's clear.

475
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.500
Representative Sellers.

476
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.500
Thank you, Mr.

477
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.500
Jerry.

478
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:53.500
Sir, I was just wondering, how do you handle out-of-state or someone from California or Oregon or something like that?

479
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:57.500
And those actually, it's a good question, sir.

480
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.500
Thank you.

481
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:14.000
Those are actually the ones that I have the most trouble with because I think they feel safe being out of state, but it would suspend their privileges here.

482
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:34.500
And believe it or not, that triggers a payment in most cases because these people usually, not always, these people are usually have family here or they plan a return trip and they just don't want to have their licenses suspended.

483
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:41.500
So, um, the out of state people are the ones that I struggle with.

484
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:49.500
And, you know, I can't stress to you enough, I look very, I raised three kids.

485
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:56.000
I know what it's like to have a family and a tight budget.

486
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:05.500
And I look at the cost of some of these rescues and we are very liberal on my negotiations.

487
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.500
I'm pretty easy.

488
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:21.500
You know, I want them to pay something if they've contributed nothing, because I don't think it's fair to the sportsmen and women who are paying the bill.

489
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:30.000
But I don't necessarily hold out to have them pay eighty two thousand dollars for a helicopter.

490
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000
I'm looking to have them pay the officer's time for doing that.

491
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.500
And I think that's fair.

492
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:45.000
I think the legislature, frankly, that was a fair resolve to that issue.

493
00:57:45.000 --> 00:58:33.500
The problem is I don't have the authority based on the way the current law is written to to carry it out so it's a it's it's a threat i don't make because i can't i can't bring it like there's no consequence for it currently anybody else seeing no one thank you sir thank you um any other thoughts on this one interesting representative smith thank you mr chair if perhaps the director would indulge us i have a question probably best directed to him would you care to indulge us director thank you Thank you.

494
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.500
Thank you.

495
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:42.000
So in reading the bill, it references your authority to suspend in 263.56.

496
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And am I correct that according to 263.56, the most you can do is a one-year revocation of suspension in this case?

497
00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:03.500
If I could, sir, is Jen Bailey is the former supervisor of financial responsibility, so she's very familiar with that statute.

498
00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.500
Good morning again.

499
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:41.500
So under authority of suspensions, we're able to suspend until the fine is paid so we used to suspend prior to my time suspend for search and rescue um it was the previous director that eliminated that ability so we used to suspend and we suspend you until we receive notification from fish and game that they are receiving payments or that they are no longer interested in that fine being paid.

500
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.500
Okay, follow up, Mr.

501
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.500
Chair.

502
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.500
Follow up.

503
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.500
So 263, Roman numeral 3 is pretty specific.

504
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:58.500
So where does the authority to suspend indefinitely come from, if not the statute?

505
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
I'm sorry.

506
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.000
I don't have that law in front of me.

507
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Do you have this?

508
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Two 50.

509
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
56.

510
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I don't know.

511
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Well, maybe afterwards, because this defines.

512
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:35.500
So the main title of Section three in this statute is that the directors shall not revoke or suspend the driver's license under the provisions of this section, the section which gives you the authority to suspend or revoke.

513
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:57.000
and for a period in excess of one year, except in the case of a person whose license is suspended or revoked pursuant to RSA 26356-1G, which is reckless or unlawful operation, materially contributed to an accident resulting in death injury, goes on.

514
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Or, in the case of a person whose license is suspended or revoked under 26356 ID, which is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle to a reason of physical or mental impairment.

515
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:27.500
In that case, you may revoke or suspend indefinitely, provided that the person may request a hearing once every year thereafter for the purpose of reviewing the original order.

516
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:41.000
That is the end of the section, so I'm curious as to where you get the authority to do more than a year in any other situation.

517
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:54.500
So what I'm getting at is, unless there's some other statute authorizing you to suspend or revoke, this is the one you will have to adhere to.

518
01:01:54.500 --> 01:02:03.500
And if the person can avoid their $100,000 bill for a year, then they're good to go, right?

519
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.000
I'm just reading through it.

520
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.500
So this section goes into habitual offender.

521
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:15.500
So those time frames of over a year are for habitual offender.

522
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:56.000
So if you go up above where it starts, the section one, two, and three, it goes in with how many points are assessed because we do it does list all of the reckless that we're able to suspend for certain minimum periods of time um but that goes into habitual offender but when we have a requirement from any other jurisdiction like child support for, for example, is another one that we mentioned, we suspend until that compliance is met.

523
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I do see where you're seeing that year, but further up, it is talking about habitual offender information.

524
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:18.500
information i agree with you that section roman numeral 2 refers to habitual offender, but I'm referring to Roman numeral 3, which is its own main section.

525
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:25.000
And specifically talks about cases that have nothing to do with habitual offender.

526
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.500
You want to maybe think about it and get back to us later?

527
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.000
I'm not sure on that.

528
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Thank you.

529
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.500
Yeah, we can all look into it.

530
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.500
That's why I'm having this exercise.

531
01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.500
Anything else on Senate Bill 13?

532
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500
Seeing none.

533
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.500
As I said, welcome, Representative Sykes.

534
01:03:50.500 --> 01:04:00.000
And I just pulled this full committee work session together on the bills that we didn't have subcommittees for.

535
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:18.500
I did say I would give you an opportunity if you had been working on anything or any amendments or had any thoughts on any of the bills that we retained but did not have subcommittees on.

536
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.000
Hold on just a second.

537
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
No problem.

538
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:36.000
The reason I did this is because we didn't have subcommittees on them, if we came up with ideas, there is time to go to OLS.

539
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So yeah, we can debate this at the executive session.

540
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
But thank you.

541
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Sorry, I'm late.

542
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Not a problem.

543
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I apologize for everybody.

544
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So you're good on everything else in terms of discussion and amendments?

545
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Okay.

546
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:10.500
Well, again, I built in plenty of extra time for some discussions and opportunities to make it to OLS if we see something that we need fixed.

547
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.500
That was the reason for this.

548
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:27.500
Seeing nothing from anybody else, I'll close this work session, and we won't be back here till 1 o'clock to exec all of them before we leave today.

549
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.500
Thank you.

550
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.500
Thank you.

551
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500
Thank you.

552

Good afternoon, everybody.

Welcome to Transportation for our executive session on retained bills.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:11:02.000

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Welcome, Representative Weber.

713
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000

714
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.500
And we have Representative Long.

715
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.500

718
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.500
Oh, Representative Platt.

719
01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.500

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.500

723
01:11:30.500 --> 01:12:50.500

724
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:56.500
And so I could support an interim study motion for that reason.

725
01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.500
Anybody else?

726
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:02.000
Seeing none, the motion is interim study.

727
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.500
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll when she's ready.

728

762
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500
Representative Long?

763
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.500
Yes.

764
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.500
Chairman Walsh?

765
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.500
Yes.

766
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
18 to 0.

767
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:30.500
All right, so our recommendation of interim studies adopted 18-0.

768
01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.500
Closes the executive session on House Bill 55.

769
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:40.000
A minute to reset, and we'll go into House Bill 370.

770
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Sorry.

771

Consent, that is.

774
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Thank you, sir.

775
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I'm a little rusty.

776
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.500
It's been a few months.

777
01:14:54.500 --> 01:15:01.000
Okay, we're going to open up the executive session on House Bill 370.

778
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Relative to aftermarket window tinting on motor vehicles for drivers with medical conditions, Chair recognizes Representative C with a motion.

779
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.500
For House Bill 370, I move that we make it ought to pass.

780
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500
Okay.

781
01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.500
Motion's ought to pass.

782
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
Is there a second?

783
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
Second.

784
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500
Seconded by Representative Hill.

785
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.500
This is open to further amendment.

786
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.500
Chair recognizes Representative C.

787
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.500
All right.

788
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500
I move.

789
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.500
We adopt Amendment 2023-2395H.

790
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.500
Is there a second?

791
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.500
Second by Representative Hill.

792
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.500
Would you care to speak to your motion?

793
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Can you read that number again?

794
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:56.500
Because I have a different number on the copy that was given to me.

795
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.000
What was that number again?

796
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Representative C?

797
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Two, three, nine, five, H is the last four digits.

798
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.500
Which one do you have, Representative Sykes?

799
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.500
We had some confusion with the effective date.

800
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.000
I've got a different one.

801
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.500
The one we're looking for, which is what he's got, say, 90 days after passing.

802
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500
Wait a minute.

803
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500
Thank you.

804
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.000
Can I have a moment?

805
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Oh, here Sykes.

806
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.500
Representative Seed, would you care to speak to your motion on the amendment?

807
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.500
Okay.

808
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:54.000
This amendment is a replace-all, but it clarifies in RSA 266, colon 58A, Roman 3A, for persons who require medical reasons after market tinting on the windshield.

809
01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:02.500
It adds after the windshield or on the windows to the left and right of the driver.

810
01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:12.500
Part 2 amends RSA 266 colon 61A, which is the paragraph that allows the commissioner to waive requirements of 266.58A.

811
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:22.000
And after the word windshield, it adds or on the windows to the left or right of the driver.

812
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And then the next sentence, it allows the waiver to be granted to authorize the use of active market tinted windshields with light transmission of not less than 35% instead of the existing 70% that's in the bill.

813
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.500
And the effective date is 90 days after passage.

814
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.500
Thank you, sir.

815
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.000
Anybody else from the committee?

816
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.500
I'll just add a couple of things.

817
01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.500
Thank you for the subcommittee for doing this.

818
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:05.500
For anybody that remembers, this was the changes that put us in this situation were unintended.

819
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:17.000
This all occurred when we legalized aftermarket window tinting for everybody on their side windows at 70%, and this just got caught up.

820
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:30.500
The outcry was great, so we are basically just returning it to the way it was prior to making it legal for everybody to have the 70.

821
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:34.500
We didn't seem to have any issues then.

822
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:42.000
Hopefully we will not now that this is going back to the way it was.

823
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:50.500
In terms of the effective date, I did go over that with the Department of Motor Vehicles.

824
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:59.000
They say that's more than enough time, seeing as though the rules already existed at one time.

825
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So anybody else from the committee?

826
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Seeing none.

827
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I guess I can just do a voice vote on the amendment.

828
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.500
All those in favor of Amendment 2395H say aye.

829
01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.500
Aye.

830
01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.500
Opposed, nay.

831
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.500
Okay.

832
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.000
So the amendment is adopted.

833
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.500
The motion on the floor is ought to pass as amended.

834
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.000
Anybody else wish to speak to it?

835
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Representative Jones.

836
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Thank you, Mr.

837
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Chairman.

838
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I came into this meeting ready to ITL this, but I think the amendment is a great compromise, so I will be supporting it.

839
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Thank you, sir.

840
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Anybody else?

841
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Seeing none, the motion is out to pass as amended.

842
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.500
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll when she's ready.

843
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.500
Vice Chairman Gorski?

844
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.500
Yes.

845
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.500
Representative Smith?

846
01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.500
Yes.

847
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.500
Clerk votes yes.

848
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Representative Hill?

849
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.500
Yes.

850
01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.500
Representative Platt?

851
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.500
Yes.

852
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.500
Representative Foote?

853
01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.500
Oh, she's not here.

854
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.500
Representative C?

855
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.500
Yes.

856
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.500
Representative Sellers?

857
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.500
Yes.

858
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.500
Representative Sykes?

859
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.500
Yes.

860
01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.500
Representative Rich?

861
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.500
Yes.

862
01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.500
Representative Sinclair?

863
01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.500
Yes.

864
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.500
Thank you.

865
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.500
Yes.

866
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.500
Representative Long.

867
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.500
Yes.

868
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.500
Chairman Walsh.

869
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.500
Yes.

870
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.500
18 to 0.

871
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:05.500
So our recommendation is ought to pass as amended 18-0.

872
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.000
I did hear a motion for consent.

873
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Any objections?

874
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.500
Seeing none, consent it is.

875
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:18.000
I'll close the executive session on House Bill 370.

876
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.500
We're not going to be going in order completely.

877
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.500
We'll take up 537 in a few minutes.

878
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.500
Thank you, Mr.

879
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.500
Chairman.

880
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:36.000
I would like to move House Bill 537 inexpedient to legislate.

881
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Motions, ITL, is there a second?

882
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Sure.

883
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Second.

884
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Representative Smith, I heard him first.

885
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.500
Would you care to speak to your motion, sir?

886
01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.500
Quickly.

887
01:21:52.500 --> 01:22:09.000
It would seem that with the passage on consent of House Bill 370, It virtually meets or exceeds the request by the sponsor of House Bill 537, so it would make it unnecessary.

888
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.500
Anybody else from the committee?

889
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.500
Seeing none.

890
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.000
Motion is ITL on 537.

891
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.500
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll when she's ready.

892
01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.500
Vice Chairman Gorski?

893
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.500
Yes.

894
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.500

896
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500

Yes.

901
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
Representative Platt?

902
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500
Yes.

903
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.500
Representative C?

904
01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
Sorry.

905
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500
You said yes, right?

906
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500
Thank you.

907
01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500
Representative Sellers?

908
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.500
Yes.

Yes.

Representative Rombo?

918
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.500
Yes.

919
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.500
Representative Ayou?

920
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
Yes.

921
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500
Representative Coker?

922
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
Yes.

923
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.500
Representative Jones?

924
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500
Yes.

925
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500
Representative Weber?

926
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
Yes.

927
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.500
Representative Long?

928
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.500
Yes.

929
01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.500
Chairman Walsh?

930
01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500
Yes.

931
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500
18 Coker.

932
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.500
Yes.

933
01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.500
Representative Jones.

934
01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500
Yes.

935
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500
Representative Weber.

936
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.500
Yes.

937
01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500

Yes.

941
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.000
It's at 18 to 0.

942
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.500
Okay, our recommendation of ITL or an expedient to legislate is adopted 18 to 0.

943
01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.500
Motion for consent.

944
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.500
Any objections?

945
01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.500
Consent, that is.

946
01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.000
I'll close the executive session.

947
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.500
Next up, give us a few minutes.

948
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500
House Bill 646.

949
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
Thank you.

950
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:36.000
Okay, I'm going to open up the executive session on House Bill 646, eliminating the vehicle inspection mandate for non-commercial vehicles.

951
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.500
Chair recognizes Representative C for a motion.

952
01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500
Thank you, Mr.

953
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.500
Chairman.

954
01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:48.000
On House Bill 646, the motion is interim study.

955
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Motion to interim study.

956
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Is there a second?

957
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Second.

958
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Seconded by Representative Gorski.

959
01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Would you care to speak to your study, is there a second?

960
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Second.

961
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Seconded by Representative Gorski.

962
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.500
Would you care to speak to your motion, sir?

963
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:34.500
Yeah, this one, because there are some complications on what was asked for, and there are some other bills apparently coming up for next year, that um this was uh the motion was interim study so as not to have an ITL that might interfere with those bills.

964
01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.500
Yep, thank you, sir.

965
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:49.500
And this was one of the ones that we did hold on to to use as a vehicle for making some changes to the inspection program.

966
01:25:49.500 --> 01:26:00.500
We are up against the deadline plus a a couple of new ideas that we haven't even started to get into yet.

967
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.500
So I concur with Representative C.

968
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:11.000
We're just doing the interim study versus an ITL to be on the safe side.

969
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.500
Anybody else from the committee?

970
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500
Representative Sykes.

971
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:20.500
So my original inclination was to vote against an OTP.

972
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:28.500
In fact, I'd be looking to do an ITL for eliminating vehicle inspections for two years.

973
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:55.000
I have been cautiously persuaded by the chairman that there's a couple of things that maybe are worth fixing, and this will make it possible for those particular ideas to see the light of day, which I think is incumbent upon the legislature to always make sure that ideas get a fair hearing.

974
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.500
And frankly, for that reason only, I would be in support of an interim motion.

975
01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.500
Thank you sir.

976
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.000
Anybody else from the committee?

977
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Seeing none.

978
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.500
Motion on 646 House Bill 646 is interim study.

979
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:19.000
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll when she's ready.

980
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Vice Chairman Gorski?

981
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yes.

982
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Representative Smith?

983
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Yes.

984
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Clerk votes yes.

985
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Representative Hill?

986
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Yes.

987
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Representative Platt?

988
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Yes.

989
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Representative C?

990
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Yes.

991
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Representative Sellers?

992
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Yes.

993
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Representative Sykes?

994
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Yes.

995
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Representative Rich?

996
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yes.

997

Representative Sinclair?

998
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Yes.

999
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Representative Fox?

1000
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Yes.

1001
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Representative Rambo?

1002
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Yes.

1003
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Representative Veyu?

1004
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Yes.

1005
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Representative Coker?

1006
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yes.

1007
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Representative Jones?

1008
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Yes.

1009
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Representative Weber?

1010
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Yes.

1011
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Representative Long?

1012
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Yes.

1013
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And Chairman Walsh?

1014
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Yes.

1015
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Okay, 18 to 0.

1016
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.500
So our recommendation on House Bill 646, interim studies adopted, 18 to 0.

1017
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.500
We can.

1018
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.500
I've heard a motion for consent.

1019
01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500
Any objections?

1020
01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Seeing none, I'll close.

1021
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
Consent it is.

1022
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:53.000
I'll close the executive session on House Bill 646.

1023
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.500
Next up, I'm not sure.

1024
01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.500
Hold on one minute.

1025
01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500
13.

1026
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500
I don't know.

1027
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500
Don't look at me.

1028
01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.500
13.

1029
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.500
Senate 13, Senate bill 13 next.

1030
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:17.500
I'll open up the executive session on Senate Bill 13 relative to recovery of search and rescue expenses.

1031
01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:21.000
Chair recognizes Representative Gorski with a motion.

1032
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Thank you, Mr.

1033
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Chair.

1034
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I move to ITL SB 13.

1035
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Thank you.

1036
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:37.500
You know, when I first heard this, I was kind of torn on this bill.

1037
01:29:37.500 --> 01:30:06.000
because between people who are not being wise in terms of going off and going off on trails, when I started to hear the testimony in regards to using, getting, having the ability to go after people's licenses if they don't pay, if they had to go search and rescue people, we start looking at the numbers.

1038
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:16.000
There isn't a lot of numbers in regards to how many times they've gone out and had to bill people.

1039
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Even today's testimony in the morning, you know, he mentioned that, you know, when they sent out the letter regarding, you know, if you don't pay, we're going to do something regarding your license.

1040
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.500
He even mentioned that out of eight, five totally disregarded him.

1041
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:48.500
As a result, I don't see this as a vehicle, and that's why I think we should ITL this bill.

1042
01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:50.500
Thank you.

1043
01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.000
Anybody else from the committee?

1044
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Representative Sykes.

1045
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
So I'm in support of the ITL motion.

1046
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I had a nice conversation with the colonel.

1047
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:18.500
I explained to him that from my perspective, some of the legislative goals that some of us have had has been to trying to disassociate loss of license for non-driver-related offenses.

1048
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:22.500
And this bill is antithetical to that notion.

1049
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:35.000
and for that reason even though though I was a co-sponsor, as I said to him, mature reflection advises me to vote for the ITL.

1050
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Thank you.

1051
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.500
Anybody else from the committee?

1052
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.500
Representative Smith.

1053
01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.500
Thank you, Mr.

1054
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.500
Chair.

1055
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:59.000
Since the whole point is to recover the expenses, I would like them to be able to drive to work so that they can pay those expenses.

1056
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Anybody else?

1057
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Seeing none, motion on the floor is ITL on Senate Bill 13.

1058
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.500
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll when she's ready.

1059
01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.500
Vice Chairman Gorski?

1060
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.500
Yes.

1061
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.500
Representative Smith?

1062
01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.500
Yes.

1063
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.500
Clerk votes yes.

1064
01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.500
Representative Hill?

1065
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.500
Yes.

1066
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.500
Representative Black?

1067
01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.500
Yes.

1068
01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.500
Representative C?

1069
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.500
Yes.

1070
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.500
Representative Sellers?

1071
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.500
Yes.

1072
01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:40.500
Representative Sykes?

1073
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.500
Yes.

1074
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.500
Representative Rich?

1075
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.500
Yes.

1076
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.500
Representative St.

1077
01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.500
Clair?

1078
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.500
No.

1079
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.500
Representative Fox?

1080
01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.500
Yes.

1081
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.500
Representative Sykes?

1082
01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.500
Yes.

1083
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.500
Representative Rich?

1084
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.500
Yes.

1085
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.500
Representative St.

1086
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:08.500
Clair?

1087
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.500
No.

1088
01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.500
Representative Fox?

1089
01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.500
Yes.

1090
01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:16.500
Representative Rombo?

1091
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.500
Yes.

1092
01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.500
Representative Bayou?

1093
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.500
Yes.

1094
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.500
Representative Coker?

1095
01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.500
Yes.

1096
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.500
Representative Jones?

1097
01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.500
Yes.

1098
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.500
Representative Weber?

1099
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.500
Yes.

1100
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:36.500
Representative Long?

1101
01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.500
Yes.

1102
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.500
Chairman Walsh.

1103
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.500
No.

1104
01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.500
16 to 2.

1105
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:50.000
So our committee recommendation of ITL is adopted 16 to 2.

1106
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.500
Is that going on consent?

1107
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:56.000
I don't have a problem with it.

1108
01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I'm not going to speak to it on the floor.

1109
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Two, it's borderline.

1110
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.500
We'll put it on consent if that's...

1111
01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.500
I think you should check with Representative St.

1112
01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:14.500
Clair to see how he feels about that.

1113
01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:19.000
Would you like to fight it on the floor?

1114
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I have no issue with it being addressed.

1115
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Okay.

1116
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
So with no...

1117
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.500
You didn't let me get to it.

1118
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.000
I was going to ask without objection.

1119
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.000
So with no objection, we'll let it stay on consent.

1120
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000
That being said, I'll close the executive session on Senate Bill 13.

1121
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.500
Give me one moment, please.

1122
01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:50.000
OK, here's where we're at.

1123
01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:17.500
This was not part of my plans, and I did hold the work session this morning, the full committee on these other bills that we didn't have subcommittees on, figuring that if we had any minor changes, we could sneak over to OLS and make it an amendment over here before we exacted this afternoon.

1124
01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:27.000
But I think some of the things that I heard personally are not going to get fixed that quick.

1125
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.500
So I'm not going to be taking up $375 today, $570, or $650.

1126
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:37.000
We're going to have to reschedule those.

1127
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.500
If we want to stick till Tuesdays.

1128
01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:44.000
Next week's out because it's municipal elections.

1129
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So I guess we're looking at the 14th.

1130
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000
The deadline to report out is the 17th, so we do have the time.

1131
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
So that's what we're going to do with those three.

1132
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Unfortunately, one more trip.

1133
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.500
That'll take care of our executive session for today.

1134
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:15.500
And there's only one other thing I've got to mention that I've been a little bit remiss on.

1135
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:37.000
We've been asked as committees, standing committees, to create subcommittees within ourselves to go over the rules process as rules are adopted, just to make sure that whatever's being adopted in rules stays consistent with the intent of the legislation that was passed.

1136
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.500
So I'm looking for volunteers.

1137
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.500
We need four people.

1138
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:52.000
It was three originally, but I guess we're looking at, we're looking at two of each now, two Democrats, two Republicans.

1139
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Think about it.

1140
01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:03.000
If it's something you want to do, I believe Representative Sykes are automatically going to be on it.

1141
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I'm just looking forward to having something else to do.

1142
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
So we're looking at a couple more volunteers.

1143
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:24.000
And again, this is just to go over the rules per committee, just to make sure that the rules are consistent with the intent.

1144
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.500
What we can do, think about it.

1145
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:37.000
When we do come back on the 14th, then I'll look to solidify that committee with the four names.

1146
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.500
So is there anything else for the good of the cause?

1147
01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.500
Yes, sir.

1148
01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Yep.

1149
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.500
Mr.

1150
01:37:48.500 --> 01:38:00.500
Chairman, as we only have three bills to take up on the 14th, is it possible we could take them up in the afternoon?

1151
01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:12.500
And the reason I ask quite candidly is I have a doctor's appointment, and I would much rather be here than not be here.

1152
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:21.500
But if I have to choose between the two, I'm going to the doctor's, given my recent events.

1153
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:29.000
I had already had it in my mind we were going to do early morning.

1154
01:38:29.000 --> 01:39:10.500
We'll talk after the fact, but I think for other reasons reasons i need to keep it in the morning as well so but we'll talk afterwards all right all right anything else for the good of the cause representative platt i just want to say this was real tough duty thank you for allowing me to participate well thank you we try to keep it efficient i would have been even more efficient if we had gotten through all eight of them.

1155
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.000
Well, thanks very much, everybody.

1156
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
We'll see you in a couple of weeks.

1157
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And for those that made motions, they would like to give me some reports.

1158
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I do have copies in the office if you don't have the online format.

1159
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Can we email them to somebody?

1160
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.500
You can email them to me, yeah.

1161
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500
Okay.

1162
01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:48.500
If you want to use online, email them to me so I can go over them, as always.

1163
01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.500
Thank you.

1164
01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.500
Thank you.

1165
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.500
Thank you.
