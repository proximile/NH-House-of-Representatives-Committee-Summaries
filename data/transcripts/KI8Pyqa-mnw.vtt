foreign

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
hope everyone
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
survive without broken pipes and
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
cars that were frozen and everything
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
else it looks like it's going to be a
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
balmy 80 degrees today
 
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
um in here
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
I think I'd like to start if the work
 
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
session first with a pledge and ask our
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the flag of the United States of
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which it
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
stands one nation under God indivisible
 
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we neglected to do
 
00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
that last time and
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I am opening the
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
work session
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
um on House Bill 301 that I introduced
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.730 align:start position:0%
last week
um

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
for those
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
that are new to work sessions
 
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
um you can think of it almost as an
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
executive session but in a much less
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
formal way
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to try it so that we don't have
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
to do things through the chair we can
 
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 align:start position:0%
toss out ideas as we go
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
I would only ask that if you have
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
something to say that you still have to
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
use your your microphone and that will
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
indicate who to everyone else who wants
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 align:start position:0%
as far as the content
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's anything to do anything that's
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
written on both sides well on mine it's
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
both sides of this sheet of paper or any
 
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
other idea on conflicts of interest and
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
and ethics is in general
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
um with everyone without exception
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
without objection I'd like to let um our
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
very fine uh ethics Guru
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
um Rich Lambert who's in the room
 
00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
um also be able to participate and um
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
and answer any of our questions that we
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
have as they come along
 
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:10.220 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make sure we understood that
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
this bill is now in the hands of the
 
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.409 align:start position:0%
this bill is now in the hands of the
committee

00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so all of the names that are on there
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
don't matter it is our committee bill at
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
this point so
 
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.749 align:start position:0%
this point so
um

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
um don't think that there's any
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh concern with
 
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.329 align:start position:0%
uh concern with
um

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
saying anything you want to I have very
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
thick skin even though my name is the
 
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539 align:start position:0%
first one on there it doesn't matter it
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
is your it is all of our bill rather
 
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:45.740 align:start position:0%
than just mine okay
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.490 align:start position:0%
that being said
um

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.050 align:start position:0%
um
I

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
would like to just start out and maybe
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
start the the conversation rolling
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
by saying
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
um we have to decide somewhere and I
 
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
think right off the bat what's the
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.190 align:start position:0%
purpose of
having

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.630 align:start position:0%
having
this

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
um this section of our ethics booklet
 
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
is it to determine or or to provide the
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
a sheet
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
to determine guilt or innocence or is it
 
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:29.180 align:start position:0%
as I think
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
something that provides guide guidelines
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
I guess or suggestions or advice to our
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
fellow legislators to decide
 
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.650 align:start position:0%
fellow legislators to decide
um

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
how they
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
should be acting or or just a I don't
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
know brotherly advice is the right thing
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
but just some way some some offer of or
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
indication of how
 
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.690 align:start position:0%
indication of how
um

00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
you should have what you should have as
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
a guideline while you're determining
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
whether you have a problem or not with a
 
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.230 align:start position:0%
whether you have a problem or not with a
conflict

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.490 align:start position:0%
conflict
so

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
um that's that's what I think if anybody
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
wants to come up with a better solution
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
or a better idea of what that booklet is
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
the reason I bring it up is
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
if there is any concerns that I receive
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
back or feedback from any of the uh
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
people that have read it it's that
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
phrase in there that talks about people
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
who are close to you
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
and and funnily enough and I mentioned
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
this to someone over the weekend funnily
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
enough the people that had the most
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
problem with that are people that come
 
00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:47.779 align:start position:0%
from the legal background
 
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
so the lawyers don't like that phrase
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and I and I maintain it's because
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
they are hoping to have they're used to
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
working with things that that give them
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
a sense of
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
guilt or innocence from how the wording
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
is is done and I'm not looking at it
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
from that standpoint
 
00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:11.810 align:start position:0%
from that standpoint
um so

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.670 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
I guess rather than just keep wandering
 
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
around here I'm happy to entertain
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
anybody else's thoughts about the
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
purpose of this and where we go from
 
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.130 align:start position:0%
purpose of this and where we go from
here

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
Allison

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
hi so I also didn't like the someone the
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
legislator cares about um I thought it
 
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
I thought it thought it really
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
fell apart if like someone were to like
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know like need to pay back a
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
debt or something like that and it was a
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
which like I hope no one's doing but
 
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.990 align:start position:0%
which like I hope no one's doing but
like

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would also be a conflict of
 
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.569 align:start position:0%
that would also be a conflict of
interest

00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
um so I had I just looked up like
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts conflict of interest laws
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and I got that language drafted as an
 
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.610 align:start position:0%
um and I got that language drafted as an
amendment

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
um if we wanted to look at it if not I'm
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
fine with that
 
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.530 align:start position:0%
fine with that
Jesus

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:08.540 align:start position:0%
Jesus
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
that reminds me did anybody receive from
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
Jennifer the
 
00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:15.230 align:start position:0%
Jennifer the
um

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think she's done it yet I had
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
um I forget I think it was uh
 
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative payer that asked if we
 
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
had examples from other states
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
what's that we did receive that yeah we
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
have all 50 states it's categorized okay
 
00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:34.019 align:start position:0%
in two separate that might have even
 
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
come from me now that I think of it I'm
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
there were a number of them that that we
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
no didn't see it
 
00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.310 align:start position:0%
no didn't see it
okay

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
I feel like I saw it but I didn't check
 
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:50.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
this is the danger all right
 
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.210 align:start position:0%
this is the danger all right
February

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
February
 
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
first okay so that's just last week
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah and that had every every
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
state listed right because I also have
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
from our work session over the summer
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
when we interim studied the bill I have
 
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.090 align:start position:0%
when we interim studied the bill I have
um

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
a sheet that we handed out then
 
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
and that just has some language from
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
other so from select States Oklahoma
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
being one of them Rhode Island Virginia
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
and and they'll those are the ones that
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
spoke to us as we're looking through
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
that entire list that we're talking
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
about you still need it all right
 
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.009 align:start position:0%
about you still need it all right
um

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
okay but you did receive the one from
 
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.870 align:start position:0%
okay but you did receive the one from
Jennifer

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.389 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
why don't you give me
 
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
the email addresses that you want that
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
sent to and I'll try to do it while
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking here
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then you'll have it
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
uh everybody else is okay with that
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
everybody else has it already
 
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.850 align:start position:0%
everybody else has it already
okay

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
um so what was it specifically
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
um representative Allison
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
um nutting Wong what is it that
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
you felt that the
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the phrase didn't cover all instances
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay so here's another part of
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
that and maybe we jumped ahead a little
 
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.769 align:start position:0%
that and maybe we jumped ahead a little
bit

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
another part of it is deter first
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
determining from this committee how far
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
from the legislator do we need to go
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
is it some states you'll see only go as
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
far as the legislator you that's where
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
the conflict begins and ends some others
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at the legislator and the spouse
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
some others look at the legislative
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
spouse and anyone that lives in your
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
household or is an immediate family
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
member and so on
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
I think that phrase that we used in here
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
encompasses all of those people and then
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
goes another step but maybe you want to
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
add it even further and say you know
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
someone that has debts you know whatever
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
the phrase yeah
 
00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:16.019 align:start position:0%
um help yourself yep
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
I was specifically asked by my employer
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
to recuse myself from any bill that
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
would benefit them financially for any
 
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
Broadband type infrastructure bill
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
because that's who I work for so could
 
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
that be considered somebody you know
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
close to the legislator the employer I
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
would think so that's actually already
 
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that's that part that that you
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney were were talking
 
00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:51.470 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney were were talking
about

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
um advocating for
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
or acting as an advocate in this case
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
should be acting as an advocate for and
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's another section as well well
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
right in the in the new language part C
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
says this person persons may or may not
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
include family members friends or
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
business associates and I would consider
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
that a business associate
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
yep by the way we have
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
um a lot of you haven't met
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
representative Constable representative
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
Constable watched us on TV last week uh
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
or or the week before I don't remember
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
now you can match the name to the face
 
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.449 align:start position:0%
now you can match the name to the face
so

00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
sure where to go with that
 
00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.870 align:start position:0%
sure where to go with that
um

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
so um so again we you know I
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
we have certain sections that we could
 
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
either Silo this and just say okay what
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
do we think first of all how far from
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
that legislator we should go
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
and then set that aside and go to the
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
next section or we can
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
um you know shotgun this and go anywhere
 
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
we want to go
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
um what's the pleasure
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
if you do it to where you put in
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
specifics instead of someone the
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislature cares about if you actually
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
put in uh relations and you go out to a
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
certain point
 
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:24.500 align:start position:0%
but then A legislature a legislator
 
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
cares more about two sections out or two
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
relationships out the new named
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
does he have to report it
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
is he guilty can he be thrown out
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
what gives
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
because somebody the legislator cares
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
about that's up to the legislator
 
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:44.900 align:start position:0%
that's not up to somebody else to say
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't like your grandchildren
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
for anybody who's got them
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
or at least certain ones of your
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I don't like your
 
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I don't like your
grandchildren

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
and I've got 10 of them
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
but I mean
 
00:17:58.919 --> 00:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
but I mean
so

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
but if you've got great grandkids maybe
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
you care more about them than somebody
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
closer up but they're not listed this
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
lists them
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
without listing them I agree and our
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
point was to try to get away from
 
00:18:17.169 --> 00:18:17.179 align:start position:0%
being a
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
genealogy band you know I don't want to
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
have to list every possible relationship
 
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
have to list every possible relationship
that

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
could fall into this cat into the
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
category that you would have to worry
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
about because certainly there may be
 
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.549 align:start position:0%
about because certainly there may be
somebody's

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
somebody's
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
stepfather's sister that you know you
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
that is in the same business that you're
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
voting on a an issue for that would help
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
them but I don't I don't that's why I
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
was trying to get away or we were trying
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
to get away from the
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
the guilt or innocence part of it
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
because certainly there would be a
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
loophole if you didn't name the specific
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
relationship that's what we're trying to
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
get away from what's that and that's why
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
the lawyers like that well there you go
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
yeah well I'm not going there
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
um but but I think that's part of it and
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
and so again I think a fundamental
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
question is trying to determine exactly
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish with
 
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
having this phraseology in an Ethics
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
book I don't know that that's well maybe
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Lambert can tell us has has that been
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
discussed in a
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
in an overall 30 000 foot view
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
um of what's the purpose of this ethics
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
book I know that they use the word
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines in places and I know
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
but but it seems that when you sit and
 
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.529 align:start position:0%
but but it seems that when you sit and
and

00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh discuss a complaint
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
you are seeking to determine guilt or
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
innocence at that point
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
um and that's what makes it
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
more of a question though but but that
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's still a guideline like they doesn't
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
that then come to a vote so it still
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
comes down to the house deciding right
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
on the ethics comes up with a
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
recommendation and they come up with a
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
recommendation right it's not guilt or
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's like we believe this per this
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
legislator should be censored perhaps or
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
expelled for something and then it comes
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
to the house right and then we have to
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
vote on it so it's still
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know it's not to me it's not a guilt
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
strictly written as law right it's more
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
to your point to me it feels more like a
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
guideline for legislators to when should
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
you recuse yourself and and it shouldn't
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
just be I agree that it shouldn't just
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
be family members right or business so
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
it should we should take that leap but
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
getting the wording right is a little
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
tricky as I think is
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.650 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
yeah

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
um I think the problem that I think with
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
this is that when we're using household
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
members it's easy to prove who your
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
household member is it isn't difficult
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
to prove who your friends are we're
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
having to write down our household
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
members and what you know conflicts we
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
might have because of where they work if
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
we get to going further and further out
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
I mean when we fill out our our ethics
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
sheet instead of just including
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
household members how like do we have to
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
write like our first 50 friends do we
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
have you know I mean like it gets it's
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
sort of it I understand the purpose of
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
it it's like a best practices guideline
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
more than than anything but like if
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
we're getting what we do here when we're
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
writing a law is unfortunately legal you
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
know it becomes important that we know a
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
distinction between whether somebody's
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
breaking the law or not breaking law
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
because we've created the law by putting
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
in special persons so that's I think
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
that that's what worries me is there
 
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
some way that
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
you could just move it to a best
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
practices thing and uh you know maybe
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
the the rules regarding whether or not
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
somebody gets brought up on ethics
 
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.270 align:start position:0%
somebody gets brought up on ethics
charges

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:16.700 align:start position:0%
remains just household as opposed to
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
well I know this guy's friend does this
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
thing so I'm gonna complain sort of
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
stuff so that's my two cents yep anyone
 
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.090 align:start position:0%
stuff so that's my two cents yep anyone
else

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
I look at it as
 
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.100 align:start position:0%
one shoot morning
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
this probably tells you more about me
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
than anything else but I Envision the
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
poor guy the poor representative that's
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
sitting in the middle of a row
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
um so having difficulty getting in and
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
out and listening to testimony
 
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:00.380 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden a name or a face or
 
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
someone he cares about someone he knows
 
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
he is identifying with that testimony
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
and he's thinking to himself
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
gee should I not you know am I crossing
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
a line here by voting on this issue and
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
and he doesn't have his family attorney
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
on speed dial so he does you know so he
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
can't find a quick answer I'm I think
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of the book to and I
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
would like we talked about it last year
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
when we had the other bill
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
I would like to almost have a a one
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
little laminated sheet that
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
um that everyone is given that just says
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
um whatever we come up with out of here
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you have someone that you're
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
close to or someone whatever we end up
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
coming up with and they can just look at
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
it and we had talked about a decision
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
tree you know just having
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
um you know is this an issue that you
 
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
are aware of someone your your business
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
handling or whatever and coming down
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
just so that that person sitting in that
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
seat would have a better feel
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
for what they should do
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
and know that at the very end
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
if you still decide to go ahead and vote
 
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
you are potentially opening yourself up
 
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
to a complaint
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
and or
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
tarnishing your
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
reputation and our reputation
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
collectively that's that's how
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
my mind has worked as we were working
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
through different work sessions and
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on the prior Bill all
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
of that that's that's how I'm trying to
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
reach a conclusion on this I don't know
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
if that helps or hurts we also have an
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
added Advantage aside from having Mr
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
Lambert here we also have another member
 
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:09.020 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee and I don't know
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
how Janet that this
 
00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:13.870 align:start position:0%
how Janet that this
um

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
interferes with your you know where
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
where are your
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
where where do you yeah I don't know if
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
this interferes with your ability to do
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
your job in the other committee or here
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
not at all
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
um actually I some of us were wishing
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
that we had this Workshop or whatever
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're calling it this morning after the
 
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:37.580 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee meets next Monday
 
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
because chairman of the Ethics Committee
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
former State Rep and former Senator Ned
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
Gordon is drafting language to help us
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
and he is very skilled at what he does
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
in a very brief and understanding way
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
um but I I think we're going the right
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
direction everyone's struggling with
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
this at this point and this doesn't
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
interfere with our work at all I had
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned to our chairman some weeks ago
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the only thing I came up with was
 
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
someone with whom the legislator is
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
closely associated rather than someone
 
00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:14.779 align:start position:0%
you're close to
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
and representative nutting Wong has come
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
up with a wonderful beautiful amendment
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
that she's actually had drafted could we
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we have the same problem with
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
someone that is closely associated I
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
would think that that's also is
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
what what you think is closer closely
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
associated right right yeah I that's
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
what I that's my initial reaction anyway
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
it's a chair yes Steve hi
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
um oh sorry a lot of a lot of these
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
terms that we're throwing around here
 
00:26:53.409 --> 00:26:53.419 align:start position:0%
are going to have to be
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily defined
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
in a very rigid way because a lot of
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
these terms are ambiguous
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
they're subject to
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
mountain of interpretation
 
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.750 align:start position:0%
mountain of interpretation
and

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
I have I have concerns when we talk
 
00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:17.299 align:start position:0%
about cares or
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
Associates or
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'd need to know what that I mean okay I
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
went I went to college with people that
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
does that make them my associate does
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
someone I went to high school with make
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
them my associate does
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
is the Ethics Committee going to want my
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
because when you use a loose term like
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
that people Define it in their own head
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
right it's
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
we look at that and go okay well in my
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
mind it means this
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
well that's all well and good
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
but in
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
representative payer's mind that might
 
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
mean something different
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
and of course when you get in front of
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee
 
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.830 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee
there

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
not necessarily even going to agree with
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
something that's that's not rigidly
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
defined because in their head
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
they have a definition as well so
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it's we can talk about
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
generic terms like this but if we're if
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to include a definition
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
of those terms with it and discuss a
 
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.909 align:start position:0%
of those terms with it and discuss a
definition

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
then we're going to kind of be I don't
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
know if we're really solving anything as
 
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
a as a collective
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
so I um
 
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.669 align:start position:0%
so I um
I think

00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
the fact that you came in a few minutes
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
after the time we had talked that was
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
part of our original discussion of
 
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
whether we should have defined terms and
 
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
the fact that some some have not
 
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
appreciated the term those you care
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
about and and maybe now associate with
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
because you have to decide first
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson weather
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
what your purpose with this booklet is
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
is it to determine guilt or innocence or
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
is it and and that's where I think
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
um it sounds your headed so that so that
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
the um something is
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
is black and white or or uh
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
defined as to use your term in order to
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
um make that clear determination like we
 
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.500 align:start position:0%
do in a in a court
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
of any
 
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.490 align:start position:0%
of any
substance

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
substance
 
00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:38.419 align:start position:0%
or is instead the booklet
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
there as a guideline to an aid the
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
representatives or the representatives
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
and Senators to determine
 
00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
because ultimately ethics is
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
what you think it is I in my in my
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
opinion ethics is what you do when no
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
one else is looking
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so for me it is more a guideline than
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
it is something that guilt or innocence
 
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
is going to be determined on if if you
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
think that this person that your college
 
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.130 align:start position:0%
think that this person that your college
friend

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
friend
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
is to use the definitions that are on
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
the in the in the bill now
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
if you think your college
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
um roommate is someone that you care
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
about to the point that you would change
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
how you're voting because of your
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that person then yes
 
00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:37.909 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that person then yes
um that's

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's who we're talking about
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
um but if it's somebody that is
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know lives in your house that um
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
your son or daughter brought in
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and you don't know them then maybe
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
not you know that's that's where I'm
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
going well I can appreciate that there's
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
other folks on the committee that are
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
thinking along the same lines that I am
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
sorry about my tardiness but
 
00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:04.810 align:start position:0%
sorry about my tardiness but
um

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:04.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
definition of ethics I don't disagree
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
with it's in here except when you walk
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
when you sit before the Ethics Committee
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
your personal opinion
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
is now really not it's part of the
 
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.970 align:start position:0%
is now really not it's part of the
equation

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
equation
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
but you are sitting in in front of an
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee board who's deciding
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not you violated the ethics
 
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.269 align:start position:0%
whether or not you violated the ethics
standard

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
so it's all well and good that your
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is framed in such a
 
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.090 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is framed in such a
manner

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
but the Ethics Committee is going to
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
make a decision
 
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
on the complaint that's brought before
 
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.210 align:start position:0%
on the complaint that's brought before
them

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
goes outside the scope of what you think
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
you did
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that in the guidebook that you're
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
referring to I presume will be part
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
of that ethics hearing
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
so that's not just a guidebook for the
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
individual legislator that's a guidebook
 
00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:12.059 align:start position:0%
for the Ethics Committee as well
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
well maybe
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
maybe you would like to comment on that
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I didn't see the hand well
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
I I understand where you're coming from
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
but it's critical as legislators that we
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
all understand if we step over a line
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
there are problems and I have brought up
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
before this committee before and well
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
again the fact that uh when I sat on
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
Judiciary we had a number of members who
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
were landlords and we also had a number
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
of bills that were landlord tenant bills
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
and it was very very important that
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
right up front these people say I'm a
 
00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
landlord and yet this is what I believe
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this is my experience and so forth
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
if the person did not do that which did
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
happen that causes a problem because a
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
landlord clearly has uh different
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
opinions from a renter
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
and this this this is why we have to
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
have definitions and this whole issue of
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest I have an article
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
in front of me from the New York Times
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
last week with the U.S Supreme Court one
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
of the wives of the Chief Justice
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
actually his wife
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
um being questioned
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
because of a possible conflict of
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
interest and that substantiated my
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
opinion in terms of the concept of
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh conflict of interest how did I work
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
let's see the legislator or one who is
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
closely associated with the legislator
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
or the issues with which the legislator
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
is dealing and again
 
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:50.539 align:start position:0%
um Allison excuse me
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
representative Allison netting Wong has
 
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
carried a step further and to clarify
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
and I think you might want to hear that
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely I just want to make notice
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
that the clerk did not mention a single
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
person recuse themselves from a vote we
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
took last week involving landlords
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to tell me that 400
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
members of of our house not a single one
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
of them owns rental property
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
I think you're crazy I think the number
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
is 40.
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
40 that own yeah okay not a single the
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
clerk did not mention a single recusal
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
so are we looking under the under this
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
proposed idea in 301 here are we looking
 
00:34:34.089 --> 00:34:34.099 align:start position:0%
at 40 ethics violations
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
I'd like to respond to that if I may
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
please remember it's not just the single
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
type of uh issue you're talking about
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
you have to associate a lot of the other
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
parts of the guidelines it's critical
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
that we disclose that's why we have our
 
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
disclosure forms and these that's how we
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but we do that now we're
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
asking to change this we do that already
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
I already I filled it out three times
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
in the three terms I've been here
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
so you're asking for a change we're not
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
I don't think where any of us are
 
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
debating whether we should have ethics
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
guidelines of course we should we
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
currently do what we're talking about
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
here is changing those guidelines from
 
00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
what we have to something different
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
we're talking about clarification
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
because there has been some concern
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
among all members who have paid
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
attention to this and it's not to
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
criticize anybody but as all members who
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
have looked into this are concerned
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
about the definition of conflict of
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
interest and that's why this committee
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
is struggling to more clearly Define
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.470 align:start position:0%
that thank you
what

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to lose sight of the
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
fact that what prompted this bill and
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
most of the wording in this bill came
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
from the chair of Ethics last year who
 
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.550 align:start position:0%
from the chair of Ethics last year who
who

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and if you read the first four Roman
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
sections here specifically called for a
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
change to how that book is so it it's
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
not that we're
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's it you're absolutely right we are
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
talking about a change but we're not
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
dreaming it up out of thin air we're
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're taking it from
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
the request of the chair of Ethics who
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
feels that they need that that's that's
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
the point but I agree I mean we are
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.770 align:start position:0%
at some point
um

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative McCarter had a question
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if we've already gone
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
past that or not yep
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
so I am
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
thinking this out loud here uh forgive
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
it's on us to recuse ourselves from
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
something that would obviously
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
financially benefit myself my family
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
members who people we care deeply about
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
okay what if uh
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
my neighbor two doors down his wife
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
works at X company and something that's
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
coming up is going to impact her company
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
I don't know that's where she works
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
however she's my next door neighbor two
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
door's down what if somebody else
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
um on the legislator wanted to initiate
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
an Ethics complaint against me because
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
my neighbor two doors down works at X
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
company that I don't know it now it's on
 
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.849 align:start position:0%
company that I don't know it now it's on
me

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
to determine uh
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
that course of action I I
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to navigate this that
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
what's the procedure what is the
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
procedure who who who uh lodges those
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
complaints is it uh
 
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
who defends it later so so we have two
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
people they can walk you through the
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
system go why don't you explain if
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to file that complaint
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
and thought that you had done something
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
that you shouldn't have voted or or
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
should have disclosed that this neighbor
 
00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:07.310 align:start position:0%
should have disclosed that this neighbor
was

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
how how would it operate go ahead
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
rich is here he can correct me if I'm
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
wrong on this one
 
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
um it depends on how close you are to
 
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:17.780 align:start position:0%
that neighbor if that neighbor has
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
considerable influence over your
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
opinions and your actions then it is
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's best if you do
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
disclose and recuse yourself if you feel
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
that you cannot be objective when it
 
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:33.020 align:start position:0%
comes to your decision making
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
I respect that I get that however uh
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
let's say someone else doesn't
 
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm able to make that
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
barrier and I'm able to make that
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
differentiation somebody else just knows
 
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
that so and so lives two doors down for
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
me and it probably did influence they
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
don't know that it didn't but they can
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
Lodge that complaint against me or you
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
or you anyhow where is the line that uh
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know who's off limits at that point
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
my my uh
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
former neighbor that moved to Florida
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
and his brother owns a company in
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
Nashville I mean like where where's the
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
line drawn
 
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:23.470 align:start position:0%
line drawn
foreign

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
this is me speaking not
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you know any official ethics
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not a member of the Ethics
 
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.650 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not a member of the Ethics
Committee

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
um no one can stop
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
another person from filing a complaint
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
against you right
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
so it would be then the job of the
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
ask you to appear before them and and
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
they would ask you to explain
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
what you've just gone through
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
um this is my neighbor I see them yeah
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
you can make up any story you want you
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
know I I don't know the the complete
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
scenario but
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
but then they would judge
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
the veracity of what you're saying and
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
they would decide whether there was an
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
Ethics whether it was justifiable for
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
them to file an Ethics complaint against
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
you or not
 
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.589 align:start position:0%
you or not
um

00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
we were somewhat careful in here to say
 
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.930 align:start position:0%
we were somewhat careful in here to say
that

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
um you know this person just because
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
they lived there
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily mean that you
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have voted that way anyway and
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
if and that
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know really how the ethics can
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
can judge that other than from what you
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
say in your frame of mind you know I
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
yes I am aware that that they're in that
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
business but here is how I evoted in the
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
past in these types of issues or
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.069 align:start position:0%
something like that
um

00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
I it it will ultimately come down to
 
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
you're defending yourself against this
 
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.530 align:start position:0%
you're defending yourself against this
complaint

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
all I'm trying to say is
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
this booklet needs to be your
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
warning I hate using that word but your
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
title yeah you you need to be aware that
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
when you vote a certain way if you
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
choose to and not recuse yourself then
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
you are opening yourself up to that
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
ability to have a complaint lodged
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
against you which you will have to
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
answer to Is that does that answer what
 
00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
answer to Is that does that answer what
okay

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to or
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this meeting
 
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.970 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this meeting
yep

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term the activist
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
types to Lodge ethics complaints against
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
people absolutely I'm just I I agree
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Pearson that it
 
00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:10.820 align:start position:0%
needs to be dialed in and very finitely
 
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.370 align:start position:0%
needs to be dialed in and very finitely
itemized

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:12.380 align:start position:0%
itemized
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
because once it's out there in the media
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
it isn't coming back it's out there and
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
right but it's within your power
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
to not have that be a weapon used
 
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
against you
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's that's the point and we don't
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
have that weapon
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
according to the chair of Ethics he is
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
in he believes that there is a need for
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
you to be able to defend yourself
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:49.940 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
going back to my Commerce experience we
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
disclose things all the time but we we
 
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
rarely recuse ourselves from votes I
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
mean we're a citizen legislature so a
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
lot of the people that were on Commerce
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
had were business owners or landlords or
 
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know I served that you know going
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
back I live in a house now but at the
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
time I was living in a trailer park and
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
we had trailer park pills right so what
 
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:15.500 align:start position:0%
we would do is disclose that information
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
and put up front and to the to the
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
public and to especially an executive
 
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
committee we would disclose that this is
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
my conflict and but that we will
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
participate and I think that should
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
still be an option going forward so I
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
have a little issue with like
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
um where it says the legislative
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
legislator shall recuse himself I think
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
it should be may may recuse or disclose
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to force us to oh
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
Commerce won't get done Commerce
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
Committee would not get done
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
okay because there would be
 
00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:51.370 align:start position:0%
okay because there would be
um

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:51.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
exactly and then what you would have to
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
do is then take the people that have the
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
expertise in those committees and take
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
them all for the committee
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and have them serve somewhere where
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
they have no experience and I don't
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
think that's what we want to do but what
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
we do want to do is make sure that we as
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
legislators as a citizen volunteer
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislator that we're disclosing that I
 
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
am a landlord but I will be
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
participating in this vote and and have
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
a clear conscience about that where you
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
should recuse yourself is where the
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
influence would change your vote right
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to vote one way and
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
that's how you feel intellectually
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's how you're going there's no
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
conflict there's you you disclose an
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
interest but it's you don't have to
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself because that's how
 
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
you're voting where you need to recuse
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
yourself and this is a personal thing is
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
when that interest would change your
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
vote from a yes to a no from a no to a
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
yes that's right that's the ethical
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
violation and that's what it says and
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's what it says right but well up up
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
until 14c Dash Aces the legislator shall
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
recusing himself or herself from voting
 
00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.849 align:start position:0%
recusing himself or herself from voting
um

00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
where you know probably should be more
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
of a May recuse or disclose something
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
like that I don't think I disagree with
 
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
that there is also I and I don't think
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
this has been brought up but you
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
reminded me
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
um because we are a citizen legislature
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
that we discussed heavily
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe more heavily than anything
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
we've talked about here now was the fact
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to
 
00:45:26.579 --> 00:45:30.430 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to
stifle

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
specialized information that that the
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislator may have because of their
 
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
life experience so we specifically said
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
um under the exclusions or somewhere
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
here that if
 
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
if you are in committee or even on the
 
00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
floor if you wanted to discuss or
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
testify or or that would just be done
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
with a disclosure as it is now
 
00:46:07.569 --> 00:46:07.579 align:start position:0%
it was only the voting that we were
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
suggesting would be the recusal part of
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
it so we didn't want to lose the
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge I'll call it I
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't think that's a
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
perfect term but
 
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.130 align:start position:0%
perfect term but
um

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:21.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
and we didn't want to I don't know if uh
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
this is the right term either but
 
00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:31.579 align:start position:0%
um disenfranchised that person's
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
constituents that they represent
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
and they would be able to then testify
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
um with that disclosure and say I am a
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
landlord I am a you know a policeman I
 
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
am a whatever you want to say
 
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.589 align:start position:0%
am a whatever you want to say
however

00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:49.550 align:start position:0%
however
um

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
at that point from that point on we felt
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
um the suggestion would be not the shall
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
but the suggestion would be that you
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
avoid the possibility of
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
a complaint being filed by disclosing
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what this says that's
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
what I that's how I read it
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
yep sorry
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
I just have one question on
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
or for some clarification at the
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
beginning it says real or perceived
 
00:47:22.859 --> 00:47:24.770 align:start position:0%
beginning it says real or perceived
benefit

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.109 align:start position:0%
benefit
um

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
perceived by whom perceived by the
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
legislator himself or perceived by the
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
no it's also in I'm sorry it also is in
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh I'm also talking about what the laws
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
what was your thought but either of
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
those with perceived I'm curious though
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
same but I was also trying to keep like
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
avoid the definitions of like an
 
00:47:54.359 --> 00:47:55.430 align:start position:0%
avoid the definitions of like an
interest

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
because it says um so in the original
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
Bill we have it says real or perceived
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
financial interest or non-financial
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
personal interest so in my amendment I
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
had real or perceived benefit Financial
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
or otherwise and at the end of the day
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
it's about whoever complains about you
 
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
like however they feel about it
 
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.470 align:start position:0%
like however they feel about it
like

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
um so it doesn't really matter what we
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
think but like you can get an Ethics
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
complaint about anything
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
um whether or not it's found to be
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
anything is another question I
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand that but that's why I'm
 
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
saying that I I myself can't recuse
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
myself from something because I didn't
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
understand that somebody else in the
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire would think that
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
I had a financial interest if it says
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
real or perceived by the legislator then
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
it's like yeah I think I might have a
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
financial interest in this so I
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that that seems to make
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
more sense than just any but they all
 
00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099 align:start position:0%
think we have a financial interest in
 
00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:50.930 align:start position:0%
think we have a financial interest in
this

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
so uh anyhow thanks
 
00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.210 align:start position:0%
so uh anyhow thanks
sure

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
can someone tell me who is able to fill
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
out a complaint
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
who can Lodge a complaint against a
 
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.970 align:start position:0%
who can Lodge a complaint against a
legislator

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
anybody anyone public
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
anybody anyone from the public another
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's long
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
as long as
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're aware of what our guidelines are
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
and what the real complaint should be it
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
there are people who do file complaints
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
that have nothing to do with the
 
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.290 align:start position:0%
that have nothing to do with the
committee

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
so it behooves people to make themselves
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with what constitutes an
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
ethical violation could we please hear
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
from Rich Lambert I think he could just
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
thank you I did have a follow-up real
 
00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:45.650 align:start position:0%
thank you I did have a follow-up real
quick

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the process is for
 
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.950 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the process is for
complaints

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
does the complaint go in front of the
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
yes yes and we're accelerating step by
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
step what to do okay
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
you can bring the microphone over there
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
well there are four
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
steps in a complaint one is when the
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee receives a complaint they need
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
to examine it and at that point they can
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
discharge it and so the situation that
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
representative MacArthur was describing
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
sounds like something that would be a
 
00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:35.900 align:start position:0%
candidate but discharge if a neighbor to
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
house is down filed a complaint against
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
you for having
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
um if someone follows a plan to get you
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
for the fact that you know someone two
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
doors down from you
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
that would probably be discharged
 
00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.349 align:start position:0%
that would probably be discharged
because

00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that that didn't
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
violate anything either currently or in
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
I would think can't speak for them but
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
the next step would be in initial review
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
and that's when the committee looks to
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
see if something is the complaint is
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
within their jurisdiction
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
and has Merit and at that point the
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee can dismiss the complaint and
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
unless the respondent waived
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
confidentiality all of that would be
 
00:51:18.599 --> 00:51:20.329 align:start position:0%
confidentiality all of that would be
confidential

00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:20.339 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
the next stage would be the preliminary
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
investigation that too would be
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
confidential and then the stage after
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a formal hearing which is
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
open it's like a trial
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
so that is the process when the
 
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
committee receives a complaint it needs
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
to be the claim needs to be sworn to
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
before a JP or a notary and it's
 
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:44.339 align:start position:0%
confidentially filed and then supplied
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
to the committee members and to the
 
00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:50.030 align:start position:0%
to the committee members and to the
respondent

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
can you speak to thank you for that um
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
those answers
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
um can you can you speak to any of the
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say issues or
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
situations but
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
but why are we why at this time was did
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
indicate that we needed these changes
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
without speaking for him I understand
 
00:52:17.579 --> 00:52:18.770 align:start position:0%
without speaking for him I understand
but

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.630 align:start position:0%
but
because

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
there is no place in the booklet
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
currently which requires recusal as
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
chairman Gordon said you won't find that
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
word in the booklet
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
and there were several situations
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
several complaints which arose and also
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
a request for an advisory opinion
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
describing situations and or involving a
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
situation or two where the legislator
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
thought he only needed to disclose but
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
it was found that he had both of them
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
had violated the section of the
 
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:51.980 align:start position:0%
guidelines called prohibited activities
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
which is on page
 
00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:01.490 align:start position:0%
which is on page
four

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
in the first paragraph
 
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
specifically says that disclosure does
 
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.970 align:start position:0%
specifically says that disclosure does
not

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.809 align:start position:0%
not
um

00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
save you so to speak from the
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
activities which are listed as being
 
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.690 align:start position:0%
activities which are listed as being
prohibited

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
and so if you are being paid by an
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
organization to advocate for them
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
that would violate
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
several of these Provisions under
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
three to a through G
 
00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:32.420 align:start position:0%
and that was what was found to have been
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
violated in two complaints
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
and also was talked about in The
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
in The Advisory opinion it was
 
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.190 align:start position:0%
in The Advisory opinion it was
um

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'll summarize as go forth and sin no
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
more kind of approach
 
00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:54.650 align:start position:0%
more kind of approach
where

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
would it is it fair to say that head
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
something like man this is a hard
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
question for you to answer but something
 
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
like what was available Lander 301 here
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
would have helped the committee
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
do more than just say go forth and sin
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
no more is that well I would hope that
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
it would have helped the
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
member not to have right not to I've got
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
to that point yes because the committee
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the two opinions two rulings in the
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
two cases both were resolved by informal
 
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.030 align:start position:0%
two cases both were resolved by informal
resolution

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
stated that the violations were probably
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
inadvertent because the legislator felt
 
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.329 align:start position:0%
inadvertent because the legislator felt
that

00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
so but but the informal resolutions
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
were was agreed to as they need to be by
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
the respondent and both times the
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
respondent agreed not to vote on to he
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
agreed to recuse on anything that
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
what um
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'll keep jumping in here unless
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to jump in at what
 
00:55:07.079 --> 00:55:09.530 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to jump in at what
point

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
are what's what's the general feeling
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
what's your general feeling whether is
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
this in order to prevent
 
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
um cases to come before the Ethics
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
Committee or and to advise or is it to
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
um almost be a
 
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.430 align:start position:0%
um almost be a
um

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
the litmus paper that someone is judged
 
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.130 align:start position:0%
the litmus paper that someone is judged
against

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:33.140 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
both there are five parts to this one is
 
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
the guidelines and sometimes I think the
 
00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
name can be confusing they're not it's
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
called guidelines but in many cases
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
it is you know mandatory it's not
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
something you choose to follow because
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like to and violations of the
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
guidelines can lead to reprimand censure
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
or expulsion
 
00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.030 align:start position:0%
or expulsion
um

00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
in many states that they would call that
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct
 
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
but here for whatever reason it was
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
originally named ethics guidelines
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
but functionally it is a color of
 
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.990 align:start position:0%
but functionally it is a color of
conduct

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
then there are two laws in the booklet
 
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
one establishes the Committees
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
powers and duties and that begins on
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
and that is I mean there are violation
 
00:56:27.849 --> 00:56:27.859 align:start position:0%
of that not only is a violation of the
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
ethics guidelines but in some cases
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
would be a misdemeanor
 
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
and then C RSA 14c which begins on 34 is
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
the Gift chapter
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
and violations of that also are a
 
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.390 align:start position:0%
and violations of that also are a
misdemeanor

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
then the fourth part of the procedural
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
rules of the committee but how they
 
00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.870 align:start position:0%
rules of the committee but how they
operate

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
um particularly with complaints and then
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
five has a number of other
 
00:56:57.010 --> 00:56:57.020 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous Provisions
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
including the policy on harassment
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
which you'll discuss later and also two
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
interpretive rulings which were put in
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
here to help clarify what to do in terms
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
of acceptance of money for trips or how
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
to comply with the disclosure provisions
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
that one begins on page 64.
 
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
I do you recall last year when we had
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
the original bill I don't remember the
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
number of it uh you do
 
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.490 align:start position:0%
number of it uh you do
um

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:30.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
1368. we had talked about a a decision
 
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
tree approach have you had any more
 
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts about that or or has anyone
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
played with that idea because that would
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
seem to me if it's possible
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
that would be more leaning towards the
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
preventative side of this so that we
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
would have
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
um you should probably let everyone know
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
we we are on a dangerous path of of
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
complaints as well the Ethics Committee
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
has a has had a precipitous number of
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
of complaints in the last couple years
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
so I would think the preventative side
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
of things needs to certainly be part of
 
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
our discussion here in this work session
 
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.349 align:start position:0%
our discussion here in this work session
so

00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
um that would be a great idea but I
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
haven't had to need to work on it I
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's something the Ethics
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
Committee can discuss next week also
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
does the has the Ethics Committee talked
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
at all about the possibility of having
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
some kind something to give to
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
Representatives other than a I don't
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
know how many pages we got here
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
representative wall has been a champion
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
68-page thing you know if you could get
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yes a couple page you know so that
 
00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:54.059 align:start position:0%
um that was we we have had that and I
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
um to build upon this whole issue of
 
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.530 align:start position:0%
um to build upon this whole issue of
disclosure

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
um on page 65 in the at the bottom and
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
Page 66 the Declaration of intent talks
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
about financial interests
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
um and that helps Define this whole
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
issue about if you have a neighbor who's
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the business or owns a business and
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
may have an influence over your vote
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
um it would have to go you'd have to
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
look at more than just that aspect of it
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
it would have to be and as it says here
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
if it affects you more or your household
 
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
remember whatever according to your
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
current definitions
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
um if there you'd accrue more benefit
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
than anyone else in the same position so
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
you have to balance all that in your
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
decision making sometimes that is enough
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
to help you decide sometimes it's not
 
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
and that's when people come to the
 
00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:52.700 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee and ask for us to to do
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
our advisory opinions
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.549 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
um

00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
I find interesting here is you know we
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
talk in the in the bill before us in
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
part C someone the legislative yeah it's
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
a rental uh someone the legislator cares
 
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.870 align:start position:0%
a rental uh someone the legislator cares
about

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
right but I find it very interesting on
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
page five under permitted activities the
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
first thing listed
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
is giving or receiving campaign
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
contributions it's amazing how fast a
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
legislature a legislator starts to care
 
01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:32.579 align:start position:0%
about something
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
when it comes to campaign contributions
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
and yet the first thing listed under
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
permitted activities
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
so if we're talking about the Public's
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
perception if that's what we're really
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
worried about here is is perception on
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
until that goes away
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
that's the Paramount issue is money in
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
politics so
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
and not only do we not even question if
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's prohibited or not we actually
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
listed as permitted
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
do I hear an amendment
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
is that what you're talking I'm going to
 
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
guarantee you right now that if I two
 
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
things will happen if I file amendment
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
campaign contributions out of this body
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm a dead man and secondly it will
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
never fly and it will never pass so
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a futile effort there I
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
mean if you really wanted to go down
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
that road the executive Council would
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
disappear right so I'm trying to deter
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
determine what you're saying what I'm
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
saying is I'm trying to figure out what
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
the intent here is because if if the
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
intent is to fix a public perception
 
01:01:35.339 --> 01:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
intent is to fix a public perception
problem

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
then that's the number one public
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
perception problem politicians have
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
and we're not touching that
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
so so maybe you're talking about a
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
separate bill that you that you want to
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that I'm I'm trying to wrap
 
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
my brain around
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
when we're reading all these things in
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
here that guide us that tell us what to
 
01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
do that give us Direction Why Don't We
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
Just leave it alone
 
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
I just don't you're not selling me on
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
the idea that we need to change this
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
that you know what I mean because we're
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know we're citing examples we're
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
showing procedure we're talking about
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
the book well this this is the current
 
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.370 align:start position:0%
the book well this this is the current
Playbook

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
Playbook
 
01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.589 align:start position:0%
Playbook
so

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we're concerned because there's a a
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
a large number of and accelerating
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
number of complaints sure tell which
 
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
tell us that there is
 
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:29.660 align:start position:0%
something that need we need to address
 
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
yeah but that may not be the we're also
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
being told by the chair of the committee
 
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.910 align:start position:0%
being told by the chair of the committee
that

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
that he needs or they need
 
01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
changes in order to handle the cases
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
that they currently have
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
I mean if they're getting an increased
 
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
amount of frivolous complaints then
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
that's I mean that's just what they've
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
just said frivolous
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
have these have these gone through the
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
process yet
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
all these complaints
 
01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
unless the participants are open to uh
 
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
disclosure but so also but also it's not
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking over past years you know
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at the and we had it at one
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
point the the number of complaints I
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
think that was handed out actually at
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
the at the freshman orientation the
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
number of complaints over the past
 
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
um three years or something like that it
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
is clearly
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
clearly what we have here
 
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.930 align:start position:0%
clearly what we have here
[Music]

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:40.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
isn't either at either educating the
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
representatives to what they
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
um can or should do or
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
um we're doing more things that are
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
either publicly perceived to be a
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
problem or not or we figured out a way
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
that hey we can kind of weaponize this
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to give you an example you
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
want to talk about issues and ethics I
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
was threatened with an Ethics complaint
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
if I advocated for something something
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
that has no financial interest on me in
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form okay so that's not
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
covered in this except it is in the
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
sense that when they if they're going to
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
file the ethics complaint it has to go
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
through the process now I would think it
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
would get tossed
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the initial process but they'd have
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
to talk to me first because I'm being
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
threatened because I'm advocating for
 
01:04:31.859 --> 01:04:32.690 align:start position:0%
threatened because I'm advocating for
something

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
that involves a board of directors I sit
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
on a board that owns no property has no
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
budget collects no tax money but because
 
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
I sit on that board they look at this
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
and say well you know your board member
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
says board member right
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
so this is the kind of crap that I think
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
is going to expand with this not not be
 
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.589 align:start position:0%
is going to expand with this not not be
reduced

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my concern with the
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
language as it sits right now and
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative nutting Wong's got an
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're we're apparently
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
avoiding at all costs right now to talk
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
about but
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why would you say that
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
oh I don't know we just keep going off
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
on tangents and she's asked to do that I
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
was that was half a joke but
 
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.510 align:start position:0%
was that was half a joke but
um

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
but uh my concern is that we've we make
 
01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
this less clear with the proposed
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
language changes instead of tightening
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
it up
 
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
and I you know I
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's how I see it right now and I'm
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my brain around doing you
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
know that going in the other direction
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
but I
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps for the explanation of her
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment would would help in that
 
01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.349 align:start position:0%
Amendment would would help in that
process

01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:44.990 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
um

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'll take your advice representative
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
nutting Wong do you have would you like
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment and what prompted it and
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
what part of I still see that special
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
interest is in here which was taken out
 
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.250 align:start position:0%
interest is in here which was taken out
of

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
that comes from the original language is
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
um so my Amendment says conflict of
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
interest means the condition in which a
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislator has a real or perceived
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
benefit Financial or otherwise for
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
themselves or another individual that
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
would not be properly available for
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
otherwise similarly situated individuals
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
and for the most part that's just
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
language I stole from Massachusetts
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
um because I thought that it was way
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
clearer than what we were trying to add
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I thought it was a good starting
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
point for another like for this
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
conversation rather than arguing about
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
someone the legislator cares about or
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
what an interest is
 
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.690 align:start position:0%
what an interest is
um

01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's other things we could
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh be discussing
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
um but I just liked it because I thought
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
it was clear that it made it
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
we didn't have all these weird
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
definitions and that was pretty much it
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
is she are you going to take any
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair if we can ask in
 
01:07:07.569 --> 01:07:07.579 align:start position:0%
reference to her we're in a work session
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
does this replace just so I understand
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
the the nuts and bolts of this does this
 
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.150 align:start position:0%
the the nuts and bolts of this does this
replace

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
replace
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
all of one so there's no a b and c
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
anymore this is this becomes Roman
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
numeral one in its entirety yeah yep so
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't deal with non-financial
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
personal interests or uh no that's part
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
anything anything
 
01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
kind of like it more simply because
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
um the part about it where it would
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
available for otherwise similarly
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
situated individuals for example if you
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
have a friend that owns a car repair
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
shop and you're voting on a bill that
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
helps car repair shops everyone that
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
owns a car repair shop
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
is helped out by that not just your
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
friends sort of thing I think that this
 
01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.450 align:start position:0%
friends sort of thing I think that this
is

01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit clearer in the sense that
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
you can have friends that benefit from
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
votes because it's not about your friend
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's about the state and as a in a hole
 
01:08:22.679 --> 01:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
it's about the state and as a in a hole
so

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for the amendment and I
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
don't want to be disrespectful but I
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
don't believe perceived benefit uh
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
perception is whatever your background
 
01:08:40.849 --> 01:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
is it's
 
01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:41.749 align:start position:0%
is it's
um

01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
not measurable
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that that would do
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
anything to decrease the number it might
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
even increase the number of complaints
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
if someone thinks there's
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
an Ethics violation there it might
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
Foster a complaint that wastes the
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee's time that's at least my
 
01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.110 align:start position:0%
committee's time that's at least my
initial

01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
initial
 
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
my initial thought on that maybe I'm
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
so I thought I came up with that but
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
turns out I stole that from the bill
 
01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:14.390 align:start position:0%
turns out I stole that from the bill
itself

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
so that would be an issue we'd have no
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
matter what but yeah but yeah it is kind
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
can I say something else um that I I
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about earlier
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
um as a representative I think we all
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature with passions
 
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.970 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature with passions
and

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.709 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
initiatives things that we want to fix
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
for our constituents and I have actually
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
said in some of the thank you notes that
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
I post to newspapers that when I vote
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
on bills I'm thinking about my
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
constituents they are part of my quote
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
family now and I don't want that to
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
change because we are as Representatives
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
we are the relationships that we have
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we're doing this job
 
01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.729 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we're doing this job
so

01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
I worry about making it
 
01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
so vague and open to interpretation
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
is uh yep go ahead I guess I'm getting a
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
little bit lost here because in the
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
beginning we were talking about what is
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
our perspective so bring me back into
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
what the perspective is is this for me
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
or is this for the perception outside
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
onto me because the way I read this is I
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
read this for me and I need to make a
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
decision if I'm going to disclose or
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
recuse myself and I'm not worried about
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
what someone's going to complain about
 
01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
me in this booklet or or is our should
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
our Focus be we're getting a lot of
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
outside complaints maybe they're
 
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
perceived maybe they're not whatever but
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's an outside influence on to the
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
legislators that we're trying to deal
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
with here what do we what do we because
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's I don't think you can split that
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
hair I think we have to make a decision
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
are we going that way or this way and
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
make that decision because I feel like
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're going like this on is this an
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
outside perception or is this for me as
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
a legislator
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
if you're asking me
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
if you're asking me it is it is to
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
advise you the legislator
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and to and to give get back to that
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
word guideline I think that's why or
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
code of conduct whichever you want to I
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
think this is to help you
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
know how to act
 
01:11:40.689 --> 01:11:40.699 align:start position:0%
and give you the ability with this
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
legislation to give you the ability
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
um to know how you can avoid or lessen
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
the possibility of of a complaint
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
um that's that's what I think this
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
change does is give you the tool
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
in the knowledge of how you can lessen
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
um complaints lodged again you'll never
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate the possibility that someone
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
will do it
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
but but I'd also like to say that
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
um I think we have fundamental questions
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
because I agree with you we're starting
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
with tentacles here in all different
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
directions I think we do need to
 
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:26.510 align:start position:0%
directions I think we do need to
somewhere

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.950 align:start position:0%
somewhere
say

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
how far from that legislator
 
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.630 align:start position:0%
how far from that legislator
um

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
we need to advise that the legislator
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
that he needs to worry about so as I
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
said there are states that just say this
 
01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
only relates to the legislator himself
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
there are others that say this goes from
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
the legislator to immediate family
 
01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:52.310 align:start position:0%
the legislator to immediate family
um

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we've ever even if we've
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
solved that issue first if we need to
 
01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.330 align:start position:0%
solved that issue first if we need to
know

01:12:59.330 --> 01:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
how far does the legislator when we're
 
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
advising him need to expand his thinking
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
about a conflict yep would be helpful to
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
look at what the law currently said
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
States on this which is on page 25 where
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
does

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
does the language
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
granted that some aren't happy with the
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
someone the legislator cares about
 
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.910 align:start position:0%
someone the legislator cares about
phrase

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
but does
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me
 
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
phrase includes all of the
 
01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.330 align:start position:0%
phrase includes all of the
um

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
all of the people that are mentioned in
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
this in the current booklet yes and and
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
expands it beyond that
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
um that's that's how I Envision it that
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
um not shrinking the pool of concern but
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
we're expanding the pool of concern by
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
saying something
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
um as some have characterized it as
 
01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.950 align:start position:0%
um as some have characterized it as
vague

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
vague
 
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.390 align:start position:0%
vague
um

01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
because it's too difficult to list every
 
01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:15.980 align:start position:0%
possibility and and household member
 
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
includes the someone the legislator
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
cares about
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
um that's a subset of that I think
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
well originally for many years it was
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
legislator and spouse
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then this was expanded to the
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
current definition about
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
15 years or so ago
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
and requires that the person live in the
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
same domicile
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
and share common economic interests in
 
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
the expenses of living in that domicile
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
do we Mr Lambert have
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
concerns or have we had cases where
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's not someone that lives in that
 
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.990 align:start position:0%
it's not someone that lives in that
household

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
household
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
for example they're you know if someone
 
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
says gee my brother lives doesn't live
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
in that household but this guy is voting
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
on a bill that benefits his brother
 
01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.390 align:start position:0%
on a bill that benefits his brother
um

01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
is that not an expansion that would be
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
fairly common I would think I mean I I
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't recall any complaint there's been
 
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
about 110 complaints since 1992. the
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee started
 
01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.649 align:start position:0%
committee started
yeah

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:27.659 --> 01:15:28.490 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
from my standpoint that would be
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
and the ones that I've heard anecdotally
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
in my community it's
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and maybe it happens more when we're
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
talking about Selectmen and and uh and
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
that level but
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
there are always situations where
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
someone says
 
01:15:48.719 --> 01:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
someone says
um

01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
you know sure he voted for that his
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
brother is a Timber owner and he's
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
voting for you know um and I'm getting
 
01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
nods around so it it does
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
um I have heard it so I'm surprised that
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
there aren't if you say that there
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
aren't uh
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
um complaints along that nature maybe
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
it's just grumbling and people move
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
along and figure there's nothing they
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
can do about it I don't know well you're
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
describing might invoke the prohibited
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
activity section but it depends on the
 
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
specifics you're right everything's the
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
devil's in the details right
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to make another point that
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire are citizen
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
legislature is 400 people we don't have
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
lawyers at our disposal we earn a
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year unlike the other
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
states that earn much more money and
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
have lawyers at their disposal I think
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
looking at other states doesn't
 
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily help us
 
01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:53.570 align:start position:0%
necessarily help us
just

01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.610 align:start position:0%
just
thought

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's possible that's true
 
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative turcott Do you have a
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
you've been strangely silent along this
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
whole way here
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
all right all right
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to run by anyone that has a
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
comment that uh
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
or yeah please hello
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
um I didn't mean to to scare you into it
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just new obviously I've been here
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
um so what I just wanted to comment that
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
I the book I honestly got this book at
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
orientation I skimmed it I didn't read
 
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
it thoroughly now I'm reading it
 
01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.970 align:start position:0%
it thoroughly now I'm reading it
thoroughly

01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
um but just what I thought was helpful
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
is in the back on starting on page 64.
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
they give examples about
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
what is a conflict when would you
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
disclose what what are your steps so
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps a suggestion could be to add
 
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
more whatever is hitting the Ethics
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
Committee now for violations perhaps
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
some of those examples could be
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
Illustrated as what a proper procedure
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
would be and you know kind of give more
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
examples I just find that examples are
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
really helpful to interpret what these
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
rules are all saying because the
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
language is heavy and especially if it's
 
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
lay people reading they might just see
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
something and be like they're violating
 
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
the law and get all up in arms but you
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
know if you have when you read these
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
examples in the back it kind of makes
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
things more makes a lot more sense to
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
everybody so I just think maybe EXT
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
expanding that
 
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
examples of how you interpret these
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
rules would be helpful yeah I uh I don't
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
disagree at all with that I I've always
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
done better with the
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
um what happened in what situation and
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
and how does it come close to my
 
01:18:38.219 --> 01:18:39.830 align:start position:0%
and how does it come close to my
situation

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
um and to point and to go along with
 
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
your agreement that someone may read
 
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
this and say oh you're violating my
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
um read on page one the under the
 
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
principles of Public Service
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
he was mean to me on Facebook
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna file a complaint
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's crazy
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but you can read that that way you
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
can say he uh treat the public with
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
dignity and respect um
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
he he called me a bad name on Facebook
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna file a complaint and and
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
make him miserable am I not accurate
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
that is what caused the increase in
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
complaints exactly
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
is the social media or number four or
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
both the social media and then people
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
looking at number four and filing a
 
01:19:43.739 --> 01:19:52.750 align:start position:0%
looking at number four and filing a
complaint

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly the
 
01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.930 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly the
problem

01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
that has come forward for the most part
 
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
is due to social media type complaints
 
01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
brought to the Ethics Committee Against
 
01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:09.530 align:start position:0%
brought to the Ethics Committee Against
members

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
just so I understand that yes and I have
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
some material for the
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
hearing on 157 this afternoon which
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
includes material I gave sent to
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
so I was going to talk to you about what
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
that one okay so so yes that
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not I don't think it's the
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
committee is concerned about their
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
workload what they're concerned about is
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
members of the public saying well this
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
legislator did such and such a thing
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
that clearly falls under number four and
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm filing a complaint and then the
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee says well this is just a
 
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.649 align:start position:0%
committee says well this is just a
aspirational

01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
aspirational
 
01:20:45.659 --> 01:20:47.110 align:start position:0%
aspirational
provision

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
and so we can't sustain a complaint on
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
violation of that and then the members
 
01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
of the public lose respect for the
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee and for the legislature
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's what Vice chairman scitec stated
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
during right one of the committee's um
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
discussions of this right can I follow
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
up with with my line with him sure okay
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
so if that's the problem if that's the
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
if that's the big concern that exists
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
right now how does House Bill 301 solve
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
that it's not the big problem not the
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
only problem okay but you just said that
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
was the that was the chunk of the issues
 
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
that we're not debating here we're just
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
saying it's not a matter of debate I'm
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
trying it is that
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
the tone is will you use this phrase
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm what we're saying is there are
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
01:21:34.739 --> 01:21:35.390 align:start position:0%
a number of
um

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh complaints that have come forth
 
01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
that's not the sole reason that there's
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
a spike in in complaints is number four
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's not the case what what he's
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
saying is he has they have received
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
these complaints and and people are
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
using this as
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines rather than aspirations
 
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.570 align:start position:0%
guidelines rather than aspirations
um

01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
we are pointing out that there is a
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
problem with number four but it is by no
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
means the soul problem it isn't what
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
prompted the chairman from from writing
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
the original bill that we had last
 
01:22:15.239 --> 01:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
the original bill that we had last
spring

01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
spring
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
no it does it doesn't matter because if
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
that if that's I'm just we're talking
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
about dealing with an increase in
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
complaints if if the overwhelming
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
majority of those increasing complaints
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
have to do with with part four this this
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
bill before us doesn't address that
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm trying to I don't
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
think House Bill 1368 or 301 Were Meant
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
to affect that right there's more than
 
01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
one problem this is what I mentioned is
 
01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
one problem but the other problem is
 
01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
when complaints arise such as the one
 
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
against the Senate President a few years
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
ago or involving
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
um former
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
Democratic member of the House who was
 
01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
involved employed by a union
 
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
I'm going to suggest
 
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
I'm going to suggest
um

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
as long as there's no complaints at a
 
01:23:17.699 --> 01:23:18.850 align:start position:0%
as long as there's no complaints at a
10-minute

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:18.860 align:start position:0%
10-minute
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
biological break
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
until uh until 10 30 or so does that
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you credit for that
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
one that's the first time I've heard it
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
described that way so uh you heard it
 
01:38:42.490 --> 01:38:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
um Everybody made it back right yep yep
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
oh no
 
01:38:49.739 --> 01:38:52.250 align:start position:0%
oh no
um representative

01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:53.570 align:start position:0%
um representative
excellent

01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
um try not to say anything noteworthy or
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
we have to explain back to her then
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be good
 
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.530 align:start position:0%
we'll be good
um

01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I don't know here's my plan and and
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm open to suggestions
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
um I I would like to hear the input from
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
so somewhere I'm I'm thinking we do this
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
for you know another 20 minutes or so
 
01:39:20.590 --> 01:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
maybe to 11 o'clock
 
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
and then recess the
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
um the work session to after
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee meets next Monday
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
at three yes
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and then and then we either take this
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
up we'll we'll talk about it
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
um individually
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
of when we can do this and and see if
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
we're any further along after we get
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
input from them
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
does that seem reasonable
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should take any action
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
of of amendments or anything
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding your Amendment
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
um I actually would like to suggest that
 
01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
um Janet bring your Amendment
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
to the Ethics Committee on Monday just
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
as a another piece that they can discuss
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
if anyone else has further things that
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
they would like to have Ethics Committee
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
amend or or look at I that would be all
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
right with you get make sure I get a
 
01:40:33.729 --> 01:40:33.739 align:start position:0%
copy and make sure
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative wall gets a copy that she
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
can bring to the Ethics Committee
 
01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.550 align:start position:0%
can bring to the Ethics Committee
um

01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
but again that you know you're not under
 
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
any obligation to do that I'm just
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
saying if there is something that you
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
want to at least say what do you think
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
um it would save time in the process of
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
trying to get to that point this is our
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
bill right
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
um we we're doing our due diligence to
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
try to get as much input as we can
 
01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
from whatever Source but
 
01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:06.770 align:start position:0%
from whatever Source but
um

01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh with that
 
01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.410 align:start position:0%
uh with that
um

01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
we kind of are are at this point of of
 
01:41:17.209 --> 01:41:17.219 align:start position:0%
almost breaking down the bill into
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
different areas that we have to decide
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
so we talked about a couple of them one
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
is one of which is
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of this
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and and I think it probably is a
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
little of both that we're talking about
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
either is it is it the guide that and
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
and as a preemptive book or is it a um
 
01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:39.260 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
rule book that will be judged against
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
should a complaint be filed in in the
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
01:41:46.679 --> 01:41:47.750 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
um

01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
I tend to look at it more as the as the
 
01:41:50.639 --> 01:41:51.590 align:start position:0%
I tend to look at it more as the as the
former

01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
former
 
01:41:54.010 --> 01:41:54.020 align:start position:0%
um that it is
 
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
the more we can help the the
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative make their own decisions
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good thing
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
um then we have to start getting into
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
those questions of how far it is from
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
the legislator that we need to worry
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
about or advise the legislator then we
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
need to get into
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
um what what types of issues
 
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's very odd in
 
01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:20.810 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's very odd in
here

01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm not sure how this is
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
dealt with but let's we've only ever
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
talked about one side of The Ledger
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
when you vote to benefit someone or
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
someone that's close to you or whatever
 
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
language you want to use what happens if
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
you're voting against can you can you
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
then vote is it okay to vote if you're
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to hurt somebody yeah I mean if
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
you're or if not
 
01:42:49.139 --> 01:42:49.850 align:start position:0%
you're or if not
um

01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
is it just a blanket you should not vote
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
when this is a when there is a conflict
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
or is it only
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't vote when
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's something that is actually
 
01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
benefiting someone
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
not voting against it you know if you've
 
01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
always had voted against I'll pick an
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
issue um Charter Schools let's say
 
01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
you've always voted against every
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
Charter School issue
 
01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:21.980 align:start position:0%
but now your your brother-in-law is
 
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
runs a charter school
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
is it only meaning that you shouldn't
 
01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
is it only meaning that you shouldn't
vote

01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.290 align:start position:0%
vote
um

01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
in favor of charter schools or can you
 
01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
still continue to vote against charter
 
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
schools that
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
better explained that's that's I don't
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
know I don't know the answer to that but
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
yeah kind of worms open yeah can of
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
worms well other states do have the
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
detriment in there and I don't know that
 
01:43:55.129 --> 01:43:55.139 align:start position:0%
it really I think the real Crux of it is
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
is benefit so if we had to focus on one
 
01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
thing I would keep it at as as a direct
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
or indirect benefit but other states in
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
that thing do have
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
um benefit or detriment so they they do
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
add it and so regardless of it can go
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
either way benefit or detriment and
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
really comes down to the influence and
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
what it has over your vote so if uh you
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
if you hated somebody and you did it
 
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
just to nudge them technically in some
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
states that would be for they they
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
should disclose and recuse uh what they
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
should yes we have that
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
on page 18 if you look at that
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the first paragraph on the sample
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
where is it page 18. yeah first
 
01:44:55.679 --> 01:44:56.689 align:start position:0%
where is it page 18. yeah first
paragraph

01:44:56.689 --> 01:44:56.699 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
third sentence
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:13.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:45:13.570 --> 01:45:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
so nothing am I correct in saying that
 
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that we're not changing any of
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
the forms with 301 so that would still
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
what about recusal would it be the same
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
it could
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
well I mean
 
01:45:36.659 --> 01:45:37.609 align:start position:0%
well I mean
um

01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
yes I would think so okay but maybe that
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
should be more specifically stated
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
somehow in the word right
 
01:45:45.719 --> 01:45:46.250 align:start position:0%
somehow in the word right
um

01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
said benefit well as it does here either
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial or detrimental that's all you
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
need to say right that recusal would be
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
an option
 
01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:02.330 align:start position:0%
an option
um

01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
there what was the other section that I
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
thought oh um
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's another piece in here that is
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
very important I think and I think
 
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
people should
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
think on this
 
01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:17.930 align:start position:0%
think on this
um

01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
to me it doesn't matter if anyone else
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
is getting this benefit
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
similarly situated as it is now in this
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
book to me if you are getting the
 
01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.629 align:start position:0%
book to me if you are getting the
benefit

01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
or or someone you care about is getting
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
that's all that matters it doesn't
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
matter if there's there's you know other
 
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
other financial advisors are getting the
 
01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
benefit it they're not voting on it you
 
01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
are is the way I look at it I don't know
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:55.930 align:start position:0%
if that's
um

01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:55.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's a good way to
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
think or not but that's how I think of
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
it yep
 
01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
problem with that is where do you cut it
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
off in other words
 
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
you own stock in a t i own stock in ATT
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
we vote on something that benefits them
 
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
I am far far far far far far far from a
 
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
major stockholder in at T
 
01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:19.189 align:start position:0%
major stockholder in at T
okay

01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
I'm getting no more benefit than anybody
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
else but if their stock goes up I'm
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
getting a benefit now do you put it at
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
you own two percent of the stock of the
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
company is it got to be 10 of the stock
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
of the company
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
you run into a problem because everybody
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
out here if you own a mutual fund odds
 
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
are you own stock in most companies
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
they're spread out all over the place
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
where do you draw the line
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
so yep do you want to go
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
we've thought about that you've talked
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
go ahead me gasping yeah
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
it brings to mind a situation where a t
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
was an issue before us right
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
there was a whole line at the clerk's
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
office to file and actually we were
 
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
going overboard it's a few benefit more
 
01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
than somebody else currently yeah yeah
 
01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:12.590 align:start position:0%
than somebody else currently yeah yeah
currently

01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.669 align:start position:0%
currently
um

01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
but none of those
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
and and maybe the way to handle it is
 
01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
the same way we've put in here for the
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
exclusions to recuse all that you know
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't apply to the budget because
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
virtually all of us have something in
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
the budget that that
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
affects us somehow you know and and
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
would be eliminated from having a quorum
 
01:48:38.290 --> 01:48:38.300 align:start position:0%
if everyone
 
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
excluded themselves from that there's
 
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
also an exclusion in here for General
 
01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:45.659 align:start position:0%
Revenue bills or bills of such great
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
interest where a large percentage of the
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
members would be affected as to cause a
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
problem with Quorum so
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
I kind of put it in that category maybe
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
there needs to be something different
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's obvious I can't see that anyone
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
said would come back and file a
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
complaint again if I'm looking at this
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
as an advisory thing for the legislator
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
I can't see anybody coming back and
 
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
saying I'm in I'm in danger of
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
of having an Ethics charge filed against
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
me because I own Vanguard you know
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
Capital Growth Fund um
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
it I understand your point but somewhere
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
along the line you can drag this thing
 
01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
out to it you can grow it out too far
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
right the lunacy this is a guide to each
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
individual and only a guide everybody in
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
this room should have an Ethics standard
 
01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
that they built up over their lives
 
01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay they should it may not be a good
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
one but they've got one of some way
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
shape or form this is just a guide to
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
give them okay maybe what I'm thinking
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
this thing says it's not the best idea
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay maybe I change maybe I don't
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
but you've got an Ethics background
 
01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.750 align:start position:0%
but you've got an Ethics background
already

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not for everyone else and if you
 
01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:11.219 align:start position:0%
think it's for everyone else
 
01:50:15.050 --> 01:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
then you really are a politician and if
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
you don't want to think your of yourself
 
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
that way then it's got to be for you
 
01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:25.010 align:start position:0%
that way then it's got to be for you
only

01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could have said that any
 
01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:27.490 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could have said that any
better

01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:27.500 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
but well I have a question then and and
 
01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:31.970 align:start position:0%
but well I have a question then and and
I

01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think we need to clarify this
 
01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.410 align:start position:0%
I think we need to clarify this
foreign

01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
the words in this book is this the
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
standard to which the Ethics Committee
 
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
makes a decision whether you've violated
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
the rules or not is this the standard
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
the ethics because if it is this is not
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
a guide
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
this is a standard well it's really both
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
um but anyone can file a complaint
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
against you if they feel that you
 
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
violated one of the provisions in the
 
01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.010 align:start position:0%
violated one of the provisions in the
booklet

01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
booklet
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
and there are other Provisions which are
 
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors if you violate them
 
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
which which is if the gift materially uh
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
well you must know yeah if you
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
materially uh re don't list every one of
 
01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.250 align:start position:0%
materially uh re don't list every one of
your

01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.109 align:start position:0%
your
um

01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
real or perceived benefits or
 
01:51:30.169 --> 01:51:30.179 align:start position:0%
if you leave off
 
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:32.900 align:start position:0%
knowingly leave off something off your
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
statements yes exactly that's where the
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors come and also violations of
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
14c which is the gift but I think the
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
bigger I to me the bigger part rather
 
01:51:47.209 --> 01:51:47.219 align:start position:0%
than the book I think the bigger part is
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
then that those steps that you mentioned
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
earlier the um the initial conversation
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
I forget the phraseology they used for
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
that initial review the initial review
 
01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.189 align:start position:0%
that initial review the initial review
um

01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:01.199 --> 01:52:03.169 align:start position:0%
um
that's

01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's a bigger piece of that
 
01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:08.699 align:start position:0%
determination of whether you are in
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
violation or not then this and then the
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
next step when you're actually brought
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
in if they if you pass that or don't
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
pass that initial review that's a bigger
 
01:52:21.169 --> 01:52:21.179 align:start position:0%
step than this
 
01:52:21.179 --> 01:52:21.709 align:start position:0%
step than this
um

01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's I I think we still come down
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
to that I don't know what the percentage
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
is to me
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
this is 80 percent guideline 20 percent
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
um whatever it is you want to call it
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the sentencing guidelines you
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
know I mean this is yeah that's a bad
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
phrase isn't it
 
01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:43.550 align:start position:0%
phrase isn't it
um

01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is um this is more aspirational and
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
and more but I
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
Beyond just the guideline it's also
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
the to me the ability
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
to to advise
 
01:53:05.689 --> 01:53:05.699 align:start position:0%
the legislator how to mitigate or lessen
 
01:53:05.699 --> 01:53:08.290 align:start position:0%
the legislator how to mitigate or lessen
that

01:53:08.290 --> 01:53:08.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
chance of a you can't eliminate but the
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
chance of a complaint being filed
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
against you
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
that's that was what 301 was is about
 
01:53:18.179 --> 01:53:19.669 align:start position:0%
that's that was what 301 was is about
yep

01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:53:19.679 --> 01:53:20.930 align:start position:0%
yep
question

01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:25.609 --> 01:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
anything you decide in the Ethics
 
01:53:27.719 --> 01:53:29.390 align:start position:0%
anything you decide in the Ethics
Committee

01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
is that final other than removal uh
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
thrown out of the house uh which has to
 
01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
go to the full body or does anything you
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
come up with have to go to the full body
 
01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
any sanctioned
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's recommended as a recommendation
 
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
by the committee to the body
 
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
now that can be informal resolutions
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
where the respondent agrees to
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
that he or she did something incorrect
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
and they'll take certain steps to make
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
sure that doesn't happen again
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
and that is what we had in the two
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
complaints I mentioned and that was
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
internal to the to the committee that
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
never went to the floor no it was
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
published in the calendars though yes it
 
01:54:15.169 --> 01:54:15.179 align:start position:0%
was public
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay so you act as
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
quasi judge
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
which means you follow this but like any
 
01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:26.090 align:start position:0%
which means you follow this but like any
judge

01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
your ethics background might say well
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
something in here might not be exactly
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
right and for how and if others agree
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
with you on the committee
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
put aside yes no or are you bound and
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
adhere to every single you know uh thing
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's in there the committee
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
will decide if a complaint is has Merit
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
or not
and

01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
at the end of the certain process at
 
01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
certain points they make a
 
01:55:06.129 --> 01:55:06.139 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the body
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
reprimand censure or expulsion
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
but the devil is in the details right I
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
mean right it's impossible for them to
 
01:55:17.689 --> 01:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
write it yeah and and and put all of the
 
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
relationships and all of the other
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
things that that could be affected
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
um somewhere along the line it does
 
01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.270 align:start position:0%
um somewhere along the line it does
become

01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
judges yeah and then how they interpret
 
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
it and interpret your
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
your circumstance your circumstance and
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
your explanation of the circumstances if
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
you wish to see those complaints which
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
were public or on the committee's
 
01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:46.669 align:start position:0%
were public or on the committee's
website

01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:55:48.890 --> 01:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
and you you can see those which have
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
gone to a special to a formal hearing
 
01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
have resulted in a special report which
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
are pretty lengthy and or pretty much
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
like a court decision
 
01:56:01.129 --> 01:56:01.139 align:start position:0%
and you can see how they go through each
 
01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
of the charges and what they find with
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
my concern has always been
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
and you spoke to it earlier that every
 
01:56:13.570 --> 01:56:13.580 align:start position:0%
all of us come with our own
 
01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
level of ethics and
 
01:56:19.129 --> 01:56:19.139 align:start position:0%
but somewhere there needs to be a
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
recognition that because we are A
 
01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.149 align:start position:0%
recognition that because we are A
legislature

01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
your ethics and your ethics and your
 
01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.669 align:start position:0%
your ethics and your ethics and your
ethics

01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
um affect my ethics or or My Reputation
 
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
or my anything
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's also part of this you know
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
we aren't operating in a vacuum and and
 
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.310 align:start position:0%
we aren't operating in a vacuum and and
so

01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.149 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
we get tired with that great big brush
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
along the way that's what you have to be
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
careful of well among everything yeah
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
yep yep so so if this is if we're
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
treating this as as a a guide for the
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee can we get a copy of
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
rules that they use to make their
 
01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
decisions if this pink purple book is
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
not that dot not that set of well rules
 
01:57:20.649 --> 01:57:20.659 align:start position:0%
the committee's rules are in the booklet
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
oh the committee's procedural rules are
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the booklet okay so they are so they
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
are then judging a member's complaint
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
based on what is in this book Yep
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
full disclosure one of mine is it mine
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
printed in here no it's on the website
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
though mine is on the website
 
01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:52.810 align:start position:0%
though mine is on the website
um

01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:52.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
it gets into that
 
01:57:57.169 --> 01:57:57.179 align:start position:0%
um what's the category what's the
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
phraseology the
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
um better to ask permission than
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
forgiveness or vice versa
 
01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.390 align:start position:0%
forgiveness or vice versa
um

01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
I always thought
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
especially with this kind of thing that
 
01:58:12.729 --> 01:58:12.739 align:start position:0%
you're better off
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
discussing it before it becomes an issue
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
um but I wasn't aware that the Ethics
 
01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
Committee would do that
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
oh sure so you can go to the Ethics
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
Committee and say I have a particular
 
01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
scenario that I'm concerned about and
 
01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
they will make a preliminary decision
 
01:58:31.129 --> 01:58:31.139 align:start position:0%
based on the circumstances you present
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
before them yes on page 27 I keep
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
telling you to go to different pages but
 
01:58:39.850 --> 01:58:39.860 align:start position:0%
page 27 RSA 14b3
 
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
paragraph ID I'm sorry C
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
talks about one of the committee's
 
01:58:51.410 --> 01:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
and that those get published in the
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
what there are their opinion on a
 
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
question gets published in the calendar
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
it's public yep so I'm I'm I would I'm
 
01:59:09.169 --> 01:59:09.179 align:start position:0%
guessing but I'm fairly certain that
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
you've been here and got a calendar that
 
01:59:13.609 --> 01:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
had one of those listed on the front
 
01:59:13.619 --> 01:59:15.589 align:start position:0%
had one of those listed on the front
page

01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:59:15.599 --> 01:59:17.330 align:start position:0%
page
yeah

01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the community can issue interpretive
 
01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
rulings on its own motion also if it
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
hears there's confusion and or something
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to be clarified and which is
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
what those two items are at the back of
 
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
the booklet those are interpretive
 
01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:36.050 align:start position:0%
the booklet those are interpretive
rulings

01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's in here it's just
 
01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.950 align:start position:0%
it's in here it's just
um

01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:50.109 --> 01:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't know many people uh that are
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
legislators and have been legislators
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
for years
 
01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
that are confident they know this book
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that has always well
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
you've been here how many terms now it
 
02:00:04.139 --> 02:00:05.290 align:start position:0%
you've been here how many terms now it
it

02:00:05.290 --> 02:00:05.300 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
right it is
 
02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
um always if you ask anyone when they
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
filled out the forms every year or every
 
02:00:17.570 --> 02:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
two years or whatever we're doing now
 
02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:18.169 align:start position:0%
two years or whatever we're doing now
um

02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
are you confident that well I filled it
 
02:00:24.169 --> 02:00:24.179 align:start position:0%
out the best way I know how
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
um but but no one has a level of
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
confidence that they are
 
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
doing everything the way that they're
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing it and that's not
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
right to me to me that's where this
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
guideline that's where this book needs
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
to be simpler with less definitions and
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
and more again aspirational here's what
 
02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:49.820 align:start position:0%
here's how we should be operating
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
individually because we do
 
02:00:56.209 --> 02:00:56.219 align:start position:0%
affect all all of us collectively
 
02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
it's a moving Target that's going to
 
02:01:04.609 --> 02:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
stay a moving carpet it's not going to
 
02:01:04.619 --> 02:01:05.810 align:start position:0%
stay a moving carpet it's not going to
change

02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:07.790 align:start position:0%
change
okay

02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:09.729 --> 02:01:09.739 align:start position:0%
when my father your father whatever
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
microphone thanks when my father your
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
father whatever were in the military
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
Way Way Back
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
you could tell a dirty joke
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
you can't now
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay somebody might be offended okay
 
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
somebody might be offended by something
 
02:01:33.129 --> 02:01:33.139 align:start position:0%
you tweet or put out on Facebook
 
02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
Roman four yeah but you can't do that
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
anymore somebody might be offended later
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
on because you were a tweed jacket
 
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay that might offend somebody
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
that may come out that may come out
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
later on that okay that's grounds for
 
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
this it's a moving Target that always
 
02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:55.669 align:start position:0%
this it's a moving Target that always
changes

02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
based on societal norms
 
02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
I think when this bill first came to us
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
was for whether or not we should decide
 
02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
should we recuse ourselves for somebody
 
02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
that is outside the family member
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
outside of your spouse or or somebody
 
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
that you care about that was that was
 
02:02:24.169 --> 02:02:24.179 align:start position:0%
the original language and we have an
 
02:02:25.729 --> 02:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
amendment with some different language
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's what I think we need to be
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
focused on here do you do we agree or
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
not agree that we should take that step
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
further to go beyond the household is
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
that if it is somebody outside of your
 
02:02:38.159 --> 02:02:39.290 align:start position:0%
that if it is somebody outside of your
family

02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
has influence over you
 
02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:43.139 align:start position:0%
is that it's something that we should
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
put in the ethical guidelines to say you
 
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
should disclose or recuse your vote I
 
02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
think that's what we need to figure out
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
here right I mean that's what the bills
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
is it's a recusal
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
or a a a disclosure
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
of somebody outside of our family and
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
are we okay with it is that what and and
 
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
if that is the case if the the general
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
feeling is that that's something that we
 
02:03:11.149 --> 02:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
should do then we can dial in on the on
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
the language on that is is yeah it's a
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
moving Target it's all that all of that
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
this whole there's a whole book it we
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
can be here for like three years going
 
02:03:20.689 --> 02:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
over this but do we want to take that
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
step beyond the family
 
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
um you know are we comfortable doing
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
that and then then it just becomes a
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
matter of it's our bill right it becomes
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
a matter of how we how we Define it we
 
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
can Define it any way we want to it's
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
our bill now right so we can amend it to
 
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
but it's that first step is
 
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
are we going to go there it's uh and you
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
know I mean personally I'm comfortable
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
taking that leap I think it is an
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
ethical violation of my best friend if I
 
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
if he he or she
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
um has a material interest and I'm
 
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
influenced by that decision I feel
 
02:03:57.649 --> 02:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
personally like that should be a
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
guideline in this book to say you at
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
minimum have to disclose and make it
 
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
easier to recuse your vote on that one
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
and and um because sometimes it's not
 
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
easy to recuse yourself especially if
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
votes are close right but we need to
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
make it clear that no this is something
 
02:04:17.689 --> 02:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
that we probably should step back from
 
02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
on this vote
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's the step we we need
 
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
um someone who takes the Constitution
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
very seriously
 
02:04:34.619 --> 02:04:35.810 align:start position:0%
very seriously
if

02:04:35.810 --> 02:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
a vote that someone perceives might
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
influence or might be influenced by
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
a best friend or someone in my family
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
um violates the Constitution or my
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional oath
 
02:04:55.070 --> 02:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
where does that leave me
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
do you see what I'm talking about no I
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
don't what if what if um
 
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
I am I use the Constitution as
 
02:05:07.129 --> 02:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
my descent my litmus test whether or not
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
to vote on a bill
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
if someone fills out a complaint that
 
02:05:15.649 --> 02:05:15.659 align:start position:0%
they think I violated my ethics or
 
02:05:15.659 --> 02:05:16.790 align:start position:0%
they think I violated my ethics or
ethics

02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
because of that vote where does that
 
02:05:21.530 --> 02:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
leave me
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
does that ever happen
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
you can't have two litmus tests do you
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
know what I mean yes well the committee
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
is always refrained from interpreting
 
02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:33.179 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that's for the courts
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
um so they would dismiss because I
 
02:05:37.739 --> 02:05:39.470 align:start position:0%
um so they would dismiss because I
probably

02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um unless there was some other
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
if they found there was some statutory
 
02:05:46.729 --> 02:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
or other provision that was violated
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
I think I've read
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
at least for the time that I've been
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
here since 2010 I think I've read all of
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
the all of the possible ones that I've
 
02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I haven't seen anything like that
 
02:06:02.810 --> 02:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
that violates yeah I haven't seen anyone
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
say I voted this way because of the
 
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
Constitution I don't it's I don't just I
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't know that I've ever even read the
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
word constitution in any of the
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
complaints that come there so if that
 
02:06:18.490 --> 02:06:18.500 align:start position:0%
helps you I don't know no not really
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
bless you I'm sorry
 
02:06:27.169 --> 02:06:27.179 align:start position:0%
um moving on I I getting back to rep
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
Constable's um
 
02:06:29.159 --> 02:06:31.070 align:start position:0%
Constable's um
suggestion

02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
I think you're right I think there's
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's that is a key question how far
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
from that legislator do we go
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
um do we go past this idea of household
 
02:06:43.679 --> 02:06:45.350 align:start position:0%
um do we go past this idea of household
member

02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
member
 
02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
um and the definition that includes
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
financial interest similar Financial
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
interests within the
 
02:06:55.250 --> 02:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know how
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
how far beyond that and that is one of
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
the fundamentals but there's about four
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
fundamental questions that we have to
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
add just a couple of words someone with
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
might be the might be the winning phrase
 
02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
um but again it's still we still have to
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
answer his question which is how far
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
beyond the family do we go
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's entirely possible that you're very
 
02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
very close to someone beyond your
 
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
immediate family I mean it happens all
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
the time right and so it's entirely
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
possible you're involved with someone
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
who who's a financial advisor or
 
02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.689 align:start position:0%
who who's a financial advisor or
something

02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
comments we went past my 11 o'clock semi
 
02:07:49.129 --> 02:07:49.139 align:start position:0%
deadline but um if
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
are we at a good place to stop and
 
02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
wander off and think about and read
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
maybe more carefully the the 68 pages we
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
have and then
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
um what does everyone think about the
 
02:08:05.169 --> 02:08:05.179 align:start position:0%
idea that we come back after ethics
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
meets and talks and maybe has
 
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
suggestions for us there may be in
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
addition to uh representative nutting
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
Wong's Amendment there may be
 
02:08:18.649 --> 02:08:18.659 align:start position:0%
others from them but there may be some
 
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
from us as well so all I'm asking is
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
that I'd be made aware
 
02:08:28.609 --> 02:08:28.619 align:start position:0%
and also probably representative wall be
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
aware if anyone's working on an
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
amendment and and you know
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
if nothing else we can act as a
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
coordinator if there's two people that
 
02:08:39.649 --> 02:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
are acting on the same kind of an
 
02:08:42.770 --> 02:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
amendment we will would be happy to link
 
02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
you two up and so that there's something
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
similar but um
 
02:08:49.490 --> 02:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you feel I feel like
 
02:08:51.229 --> 02:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
we're at least having the conversation
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a good thing
 
02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:54.290 align:start position:0%
and that's a good thing
um

02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:58.070 --> 02:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
we will become somewhat of a resource to
 
02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
our fellow legislators
 
02:09:03.530 --> 02:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
in this fashion because
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
I would almost guarantee you that we
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
know more about this issue after these
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
three hours than or two hours than
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else sitting in reps Hall on
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
February 14th
 
02:09:15.540 --> 02:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
February 14th
um

02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.290 align:start position:0%
um
well

02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
just because rich is there we're gonna
 
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
all know more but that's a whole other
 
02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:22.970 align:start position:0%
all know more but that's a whole other
story

02:09:22.970 --> 02:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
story
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
it it is an important topic it's
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most important
 
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
topics that this committee is has taken
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
up in the last uh
 
02:09:36.169 --> 02:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
three or four terms yeah
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
um so I I appreciate you
 
02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%

anytime offline
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
with that um I'll close the work session
 
02:09:51.010 --> 02:09:51.020 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:53.820 align:start position:0%

um our hearings start at
one

02:09:58.810 --> 02:09:58.820 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:10:01.490 --> 02:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
make a nice long lunch I guess
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
um if there's anything uh anyone needs
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna be hanging around here for a
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
little while
 
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
but we should be in we have three bills
 
02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:12.350 align:start position:0%
but we should be in we have three bills
on

02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:16.619 --> 02:10:17.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't know about you but I'm
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
looking forward to all three of them and
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
then we'll um hopefully we'll be done
 
02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
with all of our bills
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
with the exception of
 
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
a work session and I haven't scheduled
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
purposely an exec session
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
we have until March 15th to get all of
 
02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
our bills out
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
I think if everyone agrees I think we
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
can probably get
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
all of our bills done with one day
 
02:10:52.609 --> 02:10:52.619 align:start position:0%
one vote one day
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
seems fair right seven uh
 
02:10:59.689 --> 02:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
and uh and we obviously we always have
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
the choice if we want to retain
 
02:11:03.649 --> 02:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
something but I'd prefer not to
 
02:11:03.659 --> 02:11:05.109 align:start position:0%
something but I'd prefer not to
um

02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
that's all I know at this point so I
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
haven't scheduled anything you haven't
 
02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
missed anything if if you're thinking
 
02:11:12.169 --> 02:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
that when are we going to do this and
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
everyone else is exacting and we aren't
 
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
don't worry
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
um we're under control all right thanks
 
02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:32.640 --> 04:01:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.000 --> 04:01:12.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:01:12.490 --> 04:01:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
if I can interrupt for a minute
 
04:01:17.929 --> 04:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
um there's going to be a quick uh five
 
04:01:20.330 --> 04:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
or ten minute caucus by the Republicans
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the Democrats Republicans will stay
 
04:01:25.610 --> 04:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
here Democrats will use the office
 
04:07:01.729 --> 04:07:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
so the time being uh four minutes past
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
one I'll open the hearing on House Bill
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
134 and welcome not the prime sponsor
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
but someone speaking to it right uh
 
04:07:16.729 --> 04:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Edgar
 
04:07:20.210 --> 04:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh has asked for two minutes
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative Administration
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:29.210 --> 04:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
as you said my name is Mike Edgar I
 
04:07:30.650 --> 04:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
represent Hampton
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
I found out by uh thank you Mr Mr
 
04:07:37.010 --> 04:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
chairman and the committee members you
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
know for allowing me to introduce hb134
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
to you today
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
the bill establishes the legislature as
 
04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
a public employer under the public
 
04:07:48.410 --> 04:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
employee Labor Relations Act and
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
establishes procedures for collective
 
04:07:54.110 --> 04:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
bargaining by non-partisan employees
 
04:07:56.210 --> 04:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
the legislature will join the judicial
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
branch and other state agencies which
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
already have a place a program as public
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
employees under the public employee
 
04:08:06.429 --> 04:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
relations act
 
04:08:09.650 --> 04:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
this Arrangement has been worked well in
 
04:08:12.530 --> 04:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
other government entities employees are
 
04:08:14.090 --> 04:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
given a choice as to whether or not to
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
form a union
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
existing job action and strike laws
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
would apply
 
04:08:20.689 --> 04:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
instead of me going through the the
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
history here I have written for you I'll
 
04:08:23.689 --> 04:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
just basically say that there's been a
 
04:08:25.550 --> 04:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
lot of activity on this you know from
 
04:08:29.809 --> 04:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
um the interesting part is that one year
 
04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
it passed in the Senate and not in the
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
house another year passing the house not
 
04:08:38.150 --> 04:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
04:08:38.160 --> 04:08:38.929 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
um

04:08:38.929 --> 04:08:38.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:38.939 --> 04:08:40.269 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:08:40.269 --> 04:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:43.250 --> 04:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
non-partisan employee means an employee
 
04:08:44.689 --> 04:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
whose purpose is to serve the
 
04:08:47.090 --> 04:08:47.100 align:start position:0%

04:09:58.250 --> 04:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
I want representative Conley
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
being here as well and thanks for taking
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm guessing I just need
 
04:10:07.610 --> 04:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
clarification on this that this is
 
04:10:08.929 --> 04:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
obviously different with public
 
04:10:10.969 --> 04:10:10.979 align:start position:0%
employees than say for example private
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
employees they specifically need our
 
04:10:16.929 --> 04:10:16.939 align:start position:0%
permission in order to join a union
 
04:10:20.150 --> 04:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
whereas in private practice they have
 
04:10:22.370 --> 04:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
the right to form a union is that
 
04:10:24.650 --> 04:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
correct uh that's my understanding yes
 
04:10:26.450 --> 04:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you no further questions
 
04:10:27.769 --> 04:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%

neither in favor nor opposed to the
 
04:11:25.550 --> 04:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislation just presenting you some
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
informational uh points
 
04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to just go over briefly some
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
of the numbers uh Mr chairman you asked
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
the question about total staff for the
 
04:11:38.450 --> 04:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
general court there are over 100 General
 
04:11:41.570 --> 04:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
Court staffers total and that does
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
include both the house the Senate and
 
04:11:46.490 --> 04:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
Joint however I do want to bring up a
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
couple of points specific to the house
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
because this is obviously where we are
 
04:11:54.170 --> 04:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
at this point there are 24 full-time
 
04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
house employees pursuant to this bill
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
six of those are politically exempt
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
meaning three work in the Republican
 
04:12:04.490 --> 04:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
Office three work in the Democratic
 
04:12:07.370 --> 04:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
office uh according to past labor
 
04:12:07.380 --> 04:12:08.410 align:start position:0%
office uh according to past labor
practices

04:12:08.410 --> 04:12:08.420 align:start position:0%
practices
 
04:12:11.150 --> 04:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
supervisors are usually exempt from
 
04:12:13.729 --> 04:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
these types of of bargaining units as
 
04:12:16.610 --> 04:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
well and that would affect at least an
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
additional six the chief of staff and
 
04:12:20.929 --> 04:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Chief of Staff the clerk and
 
04:12:22.729 --> 04:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
the assistant clerk the commission
 
04:12:24.650 --> 04:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me the director of committee
 
04:12:26.090 --> 04:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
services and the deputy director of
 
04:12:27.889 --> 04:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
committee services so that brings us
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
down to 12 house employees that this
 
04:12:34.090 --> 04:12:34.100 align:start position:0%
legislation would potentially impact
 
04:12:38.090 --> 04:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to know that
 
04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm in my 18th year on staff here in the
 
04:12:43.070 --> 04:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
general court staff has never been
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
surveyed on this issue staff has never
 
04:12:48.410 --> 04:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
been approached those that are within
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
these bounds so to speak have never been
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
asked if if we desire to be a member of
 
04:12:57.050 --> 04:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
any collective bargaining unit
 
04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
I would I would also note that the
 
04:13:03.650 --> 04:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
unique nature of the legislature is that
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker does rely on institutional
 
04:13:10.130 --> 04:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
Knowledge from most people here most
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
people in the legislature uh in terms of
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
the staff spend their careers here most
 
04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
of them start when they're in their 20s
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
and will often leave when they're in
 
04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
their 60s so the the turnover rate here
 
04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the legislature is not high that
 
04:13:28.370 --> 04:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
being said this is a political
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
institution this is unlike an executive
 
04:13:33.769 --> 04:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
branch or judicial branch because the
 
04:13:35.929 --> 04:13:35.939 align:start position:0%
judicial branch obviously the the
 
04:13:38.809 --> 04:13:38.819 align:start position:0%
persons that run the judicial branch are
 
04:13:41.929 --> 04:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
all there for a very long time as well
 
04:13:43.610 --> 04:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
on their own rights in terms of the
 
04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
leadership because they are appointed
 
04:13:48.250 --> 04:13:48.260 align:start position:0%
until they're in 70 years old
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
the nature of the executive branch is
 
04:13:53.450 --> 04:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
even though the chief executive does
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
change over every two years the ship of
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
state government does not not stop every
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
two years regardless of of who the
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
captain of that ship is uh and so the
 
04:14:06.290 --> 04:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
the the nature of government is that
 
04:14:08.750 --> 04:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
government continues uh the legislative
 
04:14:08.760 --> 04:14:09.889 align:start position:0%
government continues uh the legislative
branch

04:14:09.889 --> 04:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
branch
 
04:14:09.899 --> 04:14:10.490 align:start position:0%
branch
um

04:14:10.490 --> 04:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:13.969 --> 04:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
we change over every two years uh you
 
04:14:16.969 --> 04:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
you know in this body alone we we
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
typically have about a third the change
 
04:14:20.929 --> 04:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
is over every two years this year we
 
04:14:22.610 --> 04:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
were a bit above that we were close to
 
04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
160 new and returning members uh and
 
04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
that has definitely affected
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps the makeup of the chamber
 
04:14:35.050 --> 04:14:35.060 align:start position:0%
and having the speaker have the ability
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
to have those persons that the speaker
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
historically relies on usually the the
 
04:14:43.250 --> 04:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan staff stay in their
 
04:14:46.849 --> 04:14:46.859 align:start position:0%
positions is inherent in the trust in
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
the system uh that being said
 
04:14:54.290 --> 04:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
there are times when we do get actors in
 
04:14:56.570 --> 04:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
this uh in this branch of government
 
04:15:00.650 --> 04:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
that do Advance beyond their uh their
 
04:15:04.130 --> 04:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
their political so to speak involvement
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the speaker has historically and and
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
the mind of many should have that
 
04:15:11.929 --> 04:15:11.939 align:start position:0%
ability to surround him or herself with
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
the people that are here to advance the
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
institution and I would just note that
 
04:15:18.410 --> 04:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts our very labor-friendly
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
State uh to the South uh this past year
 
04:15:22.729 --> 04:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
an attempt was made in the Massachusetts
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
Senate to unionize and the Senate
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
leadership the Senate President and the
 
04:15:31.610 --> 04:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
chair of the Ways and Means Committee
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
basically said given the unique nature
 
04:15:36.769 --> 04:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
of their legislature that it did not
 
04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
make sense uh for them at that time
 
04:15:43.250 --> 04:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
and again I go back to those to those 12
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
people in the house that could
 
04:15:48.050 --> 04:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
potentially organize I'm aware of at
 
04:15:51.769 --> 04:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
least four state employee uh unions that
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
represent all of the state employees
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
across different different bodies and
 
04:15:58.610 --> 04:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
you could potentially have 12 people
 
04:16:00.889 --> 04:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
represented by four different collective
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
bargaining units which might make things
 
04:16:05.090 --> 04:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
a little bit difficult for our house
 
04:16:09.070 --> 04:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
legislative facility subcommittee so
 
04:16:11.689 --> 04:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions happy to answer
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
04:16:17.889 --> 04:16:17.899 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:16:17.899 --> 04:16:19.429 align:start position:0%
yes representative
McCarter

04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
McCarter
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair has there
 
04:16:24.110 --> 04:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
been any research done with regards to
 
04:16:26.689 --> 04:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impacts of
 
04:16:26.699 --> 04:16:27.469 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impacts of
um

04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
getting into this kind of an arrangement
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh there is there isn't a there is a
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the back here
 
04:16:36.830 --> 04:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
um we we have had this this is not the
 
04:16:39.290 --> 04:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
first uh time we have seen this bill uh
 
04:16:41.809 --> 04:16:41.819 align:start position:0%
obviously there there would be uh costs
 
04:16:41.819 --> 04:16:43.189 align:start position:0%
obviously there there would be uh costs
associated

04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
associated
 
04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of in uh certifying votes
 
04:16:49.130 --> 04:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
Etc so those are costs those are not
 
04:16:51.410 --> 04:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
borne out in this in this fiscal note
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
being none thank you very much

this bill was a request of the staff of
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative committee on
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
legislative facilities to
 
04:32:49.370 --> 04:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
clarify the statute and align it more
 
04:32:51.889 --> 04:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
with current practice
 
04:32:51.899 --> 04:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
with current practice
and

04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%

04:32:58.429 --> 04:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
questions that can be answered from my
 
04:33:01.250 --> 04:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
knowledge I'll be I'll try but I've also
 
04:33:04.970 --> 04:33:04.980 align:start position:0%

04:33:09.299 --> 04:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
will be able to answer many more than I
would

04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%

minimal questions you'll consent I'll
try

04:33:20.510 --> 04:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
try
 
04:33:22.250 --> 04:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
um do we have
 
04:33:25.730 --> 04:33:25.740 align:start position:0%

04:33:28.490 --> 04:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
none sorry
 
04:33:28.500 --> 04:33:29.990 align:start position:0%
none sorry
representative

04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
tyranny thank you for taking my question
 
04:33:36.890 --> 04:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
um when you say current practices
 
04:33:38.929 --> 04:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
whose current practices
 
04:33:41.330 --> 04:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
or what current practices that's one of
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we needed to have a
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill because the if you read the statute
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
it says that the Senate and the House of
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
Representatives shall proposed by a rule
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
this which in this session was not done
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
in the house I am not sure whether or
 
04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
not it was done in the Senate but I tend
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
to doubt it
 
04:34:07.490 --> 04:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
because the
 
04:34:07.500 --> 04:34:10.789 align:start position:0%
because the
um

04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.650 --> 04:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that the joint
 
04:34:14.929 --> 04:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
legislative facility committee has the
 
04:34:18.170 --> 04:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
authority to order the house to adopt a
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
specific rule in fact I would say
 
04:34:23.570 --> 04:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
offhand they don't have that Authority
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
well look Mr chairman
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
okay basically from what I can see on
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
this one
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
real change to it
 
04:34:37.490 --> 04:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
is where it drops the prior to the
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
beginning of each biennium the committee
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
shall determine whether it's proposed to
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate and House of Representatives
 
04:34:45.289 --> 04:34:45.299 align:start position:0%
that each body show proposed by rule
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
that all legislators legislative
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
officers and legislative staff shall
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
attend in person
 
04:34:53.689 --> 04:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
that seems to be all that's gone
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
um yes I believe that is the case and
 
04:34:59.810 --> 04:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
um I know I got an email I'm gonna
 
04:35:02.570 --> 04:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
presume the rest of the folks did here
 
04:35:05.949 --> 04:35:05.959 align:start position:0%
from an individual with the last name of
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
Anastasia or Anastasia however they
 
04:35:12.410 --> 04:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
pronounce it asking to vote against this
 
04:35:15.650 --> 04:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
simply because it takes the teeth out of
 
04:35:15.660 --> 04:35:16.369 align:start position:0%
simply because it takes the teeth out of
it

04:35:16.369 --> 04:35:16.379 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:35:19.551 --> 04:35:19.561 align:start position:0%
making it mandatory for everyone to
 
04:35:24.170 --> 04:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
attend uh training in person
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
yes that's true there there I like to
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
mention two things that you need to
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.170 --> 04:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
it says each body shall propose by rule
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
the house or Senate can take this
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
proposed Rule and turn it down there's
 
04:35:48.410 --> 04:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
nothing in the current statute that says
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
04:35:52.490 --> 04:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's one point
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the other is that like I said the
 
04:35:57.000 --> 04:35:57.650 align:start position:0%
and the other is that like I said the
[Music]

04:35:57.650 --> 04:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:35:57.660 --> 04:36:01.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.131 --> 04:36:04.141 align:start position:0%
the committee does not have the
 
04:36:07.131 --> 04:36:07.141 align:start position:0%
authority to tell the whole house what
 
04:36:08.990 --> 04:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
it can or cannot do
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
that's a widely known legal practice
 
04:36:14.929 --> 04:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
that a committee cannot cannot act for
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
04:36:16.439 --> 04:36:17.269 align:start position:0%
the whole
um

04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we don't want to have
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
it in our statute something that is
 
04:36:25.730 --> 04:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court has been has
 
04:36:29.929 --> 04:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:36:35.929 --> 04:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
I have one
 
04:36:37.490 --> 04:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
um short one
 
04:36:37.500 --> 04:36:38.330 align:start position:0%
um short one
um

04:36:38.330 --> 04:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:41.689 --> 04:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
we've also crossed out on here the uh
 
04:36:44.631 --> 04:36:44.641 align:start position:0%
that the policy shall be
 
04:36:44.641 --> 04:36:45.410 align:start position:0%
that the policy shall be
um

04:36:45.410 --> 04:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:45.420 --> 04:36:47.869 align:start position:0%
um
posted

04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
posted
 
04:36:50.051 --> 04:36:50.061 align:start position:0%
in the booklet
 
04:36:52.449 --> 04:36:52.459 align:start position:0%
is that because
 
04:36:55.849 --> 04:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee that produces the
 
04:36:59.349 --> 04:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
booklet is not responsible for
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
any rules that have been except for
 
04:37:05.330 --> 04:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
those that have been passed by the Full
 
04:37:07.490 --> 04:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
House and this was only passed by the
 
04:37:10.490 --> 04:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
joint facilities committee uh I'm afraid
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
I don't know why it is not in the book
 
04:37:12.959 --> 04:37:15.289 align:start position:0%
I don't know why it is not in the book
okay

04:37:15.289 --> 04:37:15.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:16.609 --> 04:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:19.609 --> 04:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
um any other comments questions not
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none I think maybe my question
 
04:37:25.250 --> 04:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
would be best for Mr Lambert uh thank
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
I have a second pink card
 
04:37:35.090 --> 04:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
um for Rich Lambert could you
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.051 --> 04:37:42.061 align:start position:0%
you indicate that you're neutral I'm not
 
04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
for or against the bill you're here to
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
provide information as a staff person I
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
can't advocate for policy
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
and right now actually I can't I don't
 
04:37:53.570 --> 04:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
have a specific new message from the
 
04:37:55.010 --> 04:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee because next Monday
 
04:37:57.410 --> 04:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
they will be discussing this and the
 
04:37:58.849 --> 04:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
recusal bill
 
04:38:01.010 --> 04:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
but I did discuss this with chairman Ned
 
04:38:03.650 --> 04:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
Gordon and he said
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
one thing that if the committee feels
 
04:38:08.631 --> 04:38:08.641 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:38:10.010 --> 04:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee should have
 
04:38:12.890 --> 04:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over this policy which
 
04:38:15.890 --> 04:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
begins on page 51 of our booklet
 
04:38:18.109 --> 04:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
then it should stay in the booklet
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
but the question is
 
04:38:22.670 --> 04:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee have a jurisdiction
 
04:38:26.631 --> 04:38:26.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
so they're looking for clarity
 
04:38:29.160 --> 04:38:30.590 align:start position:0%
so they're looking for clarity
uh

04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Lambert
 
04:38:35.209 --> 04:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
um you'll take a question or two if we
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
have them
 
04:38:38.631 --> 04:38:38.641 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
from the committee I have one I noticed
 
04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
on that page that you mentioned
 
04:38:48.769 --> 04:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
at least when I found it before
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's part um
 
04:38:54.051 --> 04:38:54.061 align:start position:0%
part five right yes
 
04:38:54.061 --> 04:38:54.949 align:start position:0%
part five right yes
um

04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:58.730 --> 04:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
that at one time it used to say
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
as approved approved it actually says on
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
page 57.
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
um approved January 5th 2016 by The
 
04:39:10.849 --> 04:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative facilities committee
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
04:39:16.369 --> 04:39:16.379 align:start position:0%
to us or should that mean to us that
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
this was never voted on by the Full
 
04:39:18.840 --> 04:39:19.849 align:start position:0%
this was never voted on by the Full
House

04:39:19.849 --> 04:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
House
 
04:39:22.849 --> 04:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
it was adopted only by the facilities
 
04:39:25.970 --> 04:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
committee and therefore it's your belief
 
04:39:25.980 --> 04:39:27.349 align:start position:0%
committee and therefore it's your belief
that

04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
or or the belief of the Ethics Committee
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
that this does not
 
04:39:35.090 --> 04:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh fall within their duties
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think they've reached that
 
04:39:38.630 --> 04:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
conclusion they would like to know they
 
04:39:41.810 --> 04:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
want some clarity and I prepared this a
 
04:39:45.770 --> 04:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
handout so this policy includes both
 
04:39:47.570 --> 04:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment but it's much broader
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
it includes other types of harassment
 
04:39:51.770 --> 04:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
and other issues discrimination and such
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
and several complaints have been founded
 
04:39:57.110 --> 04:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
on by alleged violation of that
 
04:39:58.850 --> 04:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
and so the committee has tried to work
 
04:40:02.630 --> 04:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
its way through this but
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is a policy it's not a rule and
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a law
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
and in the handout I provided
 
04:40:13.368 --> 04:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
it shows that yes sexual harassment is
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
established by law something that the
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee can take jurisdiction
 
04:40:19.010 --> 04:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
over if someone files a complaint
 
04:40:21.650 --> 04:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
but then on the next page we see that
 
04:40:24.890 --> 04:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
the definition of rule is that has been
 
04:40:24.900 --> 04:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
the definition of rule is that has been
Limited

04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
Limited
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
and this isn't even a rise to the level
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
of being a rule it's a policy from
 
04:40:30.120 --> 04:40:32.690 align:start position:0%
of being a rule it's a policy from
facilities

04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:40:32.700 --> 04:40:35.390 align:start position:0%
facilities
and

04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
the supporting information here about
 
04:40:38.630 --> 04:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative history a little bit
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
very short about um when that change to
 
04:40:43.690 --> 04:40:43.700 align:start position:0%
the committee's jurisdiction occurred
 
04:40:47.530 --> 04:40:47.540 align:start position:0%
and the committee report
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
saying that it clarif it seeks to
 
04:40:53.330 --> 04:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
clarify the committee's jurisdiction in
 
04:40:57.530 --> 04:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
terms of rules so page three
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
and then I included minutes from a
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee's meeting where it discussed
 
04:41:04.250 --> 04:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
all of this with the speaker and
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
04:41:09.010 --> 04:41:09.020 align:start position:0%
and so the committee would like to know
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
clearly if this is something that is
 
04:41:12.590 --> 04:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
intended for the committee type
 
04:41:15.170 --> 04:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over
 
04:41:16.368 --> 04:41:16.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
how did the committee handle complaints
 
04:41:27.470 --> 04:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
that came to it
 
04:41:32.448 --> 04:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
it I'm trying to think of it there was
 
04:41:37.850 --> 04:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
one complaint that went public and that
 
04:41:39.288 --> 04:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
was a complaint against Representatives
 
04:41:39.298 --> 04:41:40.368 align:start position:0%
was a complaint against Representatives
palane

04:41:40.368 --> 04:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
palane
 
04:41:40.378 --> 04:41:41.690 align:start position:0%
palane
and

04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:43.850 --> 04:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
part of that was
 
04:41:43.860 --> 04:41:44.570 align:start position:0%
part of that was
um

04:41:44.570 --> 04:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
they did
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
use language in the policy and coming to
 
04:41:53.570 --> 04:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
because I mean there's a broader
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
section two of the statute which says
 
04:41:59.868 --> 04:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
you know the committee should have the
 
04:42:02.090 --> 04:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over manners which reflect
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
negatively on the legislature so that's
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
so the committee though is asking for
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
clarification more than anything else
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
and and does this house bill 157 provide
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
the clarification that you're looking
 
04:42:22.250 --> 04:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
for no
 
04:42:25.850 --> 04:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
does that mean that we would need
 
04:42:28.368 --> 04:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
to amend I I guess I answered my own
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
question we would need to amend this in
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
order to provide Clarity for the Ethics
 
04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
Committee to handle complaints of this
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
nature yes they can handle the sexual
 
04:42:39.530 --> 04:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
harassment complaints it's one of the
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
two avenues that
 
04:42:43.250 --> 04:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
um an alleged victim could take or they
 
04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
could take the other Avenue of
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
the accounting office and the the
 
04:42:52.250 --> 04:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
person designated to handle those the
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
independent Human Resources professional
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
or you can file a complaint with the
 
04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
committee so that they know about that
 
04:43:00.910 --> 04:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
that's clear but these other types of
 
04:43:04.128 --> 04:43:04.138 align:start position:0%
discrimination or use of hate speech and
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
so forth which are mentioned in the
 
04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
policy they're not certain that they
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
have and I think
 
04:43:14.930 --> 04:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
they would like a decision made or maybe
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
this could be more explicit more
 
04:43:17.580 --> 04:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
this could be more explicit more
specific

04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:43:21.288 --> 04:43:21.298 align:start position:0%
does the um
 
04:43:23.690 --> 04:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
does the committee I don't even know if
 
04:43:25.368 --> 04:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
it has an official name but this
 
04:43:28.850 --> 04:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
specific committee that the the speaker
 
04:43:30.288 --> 04:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
um I always call it the speakers
 
04:43:32.810 --> 04:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
committee but I have no idea what its
 
04:43:35.530 --> 04:43:35.540 align:start position:0%
official term is speakers Advisory Group
 
04:43:38.930 --> 04:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
does that enter into this as well and
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
are they looking also for guidance on
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
how to that I don't know about maybe
 
04:43:43.320 --> 04:43:44.208 align:start position:0%
how to that I don't know about maybe
okay

04:43:44.208 --> 04:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'll do things get do things get
 
04:43:49.128 --> 04:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
referred to them from the Ethics
 
04:43:49.138 --> 04:43:50.628 align:start position:0%
referred to them from the Ethics
Committee

04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
04:43:52.610 --> 04:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
they could I don't think they did that
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
yet things have been referred to the
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee from sag okay but the
 
04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee hasn't done the
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
opposite going the other way so we would
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
have to decide as a committee which
 
04:44:07.010 --> 04:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
Avenue would be best or or which group
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
would be best to handle those types of
 
04:44:12.410 --> 04:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
complaints yes
 
04:44:12.420 --> 04:44:14.690 align:start position:0%
complaints yes
um

04:44:14.690 --> 04:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
does this sound like something I'm
 
04:44:19.250 --> 04:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
saying to the committee does this sound
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
like something we need a work session on
 
04:44:26.090 --> 04:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
to or a subcommittee uh to deal with
 
04:44:30.050 --> 04:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
um especially if we are asking the
 
04:44:33.470 --> 04:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee and they they would
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
well I should almost ask representative
 
04:44:36.000 --> 04:44:36.948 align:start position:0%
well I should almost ask representative
wall

04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
wall
 
04:44:40.128 --> 04:44:40.138 align:start position:0%
um if they are able to provide us the
 
04:44:42.288 --> 04:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
language that
 
04:44:45.770 --> 04:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
um would generate the direction of or
 
04:44:47.810 --> 04:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
the pathway for how these complaints are
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
held correct
 
04:44:51.650 --> 04:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
yes they've I'm not I can't predict what
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
they will decide next week okay
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think we need to uh like we did before
 
04:44:58.850 --> 04:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
I think we need to wait and see how the
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
04:45:03.890 --> 04:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
um meets and discusses
 
04:45:06.410 --> 04:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
um they will also bring this up in their
 
04:45:09.050 --> 04:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
meeting this this Bill yes and we can
 
04:45:12.288 --> 04:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
use this as a vehicle to do what it is
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
we want to do all right um I'm good
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%

and we have
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%

05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to introduce uh house
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution six
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
so this bill addresses a pressing issue
 
05:02:39.770 --> 05:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
that affects us all the right to
 
05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
self-determination the fundamental
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
principle that all people have the right
 
05:02:45.470 --> 05:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
to govern themselves is one that has
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
been fought for throughout history
 
05:02:50.448 --> 05:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
yet despite centuries of warfare we have
 
05:02:52.850 --> 05:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
made no progress towards this end we've
 
05:02:54.050 --> 05:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
still witnessed instances where
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
governments use violence and military
 
05:02:57.770 --> 05:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
action against those who seek to govern
 
05:02:57.780 --> 05:02:59.090 align:start position:0%
action against those who seek to govern
themselves

05:02:59.090 --> 05:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:03:00.650 --> 05:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
it is important to remember that no
 
05:03:02.090 --> 05:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
government is Justified in using
 
05:03:04.368 --> 05:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
violence against its own citizens or any
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
other group of people seeking
 
05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
self-governments the use of such tactics
 
05:03:10.610 --> 05:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
is a clear violation of Human Rights an
 
05:03:12.170 --> 05:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
attack on the basic principles of
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
freedom and liberty it is a stark
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
reminder of the oppressive regime
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
regimes of the past and serves a warning
 
05:03:21.288 --> 05:03:21.298 align:start position:0%
of what will can happen if we do not
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
uphold the values of democracy and
 
05:03:23.280 --> 05:03:25.250 align:start position:0%
uphold the values of democracy and
self-determination

05:03:25.250 --> 05:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
05:03:26.930 --> 05:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
initiating violence against those who
 
05:03:28.550 --> 05:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
seek to govern themselves is not only a
 
05:03:31.010 --> 05:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
barbaric act but also goes against the
 
05:03:32.510 --> 05:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
very essence of what it means to live in
 
05:03:34.730 --> 05:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
a free Society it sends a message of
 
05:03:36.650 --> 05:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
fear and intimidation and undermines the
 
05:03:38.570 --> 05:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of individuals to
 
05:03:40.730 --> 05:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
choose their own destiny
 
05:03:43.128 --> 05:03:43.138 align:start position:0%
we must acknowledge that the right to
 
05:03:44.570 --> 05:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
self-determination is not just a
 
05:03:46.250 --> 05:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
political issue but a moral one as well
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
it is our duty to stand up for the
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
rights of all people regardless of their
 
05:03:52.490 --> 05:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
race religion or nationality we must
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
support those who seek to govern
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
themselves and to help create a world
 
05:03:56.930 --> 05:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
where all individuals have the
 
05:03:59.570 --> 05:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity to live in Peace and Freedom
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is affirm that
 
05:04:03.530 --> 05:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
military action against those who choose
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
to self-govern is never appropriate
 
05:04:08.448 --> 05:04:08.458 align:start position:0%
uh I implore you to join me in
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the right to
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
self-determination for all people let us
 
05:04:12.350 --> 05:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
work together to create a world where
 
05:04:14.448 --> 05:04:14.458 align:start position:0%
freedom and liberty are guaranteed and
 
05:04:15.708 --> 05:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
where the use of violence and military
 
05:04:18.170 --> 05:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
action is never Justified against those
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
in the pursuit of self-governance
 
05:04:22.910 --> 05:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
and a couple of things about this bill
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
it's very simple it just says that
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
government is not justifying the use of
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh military action against those who
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
want to self-govern
 
05:04:33.410 --> 05:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of misconceptions what
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
what that actually means is just that
 
05:04:39.890 --> 05:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
um and if people do wish to self-govern
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that as I
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
noticed notice in the uh Declaration of
 
05:04:45.480 --> 05:04:46.610 align:start position:0%
noticed notice in the uh Declaration of
Independence

05:04:46.610 --> 05:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
Independence
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
that they wrote that um
 
05:04:51.770 --> 05:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
you know experience hath shown that
 
05:04:53.868 --> 05:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
mankind are more disposed to Suffer Well
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
Evils are sufferable than to write
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
themselves by abolishing the forms of
 
05:04:59.570 --> 05:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
what they're accustomed so the reason
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
why I bring that up is because what
 
05:05:02.570 --> 05:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
they're saying is basically
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to want to
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
self-govern they're not going to want to
 
05:05:08.270 --> 05:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
go against uh government and start a new
 
05:05:11.330 --> 05:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
one except in extreme cases if you know
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
they'll suffer some evils while they're
 
05:05:14.990 --> 05:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
while they are sufferable like it says
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
in the Declaration of Independence uh so
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh my testimony for this and I
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
will take questions
 
05:05:24.410 --> 05:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%

05:05:30.000 --> 05:05:32.150 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Independence political action
 
05:06:00.830 --> 05:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee we support legislation that
 
05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
yields a proper relationship with the
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
federal government and leads to one day
 
05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
an independent New Hampshire we are
 
05:06:08.090 --> 05:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
proud to support this house concurrent
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you for having me today
 
05:06:12.890 --> 05:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
I believe this let's just I believe this
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to be very self-explanatory
 
05:06:16.970 --> 05:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
the bill is actually not about New
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where 29 of the population
 
05:06:23.448 --> 05:06:23.458 align:start position:0%
supports Independence today 42 supports
 
05:06:24.410 --> 05:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
a vote
 
05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
or even other states and territories in
 
05:06:28.128 --> 05:06:28.138 align:start position:0%
America and around the world today
 
05:06:30.890 --> 05:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
exhibiting a desire for autonomy such as
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
the Texas nationalist movement the yes
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
California initiative the Puerto Rican
 
05:06:37.010 --> 05:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
nationalist Party The Divide New York
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
caucus or free Tibet
 
05:06:41.570 --> 05:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's about being committed to our
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
founding principles this resolution
 
05:06:47.230 --> 05:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's about respecting boundaries
 
05:06:49.730 --> 05:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
relationships and human rights
 
05:06:51.890 --> 05:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's about recognizing that when after
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
some time participating in the social
 
05:06:55.128 --> 05:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
contract with others
 
05:06:57.530 --> 05:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
it might be preferable for one group to
 
05:06:57.540 --> 05:06:58.610 align:start position:0%
it might be preferable for one group to
dissolve

05:06:58.610 --> 05:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
dissolve
 
05:07:02.090 --> 05:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
the relationship it has with another
 
05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
and to explore A New Path in identity
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes we fall out of love with a
 
05:07:08.690 --> 05:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
person and remain together because we
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
like the idea of the relationship more
 
05:07:12.770 --> 05:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
than the person itself
 
05:07:14.810 --> 05:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
upon recognition of this feeling a
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
mature constructive course of action
 
05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
that is respectful of both parties
 
05:07:19.850 --> 05:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
should be taken
 
05:07:22.970 --> 05:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
in 1995 the world witnessed our neighbor
 
05:07:25.490 --> 05:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
to the north Quebec vote to remain in
 
05:07:28.368 --> 05:07:28.378 align:start position:0%
Canada a decade later in 2014 the world
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
also witnessed Scotland vote to remain
 
05:07:32.090 --> 05:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
in the United Kingdom
 
05:07:34.250 --> 05:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
two years following the United Kingdom
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
itself voted to leave the European Union
 
05:07:38.930 --> 05:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
what these three events have in common
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
is that those votes of self-governance
 
05:07:42.550 --> 05:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
were allowed to happen without duress
 
05:07:45.410 --> 05:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
with the people of each Nation freely
 
05:07:47.810 --> 05:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
expressing their will Freedom includes
 
05:07:50.208 --> 05:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
the freedom to leave only six percent of
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
Americans support using military action
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
against any state in the Union that
 
05:07:57.288 --> 05:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
expresses a desire to secede
 
05:07:59.810 --> 05:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you all today to support
 
05:08:01.368 --> 05:08:01.378 align:start position:0%

05:08:03.948 --> 05:08:03.958 align:start position:0%

05:09:09.050 --> 05:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
government perverted and public Liberty
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
manifestly endangered and all other
 
05:09:13.368 --> 05:09:13.378 align:start position:0%
means of redress are ineffectual
 
05:09:15.410 --> 05:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
the people may and of right ought to
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
reform the old or establish a new
 
05:09:17.810 --> 05:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
government the doctrine of
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
non-resistance against arbitrary power
 
05:09:20.810 --> 05:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
and oppression is absurd slavish
 
05:09:22.368 --> 05:09:22.378 align:start position:0%
instructive of the good and happiness of
 
05:09:22.378 --> 05:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
instructive of the good and happiness of
mankind

05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:27.770 --> 05:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
if the members of this committee vote
 
05:09:30.110 --> 05:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
against this bill being as simple as it
 
05:09:31.550 --> 05:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
is there's no confusion what's going on
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
I would argue that they are
 
05:09:37.850 --> 05:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
upholding White Privilege which we must
 
05:09:40.490 --> 05:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
stamp out because how is it that New
 
05:09:42.410 --> 05:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the ability to declare
 
05:09:44.330 --> 05:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
their right to live
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
free of absurd government overreach but
 
05:09:49.010 --> 05:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
we're telling people in the rest of the
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
world you know what you can't do that
 
05:09:53.930 --> 05:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
either we can and everyone can and be
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
self-determination of their their
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
futures or we're saying that somehow due
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
to geopolitical rationale you can be
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
free you can't be free today we like a
 
05:10:05.330 --> 05:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
country in Eastern Europe separating
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we won't I think dishing field
 
05:10:09.530 --> 05:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
and across the board says these
 
05:10:11.930 --> 05:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
principles are Universal
 
05:10:11.940 --> 05:10:15.530 align:start position:0%
principles are Universal
people

05:10:15.530 --> 05:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to revolt against the
 
05:10:19.730 --> 05:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
government that is not serving them that
 
05:10:22.250 --> 05:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
is oppressing them and as representative
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Santa saso say people
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
will not make this step lightly
 
05:10:28.250 --> 05:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
throughout history it's been very
 
05:10:28.260 --> 05:10:29.690 align:start position:0%
throughout history it's been very
expensive

05:10:29.690 --> 05:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
05:10:32.448 --> 05:10:32.458 align:start position:0%
but I do feel that we need to let people
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
know that if they were to make that
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
decision New Hampshire will not support
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
using violence against them that is the
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
key aspect of this you can make all the
 
05:10:42.170 --> 05:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
Declarations that you know you shouldn't
 
05:10:44.090 --> 05:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
separate fine but the day you start
 
05:10:46.550 --> 05:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
shooting at people for saying no we do
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
not want to be part of this government
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
that does not represent our interests
 
05:10:52.490 --> 05:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
I think that's an important thing to say
 
05:10:52.500 --> 05:10:53.930 align:start position:0%
I think that's an important thing to say
and

05:10:53.930 --> 05:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:55.610 --> 05:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
I strongly support the bill would be
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
willing to hear any questions from
 
05:10:58.730 --> 05:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
people as to why they maybe are on the
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
fence I this is kind of important it's
 
05:11:02.750 --> 05:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
very simple so if there's opposition I'd
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
really like to hear what it is so thank
 
05:11:07.610 --> 05:11:07.620 align:start position:0%

05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%

that's my County delegation meetings are
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%

missing a fuse okay I just don't want to

miss all of them
 
05:13:03.288 --> 05:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
just one more it could be just one more
 
05:13:03.298 --> 05:13:04.250 align:start position:0%
just one more it could be just one more
okay

05:13:04.250 --> 05:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
um we
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm envisioning I think is um is we
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
have the ethics meeting next week on a
 
05:13:12.120 --> 05:13:13.850 align:start position:0%
have the ethics meeting next week on a
Monday

05:13:13.850 --> 05:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
05:13:13.860 --> 05:13:14.750 align:start position:0%
Monday
um

05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:18.050 --> 05:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
and then we get into the next week is uh
 
05:13:18.060 --> 05:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
and then we get into the next week is uh
when

05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:13:21.470 --> 05:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
we are supposed to be shut down for that
 
05:13:24.410 --> 05:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
week right is that right it's the
 
05:13:25.690 --> 05:13:25.700 align:start position:0%
following one yeah
 
05:13:28.490 --> 05:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
so we have a we have a session though on
 
05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
the 14th
 
05:13:33.410 --> 05:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
day um and the
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
I so we're oh we're possible on the 20th
 
05:13:40.550 --> 05:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
to the 24th 20th is a holiday 22nd 23rd
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
or session
 
05:13:45.050 --> 05:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
so we're not gonna meet on that week
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
that I can see right then the following
 
05:13:50.570 --> 05:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
week is the school week okay so now
 
05:13:53.810 --> 05:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
we're into the sixth the week of the
 
05:13:53.820 --> 05:13:54.770 align:start position:0%
we're into the sixth the week of the
sixth

05:13:54.770 --> 05:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
sixth
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
and we need to probably meet I'm going
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
to say on the sixth okay and do
 
05:14:04.670 --> 05:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.490 --> 05:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't look right oh it's just bad
 
05:14:07.500 --> 05:14:08.628 align:start position:0%
that doesn't look right oh it's just bad
luck

05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
luck
 
05:14:10.250 --> 05:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's bad luck yeah that would be very
 
05:14:10.260 --> 05:14:11.090 align:start position:0%
it's bad luck yeah that would be very
very

05:14:11.090 --> 05:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:14:11.100 --> 05:14:15.310 align:start position:0%
very
um

05:14:15.310 --> 05:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.570 --> 05:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
so so we are supposed to be able to
 
05:14:20.580 --> 05:14:21.470 align:start position:0%
so so we are supposed to be able to
um

05:14:21.470 --> 05:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:24.410 --> 05:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
the closing date would be the 15th what
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
could we meet the 13th that Monday
 
05:14:27.480 --> 05:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
could we meet the 13th that Monday
um

05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%

amendments to these
 
05:14:40.030 --> 05:14:40.040 align:start position:0%

not only at Mondays really the only days
 
05:15:06.830 --> 05:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm trying to stay away from
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
um Tuesday and Wednesday because that's
 
05:15:09.000 --> 05:15:10.368 align:start position:0%
um Tuesday and Wednesday because that's
when

05:15:10.368 --> 05:15:10.378 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County and I don't know
 
05:15:15.650 --> 05:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
what the situation is currently with
 
05:15:17.770 --> 05:15:17.780 align:start position:0%
environment and AG
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
but those are Tuesday and Wednesdays

05:15:57.230 --> 05:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
well we're just we're suffering from a
 
05:15:59.090 --> 05:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
little bit of you know holidays get

automatic no for everyone
 
05:16:15.288 --> 05:16:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.650 --> 05:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.660 --> 05:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
05:16:26.690 --> 05:16:26.700 align:start position:0%
what's next Monday next Monday is when
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
ethics is meeting at three in the
 
05:16:28.440 --> 05:16:31.970 align:start position:0%
ethics is meeting at three in the
afternoon

05:16:31.970 --> 05:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.980 --> 05:16:32.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:16:32.810 --> 05:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds like I need of the of the
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday what's the
 
05:16:42.890 --> 05:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
best option for anybody
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
or is there a no option for anybody no
 
05:16:49.970 --> 05:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays I'm sorry no Tuesdays for me no
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays so of the Wednesdays and
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
Thursdays is there is there any that
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want that
 
05:17:05.690 --> 05:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
um yeah it would depend on
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
which one you're
 
05:17:09.410 --> 05:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
attempting to do okay
 
05:17:09.420 --> 05:17:11.090 align:start position:0%
attempting to do okay
so

05:17:11.090 --> 05:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at what were the two days
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
that after the 14th of this this
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:22.970 --> 05:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
those are the two days that I was
 
05:17:22.980 --> 05:17:23.868 align:start position:0%
those are the two days that I was
thinking

05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
05:17:23.878 --> 05:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
thinking
um

05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:27.770 --> 05:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
um how about the eighth and Ninth
 
05:17:32.810 --> 05:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
of March
 
05:17:32.820 --> 05:17:35.150 align:start position:0%
of March
good

05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:17:37.208 --> 05:17:37.218 align:start position:0%
no problems
 
05:17:39.530 --> 05:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
what day would that be
 
05:17:43.628 --> 05:17:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:48.050 --> 05:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
so here's where I think we have a winner
 
05:17:50.690 --> 05:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming Vanessa's okay
 
05:17:53.930 --> 05:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
um if that it works maybe we can I'll
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
try to get ahead of
 
05:17:58.010 --> 05:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
or find out from the other two
 
05:18:01.010 --> 05:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
committees if I can have either or both
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
of those days and then um
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
and then we can
 
05:18:09.890 --> 05:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
that will give us opportunity
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
to either clean up something or get the
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
or get the amendments in and discussed
 
05:18:17.930 --> 05:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
and and we could probably exec
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
everything in the afternoon and do the
 
05:18:20.810 --> 05:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
work session in the morning like we did
 
05:18:23.270 --> 05:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
today and then be done
 
05:18:25.610 --> 05:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
and and then it would give us enough
 
05:18:29.570 --> 05:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
time if it is the eighth Wednesday we
 
05:18:31.010 --> 05:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
could actually get it in the calendar
 
05:18:34.850 --> 05:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
right that Wednesday
 
05:18:36.170 --> 05:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
um which is another
 
05:18:38.810 --> 05:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
part for us to have to worry about not
 
05:18:38.820 --> 05:18:40.128 align:start position:0%
part for us to have to worry about not
you

05:18:40.128 --> 05:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
um but it is um I think that may not be
 
05:18:46.730 --> 05:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
bad so try to keep the eighth and Ninth
 
05:18:50.570 --> 05:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
flexible and I will promise that I'll as
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible get
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.208 --> 05:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
um so how do you see where it's sucking
 
05:19:02.448 --> 05:19:02.458 align:start position:0%
when and we're doing Workshop when I
 
05:19:04.610 --> 05:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
would say exec in the afternoon and
 
05:19:08.690 --> 05:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.890 --> 05:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
and if I try for the uh
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
I could potentially try to lock in both
 
05:19:18.410 --> 05:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
days and then
 
05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
if we don't get something done we can
 
05:19:24.170 --> 05:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.490 --> 05:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.500 --> 05:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's the thing I mean if I can
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
always we can be done and then we don't
 
05:19:37.550 --> 05:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
have to use the next day
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
I have to think of a clever way to word
 
05:19:39.360 --> 05:19:40.850 align:start position:0%
I have to think of a clever way to word
that

05:19:40.850 --> 05:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:43.490 --> 05:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to say
 
05:19:47.810 --> 05:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.170 --> 05:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
which is a month from now
 
05:19:55.850 --> 05:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.050 --> 05:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
what's that because it's Monday
 
05:20:04.730 --> 05:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
because what he mentioned it early on
 
05:20:07.610 --> 05:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
was it a Monday because it's a Monday
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
no I don't think we need it I think I
 
05:20:11.750 --> 05:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't remember who's had the problem
 
05:20:14.030 --> 05:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
with it yeah six six is tough yeah okay
 
05:20:16.368 --> 05:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
05:20:16.378 --> 05:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
that's why
um

05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:20.448 --> 05:20:20.458 align:start position:0%
all right I'm gonna say that
 
05:20:22.550 --> 05:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
um our magic days are the eighth and 9th
 
05:20:25.550 --> 05:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
and um and we'll try to get everything
 
05:20:25.560 --> 05:20:26.868 align:start position:0%
and um and we'll try to get everything
done

05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
keep that open as much as you can and if
 
05:20:32.510 --> 05:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
keep the afternoon
 
05:20:37.610 --> 05:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
available so that because the afternoon
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
will be when we exact not the morning
 
05:20:40.798 --> 05:20:43.550 align:start position:0%
will be when we exact not the morning
okay

05:20:43.550 --> 05:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.010 --> 05:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
good all right
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
um unless anybody has anything else to
 
05:20:50.810 --> 05:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
deal with I'm going to uh
 
05:20:53.330 --> 05:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
lock up for the day thank you very much
