Among Us board

members we receive approximately 25 to
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
35 cases a year some cases are resolved
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly uh which is always
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
our goal uh while more complex cases can
 
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
years uh a little bit about our budget
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
now historically the Personnel appeals
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
board has been a component within uh the
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
division of
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
personnel uh last legislative session
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
487 established that the PAB should be
 
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
an independent state
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
agency thus we are coming before you
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
with our very first operating budget
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
this budget is consistent with the
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was attached to the
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
our

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
budget request total for
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
$353,500

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
$353,500
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
33477 we are a generally funded
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
agency the budget includes routine
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
operating costs such as office supplies
 
00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:31.710 align:start position:0%
operating costs such as office supplies
equipment

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.909 align:start position:0%
equipment
utilities

um and information technology software
and

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
Hardware our class 50 line uh which is
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
the part-time uh Personnel line includes
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
two new hope that doesn't alarm you too
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
much but I want to be straightforward um
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
to new part-time Personnel to manage the
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
board's operations a program director
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
and a
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
pargal this Staffing plan uh is modeled
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
after the PE lb the personal the public
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
employees Labor Relations Board which
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
has an executive director a paralal and
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
several attorneys on
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
staff these two part-time positions are
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
new people so are you saying these two
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
people are not yet hired correct I see
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you correct it's it part of what
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
we're doing in this particular budget is
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
building the infrastructure to be an
 
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.829 align:start position:0%
building the infrastructure to be an
independent

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
agency um for startup costs fiscal year
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
2026 you'll notice that 26 is a little
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
higher than 27 which is not usually the
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
case in a banal budget r26 includes
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
um onetime expenses such as office
 
00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.670 align:start position:0%
um onetime expenses such as office
furniture

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
furniture
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
computers um and other
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
equipment I wanted to talk really
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
quickly about the ways that we
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
already try to manage our budget
 
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
already try to manage our budget
efficiently

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
um uh we put forth a um very
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
lean um budget request for you um the
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
part-time staff versus full-time staff
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
um partly because our case load doesn't
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
warrant a full-time staff person but
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
also we're trying to um stay away from
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
the added expense of benefits of a
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
full-time staff person um this does
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
include funding for four board members
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
rather than the authorized five
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
um searching for we are we don't even
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
have our own space yet we're we're
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
working on that as we speak um we are
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
looking for um part
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
state-owned office space and courtroom
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
hearing space um rather than having to
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
rent out privately are you saying there
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
aren't five members of the board
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
there interestingly enough
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I've been on the board since
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
2017 um we've always had
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
four um and more recently we've dropped
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
down to three we are required to have a
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
three for a quorum so if we only have
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
three board members to work with it
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us any flexibility if
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's out sick that sort of thing
 
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.069 align:start position:0%
somebody's out sick that sort of thing
um

00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
involves you know delay of of hearings
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
which is very costly for everybody
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
involved are board members paid board
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
members are pay to stien yes so much per
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
day per hour for we get um we get uh
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
$400 per day for a day of hearings plus
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh $200 every two weeks for work done
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
outside of hearings such as prep work um
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
writing decisions that sort of thing
 
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
gotcha yes representative evil I I don't
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
want to jump ahead of your presentation
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
but um put right I was just going to ask
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
Jack if he could get us the related bill
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
that did this but I'm I'm not familiar
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
with this did you say you originally is
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
under Das yes so to some extent um while
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
some of this general fund use may be new
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
some of it was already being expended
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
when you were part of Das yeah do do you
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
know what the the difference is I mean
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
you Pro did you share space with them
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
to we have relied on the space and staff
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
and resources um from admin
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
services I don't want to speak on their
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
behalf but I think they would tell you
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
that our departure does not leave a big
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
enough hole
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
that their could be reduced or that we
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
could bring those Resources with us
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
right I guess I I was mostly trying to
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
just identify the the connection there
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
so for us because we're hearing we're
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
hearing the budgets of many sorts of
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
boards like this so thank you yeah
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative MS uh than thank you Mr
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
chair and U for representative eel's
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
benefit I'm looking at the bill right
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
now and uh what's interesting that the
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
bill was a it was a request from the
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services do
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
you do thank you for coming in um do you
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
have any idea what the reason for that
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
was yes I do um there have been so we
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
hear cases from All State agencies
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
um including admin
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
Services um and there have been times
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
when commissioner Arling house has come
 
00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:39.470 align:start position:0%
when commissioner Arling house has come
before

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
us um asking us to uphold a decision
 
00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:49.759 align:start position:0%
that he has made um and it can be very
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
awkward um so we searched around
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
for a better
 
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
home um at one point we thought well
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we would align nicely with the
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice because we do some
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
similar work but they are also state
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
employees um and have the potential to
 
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
come before us so ultimately it was
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
determined that the best route for us to
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
take was to become um an independent
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
agency representative
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I did a
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
quick calculation here based on 25 to 35
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
cases a year it looks like the average
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
case is costing 10 to
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
12,000 that seems to me like a lot of
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
money for an appeal of an administrative
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
decision maybe you could shed some light
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
much I guess the one thing thing I could
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
say in response to your question which
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a very reasonable question um is that
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have this
 
00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.269 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have this
board

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
um these cases would be going through
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
our court
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
system um and be taking
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
up much more
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
expensive um
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
time not only for the court system but
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
for the Representatives that work on
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of these state
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
employees I don't have a figure as to
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
how expensive that would be but just by
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
Logic and what we probably all know
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
about the coure system it is not as
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
efficient a route as this process is
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
here um thank you you follow okay let me
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
ask you on this I assume this $400 a day
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
and $200 a day that's not new right
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
you've been doing that for a while yeah
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
so how many days were there um in fiscal
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
year last year last year fiscal year
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
24 um of the 400 type and of the 200
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
type well the 200 is paid out every two
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
weeks so that's essentially $400 a month
 
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.670 align:start position:0%
weeks so that's essentially $400 a month
times

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
12 okay so that's all automatic sort of
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
right yes yes got you okay so so 25
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
weeks per year per person yes and you
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
now have three right so yeah correct
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha um I I will comment that um
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council approved a new
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
board member at their last
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
meeting um and they are scheduled to
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
approve a fifth member at their next
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting understand okay um and
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
um and so how many days of hearings did
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
you have we probably had you know this I
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
I did I did the math um I think there
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
were 20 24 days of hearings yes and
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes you might have a two-day
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
hearing there's also a rule there's also
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
a rule that says um if you have cases
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
pending you can't go more than 30 days
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
without a meeting to keep the pressure
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
on to move it through but but I think I
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
think um in last year's budget or the
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
budget cycle we're in I think um there's
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of hidden costs in there that uh
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
Personnel Department was picking up
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's already a woman uh Lisa who's
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
moving on to another position that
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much does what the uh
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
administrative staff is doing scheduling
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
getting orders then there's a right to
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
no request and it's taken forever to put
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
the record together and a lot of news
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
media pushing and then the Supreme Court
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
appeal so there is one employee already
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
doing quite a bit of this work but and
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
she's not paid
 
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
independent right she's absorbed in the
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
Das budget somewhere yeah yeah okay and
 
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
in the 24 days of
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
hearings do you have all the board
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
members who are available go to that
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
hearing or is it you pick three and and
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
we'll take three for that hearing um
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
we given that we haven't had a full
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
compliment of five until just recently
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
um we typically have all board members
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
attend I I think it is
 
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
attend I I think it is
helpful

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to the decisions that
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
the board makes to have a variety of
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
experiences and opinions at the table
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
Griffin um thank you thank you for
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question um are the decisions
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the board final or do people have the
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
court they do have the ability to appeal
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
they typically will ask us for
 
00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:14.919 align:start position:0%
reconsideration if they think that we've
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
missed something important in our
 
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
missed something important in our
deliberation

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
deliberation
 
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.270 align:start position:0%
deliberation
um

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
and we will deliberate those
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
reconsideration requests um they
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
do have the right to go to Supreme
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
Court represent months repes and
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
followed by representative R thank thank
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
my question again I have I have two two
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
questions um first just to make sure I'm
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm clear the State Labor Relations
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
Board they handle all the
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
union issues correct correct they handle
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
contractual issues corre we handle
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
um non-union nonunion per state
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
Personnel rules only okay all right that
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
was my first question thank you and then
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
secondly um and and thank you for for uh
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
explaining the rationale for creating an
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
independent agency so I I I I understand
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
that now um but given given that um I'm
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
previously you were housed within the
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
physically yes um is there any reason
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
you couldn't continue to be housed there
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
physically using your exact same your
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
your your exact space without
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
needing um you know without forfeiting
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
independent right now
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
we share a part we share part of a
 
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.710 align:start position:0%
we share a part we share part of a
person

00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
um who also has other duties within um
 
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.390 align:start position:0%
um who also has other duties within um
administrative

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
Services um the space that we have there
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
is her
 
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.990 align:start position:0%
is her
cubby

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
cubby
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
with um all her other files and other
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
work that
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
exists so to be an independent state
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
agency we are going to need our own
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
address our own
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
telephone um so that our our repr the
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
lawyers and and the staff who need our
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
services know where to go
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
to seek our
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
resources I think it would it's a let me
 
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.669 align:start position:0%
resources I think it would it's a let me
just

00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
say it would not achieve the level of
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
Independence that's um contemplated all
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
right follow up
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and thank you again for that
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
explanation um given the fact that um
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
there is some similarity between the
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
work that you do and the State Labor
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
Relations Board granted it's a different
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
population that you're
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
serving is there have you looked at the
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity of maybe collocating with
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
them yes yes we did early on in this um
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
disc discussion to be
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
independent um I went over there to
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
explore with their executive director
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
Douglas ingersol it's been a couple
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
years since I've talked to him so I had
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
to resurrect his name um I went over
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
there just to talk about how is their
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
budget organized what does their office
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
set up look like um and and actually to
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
see if he had the space and the desire
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
to partner with us um
 
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.470 align:start position:0%
to partner with us um
and

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
he was not interested in doing so for
 
00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:18.110 align:start position:0%
he was not interested in doing so for
whatever

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
reason okay all right representative R
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so how many
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
employees what are the potential number
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
of employees that you serve because
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
you're not serving the employees who are
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
under a collective bargaining agreement
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
correct state employees have a
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
collective baring agreement and
 
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
collective baring agreement and
also

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.070 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.350 align:start position:0%
also
[Music]

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
are um not only responsible but the
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
state is responsible for complying with
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
Personnel administrative
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
rules so we hear cases that claim
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
violation of administ ative rule even
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
state employees if they have a
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining issue will go to the other
 
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.190 align:start position:0%
bargaining issue will go to the other
elrb

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
elrb
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
organization okay so you potentially
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
could hear cases from any employee in
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
the state employ state employee okay and
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
how many do you know how many there are
 
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
total I 10 12,000 the last but it's been
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
a few years since
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
I've worked full-time in stake govern so
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
that might be stale so don't okay and
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
you hear about you said 25 to 30 a year
 
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
has that been consistent I mean you've
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
only been in operation for a couple
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
years so since 86 oh 86 okay yeah and
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
actually we existed under prior under a
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
different model even prior to 86 so
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
we've been around
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
for close to a century okay so have you
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
seen the number of employees cases come
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
before you increase over that time or
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
have they stayed pretty steady certainly
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
I we have a um our website has an annual
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
report required to do an annual report I
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
looked at it yesterday I'm sorry I
 
00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it but it is online and it
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
has like a 10-year list of how many
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
cases how many were dismissed how many
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
were approved how many were a lot of
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
them are settled because they start
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's a free interchange of
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
information between the employee uh the
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
union representative of SE rep or they
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
have independent councel and the agency
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
councel and so there are some years I
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
know in the last uh 10 and I've only
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
been on the board a year and a half that
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
there were upwards of 40 cases but so um
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
and and the the issues are you have a
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
big Personnel uh code that they if if
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't get the reclassification
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
or didn't get the right what they think
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
is a proper discipline they bring it to
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
us and we have some discretion to decide
 
00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:58.750 align:start position:0%
us and we have some discretion to decide
what

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
um is appropriate they may have been
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
terminated for something and maybe the
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
the next level I think is like a 20-day
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
suspension without pay and then we could
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a warning and some other things so
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's kind of and and I've never been
 
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.430 align:start position:0%
it's kind of and and I've never been
part

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
of organization I've been an independent
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
attorney and it's interesting to see the
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
the Dynamics of what goes on within an
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
agency and whether it's somebody was uh
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
applying a different standard um to a um
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
to an older person who may not not be as
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
familiar with what they U what is the
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
respect and civility code that came in
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
in 2020s some we see some older uh
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
people coming in older employees that
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
don't kind of seem to understand that so
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
maybe the maybe a termination is not
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing but so um and it
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
offers a fairly hopefully expeditious
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
way of dealing with it rather than have
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
it going to court and the court has to
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
set you up in 3 months and 6 months and
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
nine months and then if we reverse it
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
then you're faced with the issue of the
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
employeer is re reinstated with back pay
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
and you don't want to have a year or two
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
of back pay laying out there as well
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
you'd rather get an expeditious uh
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
decision fairly quickly so okay a couple
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
more questions yeah go ahead Andes so um
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
the cases that you've heard that you've
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
made decisions upon what I you know just
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
approximately how what percentage would
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
you say supports the Management's
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
decision regarding that situation and
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
the percentage that support the
 
00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:31.470 align:start position:0%
the percentage that support the
employees

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
position I I I I think I looked at the
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
last year's annual report that ended
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
June 30th last year and there were 22
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
cases there were there were four that
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
were overturned that found for the
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
employee okay uh there were nine that
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
were dismissed and there were nine that
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
were settled which we don't we just get
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
case withdrawn we don't know which way
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
it went we assume if it was settled
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
either the employee got tired found
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
another job or the state so the settled
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
count is part of this 30 cases a year
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
roughly yes and so there's pressure
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
there to do it and and I assume um you
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
you can also go to the website literally
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
go back and they classify disciplinary
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
termination classification letters of
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
warning and you literally can go back
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
and pull up somebody's you can
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
alphabetically pull up a case from 1986
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
I mean it goes continuously and that's
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
part of the in the budget for us to
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
maintain that website which we're going
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
to lose from uh from administrative
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
services so and that that provides some
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
guidance I think as well for the state
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
as well as the employees they certainly
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
there's more than 22 employees that get
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of discipline within the year
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
the question is and there's also before
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
it gets to us there's a five-step
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
process where internally with the agency
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
they will start talking let's do this
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
and then the union rep comes in and then
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
they go to this and they go to that so
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's like four or five steps before
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
they ever then they get the final
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
decision and then they have 15 days to
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
file with us so um we don't know how
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
they turn out we don't know how many
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
settled because there's some precedent
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't that wasn't a
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
terminable offense it was only a 20-day
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
offense or it was only a letter of
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
warning okay thank you sorry that take
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
so long no it's very interesting you
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
said the website is going away what do
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
you mean by that so I don't think
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel um uh I don't think uh
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
administrative Services wants to carry
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
it we're going to have to move it over
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
so we have to set up a website to carry
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
this and and then and we're trying to
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
get as I understand it um Mary Lee is is
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
more into the technical aspects within
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
setting up the agency but
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
um um we're we're TR I'm sorry I lost my
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
point we're trying to um do it like the
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
court system system and you know that
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
you can go in you can look at all the
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
filings all you can do is just hit it
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
and you can look at the whole pleading
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to somebody you know right
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
now we have a rule original in five
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
copies you know I'm I'm a veteran and
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still living by paper doing as
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
much on internet but presumably doit can
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
keep your pages current yeah we're
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
working we're working with them aren't
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
we yes okay yes so yep okay very good
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
any other representative eil just really
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
quickly because we're at the end of the
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
line here um so if there's an appeal
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
that has to be filed does it have to go
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
through your board first or do people
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to also go to the
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
Superior Court they have to go through
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
our board first okay that's the process
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay and how many times
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
are you appealed to court very
 
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:55.519 align:start position:0%
infrequently I guess
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
or um interestingly when I first joined
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
the board it was very rare that a case
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
went to Superior Court um more recently
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say within the last year
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
and a half to two years um our cases
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
have been much more um
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
contentious um and
 
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.310 align:start position:0%
contentious um and
contested

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
contested
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
and we've had we've probably got four
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
cases right now four or five cases cases
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
before Superior Court um from from both
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
sides some from the state didn't like
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
our decision and some of the terminated
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
employees didn't like her decision okay
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
does that do you your any of your board
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
members then have to go to court or not
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
really we do not have to go to court but
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
we do provide them with a huge amount of
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
information um you're right up for them
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
to make their
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you very much AG that uh
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
advises us gotcha okay thank you all
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%

00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
about it um so let's go to we have next
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities and they are on page 156 to
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
158 and the the important thing to

notice about these guys is I believe
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
they are 100% federal funds you stole my
 
00:32:37.399 --> 00:32:38.950 align:start position:0%

introduce
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
yourself good
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
morning good morning my name is isidora
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
Rodriguez legendre I serve as the
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
executive director at the New Hampshire
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
Council on developmental
 
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities as you stated uh we are
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
100% federally funded through um a
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
federal law that we lovingly refer to as
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
the DD act so it's the developmental
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities assistance and Bill of
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
Rights Act most recently reauthorized in
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
2000 um which states that every state
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
and territory should have a
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
Council uh dedicated to identifying the
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
most pressing needs of individuals with
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities in that state and or
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
territory and then we develop a
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
five-year plan to address those needs um
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
what I uh say is that we could not do
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
what we do without collaboration and so
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
most we collaborate with other entities
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
including the State Department of Health
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
and Human Services Bureau of
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
Developmental services and other
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
disability related
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
organizations um how we differ from the
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
governor's Council on disability it's
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
usually a question I get is that um our
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
charge is very specifically for
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
individuals with intellectual and
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and are
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
guiding federal law is the DD act
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
whereas they their guiding federal law
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
is the Ada and they're more concerned
 
00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:31.149 align:start position:0%
is the Ada and they're more concerned
with

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
accessibility um and uh are not limited
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
to a specific disability so they serve
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
you know individuals who are blind DEA
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
in heart of hearing Etc whereas we are
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
very specifically uh developmental
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities and those are disabilities
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
identified before the age of 22 which
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
are expected to have a lifelong impact
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
on people's lives and um more often than
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
not depend on lifelong supports and
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
services through um uh Medicaid funded
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
Services typically um to provide support
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities um I've
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
provided for you just the general kind
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
of um information about our mission the
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
DD act itself um and Council membership
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
so by law 60% of our membership must be
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
individuals impacted by intellectual and
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
developmental disab abilities and or
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
parents are guardians of individuals who
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
cannot advocate for themselves because
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
of a developmental disability um and
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
then uh I also provided an infographic
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
of both our um mission statement and our
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
Five-Year Plan we have two main goals
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that is quality of life to address
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
barriers of daily living for people with
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities and what that typically
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
means is removing those barriers that
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
limit access to participation in
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
People's Community um and then the other
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
goal is related to advocacy and training
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
so we partner with a lot of
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
organizations to do like voter rights
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
trainings and um provide uh technical
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
assistance for information access how to
 
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.829 align:start position:0%
assistance for information access how to
make

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
materials um easy to read or um provide
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
infographics for those who have very
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
limited uh reading capab ility um the
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
last hand that I provided to you is our
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
most recent notice of award I find it
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
helpful to kind of explain a little bit
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
about how our funding works so on an
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
annual basis Congress desde decides what
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
our um Federal award will be in their
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
budget as you can imagine we don't know
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
what that will be yet since we are in a
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution and we've kind of
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
gotten uh our little chunks of funding
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um through the continuing resolution
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
period so right now we've received
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
$121 uh
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
,000 um through the continuing
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
resolution and then once Congress uh
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
decides on a budget we will know what we
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
will get for the rest of the year we
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
work on a federal fiscal year and our
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
grant award even though it's annually
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
alloted is good for a 2-year period so
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
that allows us to carry funds forward um
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing that's important
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
to know about our organization is that
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
we work on a reimbursement so federal
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
funds are spent the state kind of fronts
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
us the operating expenses and then we
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
draw down and we're currently drawing
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
down on a monthly basis to uh to
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state for the costs of
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
operating our program we have three
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
full-time positions and three part-time
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
positions um we're not requesting any
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
new positions um but we are eliminating
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
a full-time position that we had on the
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
books that is no longer being funded um
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty you had been for
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
fulltime so no so what happened was
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we found it very
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill positions and we had
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
decided that what we were going to do is
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
split one of those full-time positions
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
into two part-time positions in the
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
hopes that we could get you know a mom
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
that needed mother's hours or something
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
like that to be able to do the two
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
pieces um one was related to projects
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
and one was related to kind of policy
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
work or following bills during the
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
legislative session um which we do a
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
fair amount of since a lot of bills are
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
related to developmental disabilities
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
access and inclusion um and it didn't
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
really work out we found an individual
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
to fill one of the part-time positions
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
and decided that instead of continuing
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
to try and recruit for the second one to
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
just make that position full-time and so
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually replaced the one that was
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
on the books previously gotcha now uh
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
one of the big increases in your budget
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
is in class 72 fed grants so you're
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
handing out grants yes and in 2024 it
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
was only $30,000 but now it's going up
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
to 200 plus yeah so what is that about
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great question thank you for
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
asking so a lot of how we do our work is
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
through grants we have about seven
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
different types of Grants we have grants
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
for individuals grants for organizations
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
something that we call um Innovation
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
grants so for a new idea on how to
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
better include people with disabilities
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
in community um so we kind of put those
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
out and we get applications for those um
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
in that year we had very few I would say
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
fewer grants than what we budgeted for
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that um the the
 
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
federal government requires us to have
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
an objective on our fiveyear plan
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
related to what they call a targeted
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
disparity and our targeted disparity we
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
intended to put out a an RFP we did
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
actually put an RFP twice and did not
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
get applicants and so we had a blotted a
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
big chunk of our funding towards that
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
work and it didn't get funded and that's
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
kind of why we hope we anticipate being
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
able to address that goal again through
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
grants this coming
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
vium um so we have again allotted the
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
funding it's anybody's guess if we will
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
be able to contract uh successfully but
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're hopeful that we would be
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
able to do that does that kind of
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
funding la if you don't spend it it does
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
not lapse um our funding because it's
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement by reimbursement if we
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
don't spend it we don't draw it down so
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's still kind of in the bank uh
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for us to uh in the federal bank
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
or in the in the Federal in the Federal
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
Bank I see so does that mean and it's
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
not frozen at the moment so so because
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
because you didn't spend it in 2004 you
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
could you could spend it in 2005
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
because we have a 2year um project
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
period and what's uh helpful with that
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
is as we go through the year and see how
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
our funding is shaping up we can
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
actually put more funding into other
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
types of Grants or activities to not
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
have so high of a carry forward moving
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
forward so actually in the governor's
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
budget um the uh uh the
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
authorized um amounts for the next bium
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
are guesstimates based on what we've
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
been receiving annually about you know
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
between $450 and
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
$550,000 a year so we have a small
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
budget but we typically carry forward
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
between two and
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
$300,000 so that in the event of
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
government shutdowns and continuing
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
resolutions we still have funds on which
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
to draw while we're waiting to hear from
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
Congress what our allotment will be for
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
the next fiscal year now do you ever
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
deal with cases or individuals who have
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
complaints or something like that no we
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
do a fair amount of referrals to um
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
different entities responsible for those
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
things so we refer people to for example
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
the cap program at the governor's
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability if they have an
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
issue with VOC Vocational Rehabilitation
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
we refer people to the disability rights
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
center for legal Assistance or
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
information if they have a a rights
 
00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
violation issue we do get a lot of calls
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
related to things like you know neglect
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
abuse exploitation and we refer those
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately to the entities that are
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for investigating those
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
gotcha representative Ms thank you Mr
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for coming in and um as
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
a father of a young man with a
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
developmental disability thank you for
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
all the work that um the council has
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
been doing over the years to raise um
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
visibility um just a question for you uh
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
a two-part question around the same
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
theme um have you experienced any uh
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
difficulties drawing down federal funds
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
in the last couple
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
months so there there was about a week
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
and a half there where all of the
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
federal systems for drawing down were
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
unavailable um but
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
since that time we've drawn down twice
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
and without there have been additional
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
delays but nothing sign what I would
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
call significant and maybe it takes an
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
extra week to get our funding into the
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
State Bank okay thank you and then the
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
second question is um and I and I know
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to um to to predict but
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
have you gotten any sense at all as to
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know how your funding may be
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
affected by some of the um uh uh
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
proposals to uh reduce federal spending
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
that is a great question um so uh as
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
many federally funded
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
entities uh we are cautiously optimistic
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
we have been told by our National
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
Organization to prepare for
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
contingencies that may uh
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
significantly impact our funding um
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
however uh our review of the federal law
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
the DD act does indicate a minimum
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
allotment amount of somewhere in the
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
realm of
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
$400,000 so we're hopeful that I mean
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
unless they change the federal law um
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
that we will at least be able to receive
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
certainly the last couple of months have
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
caused a lot of confusion about what can
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
and can't be done related to funding um
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
but we are um created by the DD act and
 
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
funded through the DD act so our
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
cautious optimism is that that cannot
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
easily be
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
defunded um although there were attempts
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
in the first Administration
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
to um in this president first
 
00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.670 align:start position:0%
to um in this president first
Administration

00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
to um combine different Federal funded
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
disability programs that was not
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
successful we do have a lot of members
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
of Congress that are app parents and and
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
that understand the importance of our
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
work and of inclusion in community for
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
so again our our understanding is that
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
um regardless of U political we're
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan entity and so we feel as
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
though there are sufficient people in
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
Congress to that really get what we do
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
and that um understand the impact that
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
we have in the state and it's not that
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
much money right it's it's less than
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars that's in the DD
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
act so so okay representative R thank
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
question um do you have a website or an
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
annual report where I can learn more
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
about your this specific projects that
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
are funded through your office yes we
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
have both um and I would be happy to
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
send uh the annual report and the
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
website link to the committee membership
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
that would be great thank you sure all
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
right now you you showed us this example
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
of a grant of
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
$121,000 is this the kind of thing you
 
00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.870 align:start position:0%
$121,000 is this the kind of thing you
get

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
quarterly monthly some other kind of
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
regular schedule so so it's interesting
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um because
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
I've I've been here for um coming up on
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
nine years and it really es and flows
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
from from year to year it's hard to
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
predict um there are certain grants that
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
we expect annually to support different
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
congre conferences and training
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
activities we also have a pretty um
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
wellp publicized accessibility Grant so
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
if any group or organization is putting
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
on a community event and they need ASL
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
interpreters or cart captioning Services
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
they can apply to our organizations for
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
funds to assist in paying for those
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
things which improves the accessibility
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities in New
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but other than that it's
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
really difficult unless we have a
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
specific Target in our Five-Year Plan
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
because all of our grants are are driven
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
by our 5-year plan and and The Five-Year
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
Plan is driven by the m MIP of the
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
council um it's really hard to tell how
 
00:48:33.549 --> 00:48:33.559 align:start position:0%
many Grant requests we're going to get
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
in a year and kind of for how much um
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
we've done a number of really great and
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
interesting uh grants recently for
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
things like accessible playgrounds
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
accessible hiking trails um really uh
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
accessible we did one for an accessible
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
boat launch um uh the um
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
the Autobon put in uh push doors for uh
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
folks who need push doors for entry and
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
we gave them a small amount of money we
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
also um I think the um one of the
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
museums is creating more accessibility
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
like an accessible bathroom things like
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
that um so those are kinds of things
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
that we want and typically fund is
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
things that make the space is um more
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
inclusive in New Hampshire the reason
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
I'm asking this question is you're
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
budgeting for roughly $800,000 a year so
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
in order to meet that you're going to
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
need six or seven of
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
these right
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
so or maybe some of them are bigger or
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever yeah no that's that's a
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um so that
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
800,000 typically a little more than
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
half goes on personnel and overhead
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
right um and then we have uh the council
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
votes on an in internal budget for like
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
how much we're going to put towards
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
Grant on an annual basis and um I think
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
that this is a little bit misleading in
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
that one we don't know what Congress is
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
going to approve in the next bium and so
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
we're going off of what our level
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
funding would be from the last two years
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
um it's not guaranteed though and then
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
the second thing is that this is
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
anticipating a carry forward that is not
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
typical for us we don't typically carry
 
00:50:44.359 --> 00:50:46.109 align:start position:0%
typical for us we don't typically carry
forward

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
$400,000 a year but when we develop the
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
budget we are told in the agency phase
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
for the Governor's phase that we need to
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
put down every single dollar that we
 
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.829 align:start position:0%
put down every single dollar that we
could

00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:03.750 align:start position:0%
could
potentially

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
receive even if that is just a
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
guesstimate and if you end up short then
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
you will dial back absolutely absolutely
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay you want to make
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%

01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
all right it's 11 o'clock please come up
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
and you guys are on page 109 and
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
110 and yeah I guess I just felt that um
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
you were here before but
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
it seemed rushed right
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
so um and and as representative Ms
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out who's not here but he wasn't
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
here they come back again yeah right so
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe uh for the benefit of
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
Representative rang you might want to
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
just give you know a two-minute or three
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
minute explanation of what you do and um
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
how long you've been here and uh so on
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you good morning Kristen
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
monani advocate for special education
 
01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839 align:start position:0%
Tim Lenahan assistant
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate I don't want to repeat a lot of
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
what we said before so I'm I'm going to
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
be very um summary with it uh we did um
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
on the first page of the presentation
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
sort of sketch out what the statutory
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
mandates were and they fall into
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
categories of of case management case
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
resolution in order to ensure that
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
services are provided um Data Tracking
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
in order to understand what's going on
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
um data was something that I I was
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
really surprised in taking the office
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we just don't have as much data
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
um or data that's as accurate on special
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
education as we would really like it to
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
be and we are talking with the
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed about that it's been
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
something that I know they've been
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
focused on for a while and are actually
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
working to get some systems in place um
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
to get us more data I I'll just add to
 
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
that because I'm I'm on I'm on the
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
education funding committee and we've
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
been discussing bills so right now the
 
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
way the state pays for special ed that
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
the the high-end case
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
is something used to be called
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid we now just call it
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
special ed Aid or something I anyways we
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
pay uh there's the Statewide average
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
cost for for education of
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
$21,000 roughly a year and so whenever a
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
particular kid uh a school district is
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
spending on that kid more than three and
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
a half times that Statewide average so
 
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.870 align:start position:0%
a half times that Statewide average so
roughly

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
$70,000 uh maybe 75 $5,000 then the
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
state will pay um the uh 70% of the ne
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
of the costs of that kid up to 10 times
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
that average so up to up to
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
$210,000 okay and then over the $210,000
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
the state will pay 100% okay although
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
there's another issue about this because
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
the overall spending is capped right so
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's a what called pration
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
but anyways but there's a formula and so
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
we have we have bills where we're
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
talking about what if we changed the
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
three and a half
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
times um down to three what would that
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
cost us right and we don't
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
know right because they don't report
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
anything on every special ed kid right
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
how much are we spending on it we know I
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
guess they sort of report overall
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
statistics but the but the problem is
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know they might have somebody on
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
staff who for this kid you know does 10%
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
of their time and on that kid it's 15%
 
01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
of the time and on this you know and so
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
there's no way of
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
knowing or exactly what's the cost of
 
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
Any Given kid right and so and so
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
changing those numbers would be a
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
complete um guessing game of of you know
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
what's the effect on the state budget if
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
we made a change right and so it's very
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
difficult sorry doing so it just to pick
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
up on that so that we're having a fluid
 
01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:10.839 align:start position:0%
conversation um it with some Data
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
Tracking with our understanding from a
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
fieldwork level um in there in the teams
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
looking at IEP by IEP and understanding
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
how to how to cost build in an IEP um
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
we've been also doing policy work um we
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
are getting to the point where we have
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
several Representatives who are reaching
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
out and saying what do you think about
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
this bill tell me about this piece of
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
language even if it's one that we were
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
not involved in putting in front of them
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
and and we've gotten positive feedback
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
on our being kind of useful and very
 
01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
direct um in in that uh with the funding
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
question um I I will say I did um submit
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony to the committee
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
saying you know what about what if it's
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
not three and but two and a half um this
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
data question we we don't have the data
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
we are doing Data Tracking for our own
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
case load but we really do understand
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
what's happening as IEPs get built so as
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
we move towards a model that we
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely need Statewide of Labor
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
costing and being able to really look at
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
each IEP and have districts look at each
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
of their IEPs so that we can get a
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
handle on how we're not trading off
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
between special education and general
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
education as much because that that is a
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
serious tension at the moment in the
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
state as special ed cost rise we we have
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
to be better and we're trying to be
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
involved in that conversation because we
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
really do understand exactly how these
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
these I APS are getting built um we do a
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
very minimal amount of referral sum but
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
honestly more things are referred to us
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
and my colleague is going to talk about
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
that uh a bit I'd just love to say you
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
know as we do this work in case
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
management in Data Tracking in policy um
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
both both promulgating um two
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
legislators suggestions and being there
 
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
for questions and for feedback on bills
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
that come up um we we've asked for a
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
staff of five in the office um have a
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
really concrete kind of plan and idea as
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
to how uh those get used right now it's
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
us um with a very very minimal amount of
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
part-time help um one day or or less a
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
week uh solely based on budget um from
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
from a third
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
person I don't see us coming back and
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
saying if we could get this office of
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
five I don't see us coming back and
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
saying we need more we need more we need
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
more um we really can do some training
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
measures and start to put a lot into the
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
field that we're not finding is there
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
right now um to help private Advocates
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
do some of this work to help parents do
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
some of this work themselves and to make
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
help us deliver special ed services
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
better in a cost-efficient way um we
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
will continue to handle a lot of severe
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
cases right now we're we're looking at
 
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
you know being able to handle and manage
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
about 1% with those five people of the
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
IEP cases the IEPs that we have
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
statewide we have about 30,000 um so so
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
I would say that if we could get to the
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
point where we have five people in the
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
office I'm not going to keep coming back
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
and asking for more um every couple
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
Cycles uh the I'd love this committee to
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
look at what we're not asking for we are
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
not asking for an office manager we are
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
not asking for secretaries we're not
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
asking for legal aids we're not asking
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the pr um line items you know public
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
relations members that some agencies are
 
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
um we we efficiently do a lot of our own
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
work I do what I had a legal secretary
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
to do 20 years ago um that's
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
fine but we do need a few more people to
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
actually do the work of managing cases
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
and doing the Data Tracking um and then
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know the last thing I would say is
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we are working systemwide
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
so we've it it took a while to develop
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
it was just me for a year and then Tim
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
joined me and has been you know seven or
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
eight months um with me Tim jumped right
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
into the work he has a vast kind of
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
experience base that complement what I
 
01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.830 align:start position:0%
experience base that complement what I
have

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
um and we have tried to make sure that
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
we're relevant um for example later
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
today I'm meeting with the head of
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
vocational rehab to say how do we make
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
those dollars do even better for our
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
special ed population here's what we're
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
seeing on the ground in our
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
casework here are suggestions here are
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts I'd love feedback because
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately special education is
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
investment and we need to make sure that
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's actually getting those students to
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
be productive as productive as they
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
possibly can be in society and so things
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
like Voc Rehab vocational rehab that
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
puts people to work as they come out
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
School play into that so we are working
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
systemically um with that I'd love to
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Tim to talk just a bit
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
and take questions on the types of cases
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
and where they're coming from to get to
 
01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
and where they're coming from to get to
us

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
Tim good morning um so a lot of what we
 
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
get and is
 
01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
get and is
from

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.750 align:start position:0%
from
uh

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
either other agencies that have already
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
helped people and have imately reach the
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
stone wall if you will um the office of
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
the child advocate um they're one floor
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
down from us so so it's very convenient
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education dispute
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
resolution as well as um there was a
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
change in their process where whenever a
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
parent does not agree or signs with
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
exception they get a letter from doe and
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
the first name and number on there is us
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh so they it comes direct that happened
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
this fall and we saw a huge Spike um I
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
get a lot of referrals on some of the
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
most catastrophic cases um to use a term
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's been used in the past but um
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
children that have been out of school a
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
year and a half two years and they're
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
all over the state I'm in six counties
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
right now so there's me in in six
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
counties um what I will tell you is is
 
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
that we're also pointing out things to
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
to bring better data to the table for
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
everyone um I when I come across
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
something rather than point fingers and
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
say you did this wrong you did this
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
wrong it's more the we're we're out of
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
compliance here and we need to move
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
forward in in an accurate way whatever
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
that data is it should be accurate so
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
you can rely on it so the governor can
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
rely on it and frankly so we know where
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
to head um to give you you know a
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
snapshot the IEP process if it's in
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
has tons of deadlines and notice
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
requirements weaved throughout it so
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
there there really is I I would say the
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
goal is to resolve everything within one
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
cycle of the IEP and right now we're
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
doing that we are I I you know 6 months
 
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
four months three months those are kind
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
of my average to get to a solution um
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
and there when I say a solution these
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
are ones where people have had the
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities rights Center they've had
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
private Advocates uh I have a woman with
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
a son who's been out of school for 2 and
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
A2 years she spent
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
$225,000 on a private attorney um and
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
she was fortunate to find one they still
 
01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
are not at
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
resolution and it's about finding a
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
solution um but also about doing it
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
without this Silo approach of this is
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
your fault this is your fault we we
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
actually want to get something effective
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
done um I have a student who through the
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
process we discovered that placing her
 
01:14:00.629 --> 01:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
through a best interest
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
process um was a better option for her
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
as a student it actually saved the
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
school district twice as much money and
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's a better result she's doing well
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I hope to attend her
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
graduation what where we're really
 
01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
struggling is we just cannot get to
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
people fast enough and with all those
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
timelines ticking it it's very difficult
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I I also have you know dcyf workers
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
reaching out to me because they've heard
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
hey you guys solved this impossible
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
thing and these are the the same
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
children that that are you know being
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
placed out of state to the tune of a
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
half a million dollar a year or more um
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
and so one of our big pieces is to
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
really look at can we get those kids
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
into the appropriate level of
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment education
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
there are kids that go to
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
treatment places that could be attending
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
public schools at much less cost to
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
everyone and frankly they're now not
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
being put in a more restrictive
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
environment than they need which we know
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
isn't good for them so that's it's a
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
holistic approach um I I I literally got
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
a call from a student services director
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
at a school district for my assistance
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
in one of their cases to just be there
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
for the parent and they're they're on
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
opposing sides but she thought that our
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
office could bring some reassurance to
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
the parent and a solution so it it's
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
refreshing for me as somebody who's been
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
in state service a long time to really
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
be working on how do we solve this the
 
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.390 align:start position:0%
be working on how do we solve this the
frustration

01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
is you know I'm in six counties I'm I'm
 
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.270 align:start position:0%
is you know I'm in six counties I'm I'm
one

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
person can't be every where
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
representative EV and followed by
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
represent mon you know the The Squeeze
 
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
is really General funds so have you
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
folks thought creatively about other
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
sources of funds for your program I'll
 
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
let you answer that tough question so uh
 
01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
it it definitely has been suggested um
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
that there are probably some grants we
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
could look at um at the federal level
 
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I would tell you again the question
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
is really
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
just who you know a lot of agencies have
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
a Grant Management person a grant writer
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
um so so on some level we are just in a
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
catch 22
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
of how do we do the work with two of us
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
um that is a pretty pretty wide
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
statutory mandate certainly it's
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
something we could fit into someone's
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
job description if we can have a few
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
more stuff right so then just to
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
understand the the ask here a little bit
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
better I was trying to figure out what
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
it would cost for the you were asking
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
for three three more three additional we
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
initially in prioritized needs had four
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
additional cut that down knowing that
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's um a very slim budget season and I
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
understand that everyone has said you
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
can't ask for any more than you have
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
budgeted and I said that's well and good
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
except that we cannot do and I think
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's incumbent on me to say we
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
can't do the work that the statute is
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
asking us to do with two of us so three
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
more people um
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
you know the we took numbers from
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
HR um you know from agencies and and
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
basically I think it built up to
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 725 and 750,000 your
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
hand out right and I think we said 750
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of that it
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
says so you you'd be asking for 740
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
instead of what you've asked for or in
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
addition um we asked for in the
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
prioritizes needs something that was
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
around 850 50,000 so I'm saying we
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
dropped a position and benefits Etc from
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
740 right so am I reading this right
 
01:18:09.639 --> 01:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
740 right so am I reading this right
it's

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
395 yeah this budget was built without
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
any you know before the agency existed
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
without any input um and at some point
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
the number floated back in 2020 to 2021
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
was 500,000
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's not you know what it got funded
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
at before we existed so yes it's a huge
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
mismatch between you know taking the
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
budget that we were
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
given um with a a slight really
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
basically just salary step increases is
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
all that does um and saying that that
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
was never an adequate budget again we
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
are not asking for Data Systems we are
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
not ask we're we're not asking for
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
anything but a few staff to try to
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
accomplish what it's being asked I I
 
01:18:58.629 --> 01:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
don't see any rent here do you how do
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
you have space so we do have space we
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
have three um rooms in Johnson Hall okay
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and it it should there there was a
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
rent line item in there exactly exactly
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
and that's actually High to be honest
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
with you in terms of what we're being
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
build right now like I said we have
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
three rooms in a one of our older
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
buildings um it is adequate we're not
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
asking for more we would figure out how
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
to trade off um
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know with that stuff but right all
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
right and let me ask I mean since this
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
is the two of you what is your um term
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
in this job is it a threee or is it so
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
mine was five year five years um okay so
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
I am a little more than a year and a
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
half into
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
that okay and and why are you um a
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
temporary and not a a regular full-time
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
class of I I don't know
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
um I have about 15 years of State
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
service so they they they told me that
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't change so this is temporary with
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
Benefits though right correct yes yeah I
 
01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
I I essentially laterally transferred
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
over I see from DHHS so Jack can we find
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
out if he we made him
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
permanent classified would it how would
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
it affect the budget yeah because it
 
01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
that seems kind of weird to me all right
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I have three
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
areas I want to look into and I did
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
watch the live stream last week so I
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for that um how could
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
would you describe um the work you do
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
compared with the parent information
 
01:20:41.239 --> 01:20:42.910 align:start position:0%
compared with the parent information
center

01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
um I would say the parent information
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
center is a very limited first um option
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
for parents to just learn what it means
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know what rights they have if they
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
have a child with a disability
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe a basic overview of the IEP
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
process they have sample forms we're not
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
trying to duplicate any of that it was
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest things I did when I
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
came into the role I said there seem to
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
be a lot of people working in disability
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
we do not want to be duplicating what
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
someone else is doing um so we would
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
refer people to for sample forms and
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing to the parent
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
Information Center website um they do
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
not go to I AP meetings they are not
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
sort of the find a solution to the
 
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
disagreement or the child out of school
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
or the child
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
institutionalized um they're not doing
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
that at all and their trainings fall
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
short of actual the the actual dispute
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
resolution process um whereas we Dive
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
Right In there when we need to um but we
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
also are doing
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
um you know I it's really just a Case
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
Case Management case resolution piece
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
that gives us a lot more insight I think
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
through the field work um to school
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
districts across the state what they're
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
facing um what parents are fighting we
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
are good at getting to what the meat of
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
the question is that can actually be
 
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
decided as opposed to all of the emotion
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
around I you know situations of students
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
with disabilities okay and um another do
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
you think the number of cases that come
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
to your office would be reduced if the
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
specialed directors in local districts
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
had more training or experience in
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
managing special
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
education and and I'll I'll preface this
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
by saying I I was on a school board for
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
nine years and sometimes I see the um
 
01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
the number of disputes regarding special
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
education seem to track with the uh
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
experience or inexperience level of the
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
director um I was just wondering if
 
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
there was does your
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
office um invest in professional
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
development of people who are special
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
education professionals you know program
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
directors to ensure that resolution can
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
be attained at the lowest level as
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
possible without elevating it so it's a
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
great question um we certainly don't
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
have really a budget for professional
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
development but we we do spend staff
 
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
time um Tim and I have both done a
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
number of uh New Hampshire Association
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
of special ed administrator trainings um
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
what he alluded to with the placements
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
when it's by courts or for treatment
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
episodes and and where the school
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
districts should participate in that
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
process is a training he did for special
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
ed administrators um I've done some
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to roll out even
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
more uh I'm not sure that the number of
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
cases coming to our office would be
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
reduced because really when we're
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
talking about trying to have staff to
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
manage a like and bring to resolution
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 300 a year that is 1%
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the Statewide I'm not sure we're
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
going to get that number much lower okay
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
but we certainly are interested in the
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
training piece for parents for Advocates
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
and for special ed administrators and I
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
have one one more sorry Chris um the
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is there are two young men I
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
know personally who entered educa you
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
know entered the school system
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
really without any uh one in fact one
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
fellow and I spoke on the floor of this
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
I did a unanimous consent a couple years
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
ago his parents were told that he would
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
never speak never be able to be potty
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
trained and he graduated from college
 
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
he's got a great job now in um something
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
to do with computers computer uh video
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
design I think and so he's a he's a
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
taxpaying contributing member of society
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering is there any uh way
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
or any attempt to track that kind of
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
thing because it really does show a
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
return on investment when you look at
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
the money that was invested in this
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
young man's special
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
education it's I'm sure he's paying a
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
lot of that back now in at least income
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
tax so the individuals with disabilities
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
and Education Act does require states to
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
report out on indicators and you're
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
really getting at what you know
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
indicator 1314
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
um they have a handful of them um that
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
talk about the uh next step for people
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
coming out of the special education
 
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
system and and it is precisely getting
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
it are we are we trading it as an
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
investment uh doe New Hampshire doe
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
would tell you again we there's we don't
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
have robust responses in terms of
 
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
numbers on those indicators so while
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
there is data and you can look at New
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's indicators for performance
 
01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
and they look decent um it's not built
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
on a very large sample so again it goes
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
back to this data question we really we
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
need better data across the state for
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
special education um and and people are
 
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the nitty-gritty of how to
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish that but there are indicators
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
that are supposed to measure precisely
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
that it's just that we need a more
 
01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
robust sample of students we are
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
certainly looking at it in our cases and
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
saying we need outcomes that I mean it
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
could range from those were the most
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
severe disabilities it could be they are
 
01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
able to participate in an adult Day
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
program you know through developmental
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
disability waivers rather than being
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
institutionalized right that could be
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
the the positive outcome for the most um
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
severe or we actually engaged voke rehab
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
early on we got this student on a job
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
path even though they were not on a path
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
to complete a high school diploma I'm
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
definitely focused and it'll be part of
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
my conversation today on look at those
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
students who are on certificate of
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
completion paths those are not students
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
going on to a next level of education so
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
we need to be right in there in that 18
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
to 22 age 16 to 22
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
saying let's make sure voke rehab is
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
actually there for them and I think
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
there are some changes to that voke
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
rehab system that you know tweaks that
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
could get more of those students
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
involved okay thank you very much
 
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:18.910 align:start position:0%
involved okay thank you very much
represent

01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
months thank you Mr chairman and um my
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
apologies for coming in late I was uh
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
stuck in a phone tree with my health
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
plan um um and I can just say as the you
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
know the father of a of a of a as I said
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
a young man with a developmental
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
disability he never would have been able
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
to get through high school had it not
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
been for the support he received from
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
the special education department so I
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm very um supportive of the
 
01:27:49.109 --> 01:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
work that you're doing um I just want to
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
try to make sure I understand you know
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
kind of where you are now and and and
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
what what you're requesting um so if I
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
understand correctly right now you've
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
got you've got two two staff for some
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
reason one of you is temporary and the
 
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
other one's full-time but you've got two
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
staff um what I'm hearing you say and
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
what you've put in writing is that um
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
with that two staff you cannot fulfill
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
the the the the obligations that we the
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
legislature and our great wisdom have
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
imposed on you um and you're looking
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
looking to hire an additional four staff
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
right now at this point so that was my
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
initial request when we did prioritize
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
needs um we've we've peeled that back to
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
three okay um really looking at two more
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
case managers um who would probably
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
directly report to Tim um and and Tim
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
and I work very collaboratively together
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
talking about cases and and and
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
direction I do handle some myself um the
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
first year I handled all 40 or 50 that
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
we resolved myself so pretty close to
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
them uh so two more case managers and
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
then we would like to take a position
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
that's currently funded at um one day a
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
week uh and combine that with sort of
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
intake Data Tracking because those are
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
related right when we bring in a case
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
getting the data and following through
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
the resolution assigning that Etc um and
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh policy policy initiative tracking to
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
say okay with what what's coming in the
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
door what could we say um and and I that
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
would be a report directly to me so the
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
data policy and then two more case
 
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
managers is what we're looking for it's
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
three people so so if you got your wish
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
list you would end up with five a total
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
total of five staff and presumably Tim
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
would become
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
permanent okay correct all right
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank just to to go back I feel like I'm
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
being dense here but what you're
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
actually asking for would you recognize
 
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.109 align:start position:0%
actually asking for would you recognize
me

01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
740,000 a year is what you're looking
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
for that is correct okay thank you sorry
 
01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
I interjected all right um yeah I
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
haven't read uh RSA 186c yet but is
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
your you're not really judicial in the
 
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
sense that you have power to decide
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
cases right you're more of a a
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
negotiator or something right
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
to to to try to get people to see things
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh to get them together just by
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
persuasion is is that right with a with
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
a tweak to it uh so here is what I would
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
say the majority of our cases 90% of
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
them yes that's what we're doing we're
 
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
doing it um you know walk softly and
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
carry a big stick uh our statute does
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
say that we should ensure that IEP
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
services are being delivered to students
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
so uh we do get a number of referrals
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
quite a few from the Department of Ed in
 
01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
their dispute resolution and um State
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
complaint process because what they're
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
looking for it's their hearing officers
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
who are the judicial quasi judicial
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
authorities making decisions they are
 
01:31:14.189 --> 01:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
looking for us to become involved in
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
cases with parents sometimes um to say
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
please help get this case to the best
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
statement of the issue to be decided so
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
that our hearing officers can be
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
effective um so uh they will tell a lot
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
of parents reach out to the office of
 
01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.270 align:start position:0%
of parents reach out to the office of
The

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
The
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
Advocate to help you one go to your IP
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
teams and let's see if we can avoid
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution but two hone your
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
case so about 10% of our cases we will
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
join parents um in an advocate role in
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
those hearings before doe do you write
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
an annual report yes we had um a draft
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
of our first one that we actually had a
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
ended up
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
before uh governor sununu and executive
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
Council in a meeting um with that draft
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
they asked some questions asked us to
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
verify some information which I think we
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
have verified so that is true so we'll
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
be re posting that first one kind of in
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
a finalized format yes is the answer
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
soon right yeah soon yeah yeah okay all
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
right um great and my last question is
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
on the budget um there are no funds for
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
instate travel on um on in 2027 so
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's but you do a fair amount of
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
instate travel right you want to answer
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
those question so um I as somebody who's
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
the traveling Road show a lot of times
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh Park and rides are excellent places
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
to work from um the first my my mileage
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
if you will from I live on in in Enfield
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
to conquered is 60 Mi so I wouldn't be
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for that if I were to go
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
because it's within what my daily
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
commute is so we try to do that as much
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
as possible I try to do as much virtual
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
as is
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate um with meeting with school
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
districts and parents but um it all with
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
an eye on so like hey can we keep that
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
cost down eventually it it you know
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'll go to Massachusetts that
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
happened where I had to go on tours of
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
schools but it's hard to say with just
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
two of us that we whether we would need
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
more for travel or not I see but so in
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
20 fiscal year 2024 you weren't part of
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
the agency right so you
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
um I or were you maybe no not in not in
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
FY 2024 your will FY 2025 um he started
 
01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple of weeks before the start
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
of it um I did a fair amount of travel I
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
did the same thing Tim does um would go
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
from home out a certain way as opposed
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
to coming into the office do we need
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
zero budget for travel no we need some
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
budget for instate travel if for being
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
fair to ourselves which often we are
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
probably not um it was not a priority
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
and I think there were a lot of moves
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know uh between my argument for
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs which were hundreds of
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
thousands over where we were and you
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
know right now I don't even know if the
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
budget really adequately pays our
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
salaries or has kind of Step increases
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm getting reports that we're
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
going to go over on some of our salary
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
items um from Daz and I think I I'm not
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
sure what to say right for fiscal year
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
25 right yes no but I just meant I just
 
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
want this to be accurate right so we
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
need a bit there you know um at the
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
moment you know it's it's small enough
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and even with two more case
 
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
managers it's probably small enough
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
dollars because we are not sending
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
people needlessly
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
off everywhere um that it could be
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
reclassed from kind of the you know what
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
is still a very small amount but sort of
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
some general line items we do not buy
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
much if anything all right any further
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lehman followed
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
by representative evil thank you Mr
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm assuming you did the same
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
presentation with the governor or the
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
budget director and I'm just curious why
 
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
she or they didn't support your request
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
um so I I say we we did do the request
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
um in the earlier phase when the uh
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
Governor had the budget hearings um
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
neither Governor snono nor Governor aat
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
were there when we spoke about that we
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
have submitted it a few different times
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is it is just the
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
very tight budget cycle and an agency
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
asking for a budget that's double what
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
it has doesn't fly um we didn't have
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
cuts we had a marginal increase which
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
would just do kind of our step salary
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
increases um beyond that I would say
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
that with the agency being as new as it
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
is um people don't necessarily know well
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
what we do and it that did come out
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
before the governor and executive
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
Council in December when we were
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
discussing um what we do there were a
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about why couldn't we
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
just refer all our cases
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
on to someone else and there were
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
parents who were pretty indignant um
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
we've had quotes from area agencies who
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
say I really hope you all can survive
 
01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
and can continue to do what you're doing
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
because we're referring to you when no
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
one else has gotten it done so I I would
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
say being a new agency it's not well
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
understood what we do is my best answer
 
01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:45.870 align:start position:0%
understood what we do is my best answer
represent

01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
V thank you um would you say that if you
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
were better funded new Hampshire's
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
special education dollars would be more
 
01:36:57.679 --> 01:37:03.030 align:start position:0%
special education dollars would be more
effectively

01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
spent I hope so I think I would say that
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think we um are about to invest a
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
large amount of money in special
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
education I saw the number and and
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
having um oversight there and looking
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
for efficiencies where it's possible
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
can't do anything but help
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay we we've been collaborative with
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed um whereas some
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
agencies who are who are independent and
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
in somewhat of an oversight position are
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
not collaborative with with those
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that maybe they're doing
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
oversight we've also been collaborative
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
with school districts so I think people
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
trust us to say look we we have to look
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
at efficiency as well as looking at
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
what's best for an individual case we're
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
representing and we're committed to
 
01:37:52.109 --> 01:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
doing that we've been asked um to
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
participate both in labor costing
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
efforts and building out Data Systems
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
within doe and we've been asked to
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
participate in a suggested I don't know
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
if it will go through but uh um right
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
now I believe there's going to be a
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
build this session about um commissions
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
to study the costs of special education
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
and various Solutions and and we've been
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
listed in that and so I think that
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
people trust us to try to be conscious
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
of the efficiency of dollars and then
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
the other one I I'm wandering into
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
terrain I'm not familiar with and I hope
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
don't get struck by lightning by asking
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
this question but is it conceivable that
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
your group could be paid for through the
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or does that give
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
jeebies yeah well okay so I'll answer
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
this question because basically from the
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
point of view of the budget there is no
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
difference right so so there's no
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
practical difference doing one way or
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
the other um I think in general we're
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
trying to keep the keep the education
 
01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
trust fund for adequate Ed and take out
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
all of the this that and the other thing
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
that's that has been in there in the
 
01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.159 align:start position:0%
past is is that right representative W
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so the answer is probably not
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
but but but at the end of the day it it
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter when you know
 
01:39:18.189 --> 01:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
one's the left pocket and the other's
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
the right pocket kind of thing I guess
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
that's right it's just that one is very
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
restricted and the other can be used
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
okay in many ways so that's why I asked
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
the question but if I could add anything
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
to that even as the special education
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
Advocate I am concerned with I'm very
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
interested to see what happens with
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
funding bills with the education trust
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
fund Etc because I don't want to see um
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
the tensions that currently exist
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
between special education and general
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
education one of the efficiencies that
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
I've suggested is that we really need to
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
look at you know the 25,000 or so out of
 
01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
the 32,00 population and
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
say are some can some of those be on
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
IEPs for short periods of time and then
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
come off to the multi-tiered systems of
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
support obviously less restrictive that
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
should be there in gen Ed but if we're
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
making trade-offs between special
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
education and general education at the
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
local levels they're more likely not to
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
have the same level of multi-tiered
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
systems of support that benefit all
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
students so I don't I don't want to see
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
those trade-offs I want to see what we
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
can do to get to a better place than
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
where we are right now in that okay all
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much for
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
coming I I really appreciate it um we'll
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
let you go back to your case loan thank
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah so for the committee um so
 
01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back and be with the
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
treasure at
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
115 um after that I'd like to you know
 
01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have seen everybody basically so I
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
want to uh hand out some things and talk
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
about the big picture and then I wanted
 
01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
to spend if we if I don't know what if
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney is coming back
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to spend the rest of the
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon in caucus and and sort of talk
 
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
about um kind of where we're going and
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
our targets and things like that so um
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my plan for the rest of
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
the today any questions no no we're
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:52.229 align:start position:0%

Mell
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I know our whole discussion was
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
kind of cut cut off last time and we
 
03:16:40.349 --> 03:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
have a couple people back that weren't
 
03:16:43.429 --> 03:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
here so um good
 
03:16:46.990 --> 03:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon good so uh we already asked
 
03:16:49.469 --> 03:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
about on this page you you're adding a
 
03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
person so that's uh an entry-level
 
03:16:58.630 --> 03:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.640 --> 03:17:00.990 align:start position:0%
 
152

03:17:00.990 --> 03:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
152
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
um and oh how about vacancies do we ask
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
about that there aren't any I think I do
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
not have vacancies right now yeah okay
 
03:17:15.189 --> 03:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
hope hope it stays
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:23.469 --> 03:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
okay and we asked
 
03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
about what happened to other funds in
 
03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
25 and I don't
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
remember what was the answer to that one
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
oh the funds Rel relative to on page
 
03:17:42.189 --> 03:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
152 expenditure total for the treasury
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
Department right everything looks sort
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
of normal except for fiscal year
 
03:17:50.830 --> 03:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
right because other funds went from 160
 
03:17:53.830 --> 03:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
to 30 oh that was it the um rooms of
 
03:17:56.189 --> 03:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
meals wasn't correct budgeted it wasn't
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
part of the budget now it is and now
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's back again it's back yes but it was
 
03:18:03.269 --> 03:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
part for part of the year or part of the
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
bium or something yeah it wasn't
 
03:18:08.189 --> 03:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
included in the budget initially but the
 
03:18:11.389 --> 03:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
expenditures um were recorded in the
 
03:18:13.950 --> 03:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit where the activity
 
03:18:16.269 --> 03:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
happens it's just it wasn't in the in
 
03:18:16.279 --> 03:18:17.429 align:start position:0%
happens it's just it wasn't in the in
the

03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:18:18.990 --> 03:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
um original bad budget I see what you're
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
saying so if I looked at what we passed
 
03:18:24.110 --> 03:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
two years ago it would have had 35 comma
 
03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
35 or something like that is that right
 
03:18:30.189 --> 03:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
but when it became actual now there's
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
the number there correct yeah yeah yeah
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
I see okay
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
good okay so that explained that
 
03:18:38.239 --> 03:18:40.150 align:start position:0%
good okay so that explained that
one

03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:18:42.510 --> 03:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
um page
 
03:18:55.950 --> 03:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:55.960 --> 03:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:18:57.160 --> 03:18:57.170 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:18:57.170 --> 03:18:59.710 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

03:18:59.710 --> 03:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:19:03.229 --> 03:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
so this accounting
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
un right so you move people around I
 
03:19:08.189 --> 03:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
guess this this accounting unit is
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
getting four more people from somewhere
 
03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
else that is correct we we moved them
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
from other Divi other divisions so they
 
03:19:16.199 --> 03:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
from other Divi other divisions so they
can

03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
um reconcil in the unit reconciliation
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
unit in anticipation of the changes that
 
03:19:24.590 --> 03:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
are coming with the accounting
 
03:19:27.630 --> 03:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
system right okay
 
03:19:27.640 --> 03:19:30.830 align:start position:0%
system right okay
good

03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
um okay we talked a bit
 
03:19:43.710 --> 03:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
that is an amount that is typically not
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's that's not
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
budgeted because we don't know how much
 
03:19:57.150 --> 03:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to return but those are
 
03:19:59.590 --> 03:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
funds that come from the general fund uh
 
03:20:03.150 --> 03:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
because we always um we always will will
 
03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
return property um even after the funds
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
are cheated to the general fund okay
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
so is this the one we had the question
 
03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
of whether um Ways and Means numbers for
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
the general fund had this income and
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
this expense it is but so so the activ
 
03:20:27.550 --> 03:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
the cheated U portion what we return the
 
03:20:30.150 --> 03:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
property we return gets recorded there
 
03:20:31.710 --> 03:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
but your question I think it was
 
03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
relative to um some expenditures that
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
happen in the abandom property Division
 
03:20:40.030 --> 03:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
and that was related to the uh external
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
audits that we do to um uh the
 
03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
Multistate audits um we have contracts
 
03:20:46.040 --> 03:20:47.150 align:start position:0%
Multistate audits um we have contracts
with

03:20:47.150 --> 03:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh firms that go out that go out and do
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
Multistate Audits and we have budgeted
 
03:20:54.750 --> 03:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
an amount that you were trying to see if
 
03:20:57.790 --> 03:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
that was um oh yeah uh an amount page
 
03:21:02.189 --> 03:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
147 I think 147 that's correct and um we
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
looked at so we typically budget a a an
 
03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
amount that is going to allow us to pay
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
um we don't know how many of those firms
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
are going to come back and say well we
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
we found all this property um and once
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
they remit that property to us is when
 
03:21:21.309 --> 03:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
we pay them about 10% of of that a
 
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
contingency fee um so we we usually
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
budget an amand that will allow us we
 
03:21:27.630 --> 03:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how much that's going to be
 
03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we looked at some history and there
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
were years that we pay 700,000 less than
 
03:21:36.429 --> 03:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
that um so we typically just we we like
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
to have a a a number that we don't have
 
03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal in case we we we have to
 
03:21:44.429 --> 03:21:44.439 align:start position:0%
pay that um what I will say what I will
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
add to that is regardless of how much we
 
03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
budget here whatever we spend the actual
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
is what gets um taken from this
 
03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
achievment the G to J fund so and and
 
03:21:58.750 --> 03:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
the ex the estimate that we provide to
 
03:22:03.110 --> 03:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
way and means has other variables um so
 
03:22:05.189 --> 03:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
so it really won't impact the revenue
 
03:22:06.990 --> 03:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
number even if we change this number
 
03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
here I see what we're talking about by
 
03:22:12.030 --> 03:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
the way just for everybody else is on
 
03:22:15.189 --> 03:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
page 147 the very first number the
 
03:22:17.150 --> 03:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
current expense
 
03:22:18.189 --> 03:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
why so yes so you notice the actual is
 
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
500,000 but but the budgeted amount is
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
1.5 million and so but what she's saying
 
03:22:33.389 --> 03:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
is that will become an actual at some
 
03:22:37.510 --> 03:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
point and it's all figured in because
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
basically um you have this expense of
 
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
this 500,000 you have the expense of the
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
4 and a half million on page 140 so
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's a total expense of this thing of
 
03:22:55.950 --> 03:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
five million but the amount of property
 
03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
that gets abandoned is like 24 million
 
03:23:02.710 --> 03:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
or something so what actually ends up in
 
03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
the general fund is is1 million or
 
03:23:07.510 --> 03:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
something like that right that is
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
correct okay and but it's all included
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
in what we already know from or it's
 
03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
estimated in what we know from ways of
 
03:23:16.040 --> 03:23:17.269 align:start position:0%
estimated in what we know from ways of
means

03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
means
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing nothing to see here I
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
guess is no unfortunately I don't I
 
03:23:25.590 --> 03:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any anything else to to to
 
03:23:27.189 --> 03:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
change that estimate the revenue
 
03:23:29.070 --> 03:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
estimate is is what we expect and
 
03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's what we get right quick
 
03:23:33.150 --> 03:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
quick question go ahead r% of months
 
03:23:35.110 --> 03:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thanks for coming in I'm
 
03:23:36.630 --> 03:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I missed your presentation last
 
03:23:37.870 --> 03:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
week so I'm playing a little bit of
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
catchup sure um so did I hear correctly
 
03:23:43.389 --> 03:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
that we that we have $24 million a year
 
03:23:46.269 --> 03:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
of abandoned property Revenue that comes
 
03:23:48.750 --> 03:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
in into the general fund so it has been
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
increasing over the last few years but I
 
03:23:53.389 --> 03:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
will say about 20 million we collect um
 
03:23:55.189 --> 03:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
again has been increasing so last over
 
03:23:56.910 --> 03:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
the last few years we have we have
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
collected about 23 24 million we try to
 
03:24:02.110 --> 03:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
return as much as we can so last year
 
03:24:04.990 --> 03:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
was a high year we returned 12 million
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
um and this year I think we're we're not
 
03:24:09.630 --> 03:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
we're not as high but again we Tred to
 
03:24:11.309 --> 03:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
return so whatever we don't return after
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
3 years um and we pay our expenditures
 
03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
here our expenses we we we Che to the
 
03:24:18.750 --> 03:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
general fund so that becomes un
 
03:24:20.590 --> 03:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive Revenue to the general fund
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
I think I think you answered one of my
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions then was because I see the ads
 
03:24:25.830 --> 03:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
that are running on TV now about you
 
03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
know abandoned property which I need to
 
03:24:32.590 --> 03:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
follow up on myself sure um but um so
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
the only money that goes back to the
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
general fund is money that has kind of
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
gone through that threeyear kind of
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
waiting period if you will that is
 
03:24:43.110 --> 03:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
correct so so that's what the law says
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't if we're don't return after
 
03:24:47.830 --> 03:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
three years we has cheated however um
 
03:24:49.550 --> 03:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
the owners of the property can come back
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
at any time and that's the other line
 
03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you see um on page I can't remember
 
03:24:56.309 --> 03:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
what page it was but that's the amount
 
03:25:00.670 --> 03:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
that we have returned after um after we
 
03:25:02.469 --> 03:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
ex cheated those funds to to the general
 
03:25:04.990 --> 03:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
fund so a a property owner can always
 
03:25:07.150 --> 03:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
come back to us and collect their funds
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
which which line is is that the the 1.5
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
million or is that the 4
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
million that is um is cheetah property
 
03:25:24.189 --> 03:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.750 --> 03:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
maybe Sly yes
 
03:25:36.389 --> 03:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
140 so last year we returned 4.4 million
 
03:25:41.469 --> 03:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
this 24 you don't see anything in 25 but
 
03:25:44.309 --> 03:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
um I think we have um I think we have
 
03:25:46.510 --> 03:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
returned about 2 million this year
 
03:25:50.830 --> 03:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
something around that yeah um yes uh
 
03:25:53.389 --> 03:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative Ron quick question thank
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
you so much um for coming and I am sorry
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
I missed your presentation last week but
 
03:26:01.309 --> 03:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
I I know in the um the union leader
 
03:26:03.990 --> 03:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
prints that all the aband what other
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
ways do we reach out to the public to
 
03:26:08.590 --> 03:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
see if just to let them know that there
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
may be abandoned property so that's what
 
03:26:12.830 --> 03:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's one way and that's in the law we
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
have we we we publish um the list and un
 
03:26:17.790 --> 03:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
leader all of the pro all of the new
 
03:26:20.070 --> 03:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
properties that we collect that's that's
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the list that that you see on the unit
 
03:26:24.349 --> 03:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
leader so the other way we do this so we
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
just tried that um that ad for the first
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
time we wanted to try it we we never
 
03:26:31.150 --> 03:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
really had the bandwidth of the of the
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
staff to be able to um to do that but we
 
03:26:35.710 --> 03:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
tried that this year that was it it
 
03:26:37.469 --> 03:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
looks like it's successful we wanted to
 
03:26:40.830 --> 03:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
start low not you know not to um we
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to just again try it but the
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
other way we do it is we do our reach
 
03:26:47.710 --> 03:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
events we try to um um we ask uh
 
03:26:49.309 --> 03:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
organizations if they can invite us for
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
the day and so we go and we we we go for
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
the day we just attended a nursing home
 
03:26:56.590 --> 03:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
in ASA um so different places to to try
 
03:26:59.189 --> 03:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
to return those funds um at the national
 
03:27:00.750 --> 03:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
level the the organizations that we
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
belong to the um National um National
 
03:27:06.229 --> 03:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
Association of State treasurers that
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
help us at the national level so we've
 
03:27:11.469 --> 03:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
had um we've had um whenever good
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
morning in America talks about abandoned
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
property then we get this all of this
 
03:27:18.030 --> 03:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
new Quest so um so there are different
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
ways that we try to return it but again
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to explore a few more of
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
those options to try to return it uh
 
03:27:25.950 --> 03:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
year yes do you list it on your website
 
03:27:31.269 --> 03:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
as well yes it's okay it's all there
 
03:27:32.910 --> 03:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
it's all on the website yes do you know
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
how many let's say from the union lyrics
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
that must be pretty costly to run that
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
print and what what is the cost and how
 
03:27:42.990 --> 03:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
many uh inquiries do you get from that
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
do you believe it's cost effective it is
 
03:27:47.670 --> 03:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
expensive there is no doubt I mean um it
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
isn't the law that's the reason we we we
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
do it uh it needs to be a publication
 
03:27:55.830 --> 03:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
that um with Statewide circulation so
 
03:27:59.950 --> 03:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's a union leader um we we I haven't
 
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
tried to change that just because it is
 
03:28:05.550 --> 03:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
again that's that all of the states do
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
it that way but also we're just trying
 
03:28:10.510 --> 03:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
to increase the reach um and different
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
ways um is it cause effective I I just I
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to take the business from the
 
03:28:18.030 --> 03:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
leader yet there's I think we can find
 
03:28:20.110 --> 03:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
all the ways and and again we we
 
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
continue to collect more property every
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
year um and so I think we just need to
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
um again continue that effort chair can
 
03:28:30.189 --> 03:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
I just follow up on that question um so
 
03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
where where in the budget is is the are
 
03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
those expenses the uh expenses for the
 
03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
ads in the union leader yes so that's
 
03:28:39.199 --> 03:28:43.110 align:start position:0%
ads in the union leader yes so that's
that's

03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:46.910 --> 03:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
um this again as some patient one
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'm lost
 
03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
47 yes so um the activ all of the
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
expenses of the division the V and
 
03:29:01.469 --> 03:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
property division at start in um on page
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
48 so it will be um Publications will be
 
03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:23.830 --> 03:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
oh no it is it is 20 it will be in CL 20
 
03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:26.070 align:start position:0%
oh no it is it is 20 it will be in CL 20
current

03:29:26.070 --> 03:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:29:30.150 --> 03:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
expenses so so and I'm sure that that
 
03:29:32.189 --> 03:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
that that cost center probably includes
 
03:29:34.910 --> 03:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
some other items in addition to the the
 
03:29:36.670 --> 03:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
current expenses includes the majority
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
of the money is um is what we pay to the
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
the firms the AUD firms that I was
 
03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
mentioning we have contracts with them
 
03:29:47.469 --> 03:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
we have we have about 10 contracts so
 
03:29:49.309 --> 03:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
essentially we do we do business with
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
all of the other firms that um are in
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
that industry yep just so we can uh
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
collect as much property as possible
 
03:29:58.990 --> 03:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get a handle on is
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
the the the amount that's actually being
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
spent or budgeted for placing ads in the
 
03:30:10.389 --> 03:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
paper do you Rec or 30,000 how much 25
 
03:30:12.189 --> 03:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
or 30,000 I was hoping there'd be a few
 
03:30:12.199 --> 03:30:13.309 align:start position:0%
or 30,000 I was hoping there'd be a few
more

03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:30:17.950 --> 03:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
and I can we can confirm that amount
 
03:30:23.189 --> 03:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
still significant okay um yeah and just
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
interest this abandoned property it
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't just sit here for three years
 
03:30:31.510 --> 03:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's already sat you know in some
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
broker's account or something for 10
 
03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
years or something like that and then we
 
03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
get it and then we sit on it another a
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
some number of years right
 
03:30:44.469 --> 03:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
so this is not you know
 
03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
anyway it it comes it's been sitting for
 
03:30:49.870 --> 03:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
a long period of time okay and that's
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
why so many people don't come back and
 
03:30:54.750 --> 03:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
get it because maybe they're not around
 
03:30:58.950 --> 03:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
all right so page 144 I just
 
03:31:02.910 --> 03:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess we asked about um the
 
03:31:07.950 --> 03:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
university so so we pay debt back and
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's there it's it's in a number of
 
03:31:14.590 --> 03:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
different groups so our main debt
 
03:31:14.600 --> 03:31:16.189 align:start position:0%
different groups so our main debt
payments

03:31:16.189 --> 03:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
payments
 
03:31:18.990 --> 03:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
um are on page
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
143 um Debt Service right
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
um looks like
 
03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh going up to 68 million in 20 do we
 
03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
ask why oh um you said the reason
 
03:31:40.750 --> 03:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
that um fiscal year 26 and 27 or so
 
03:31:43.469 --> 03:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
different was the prison is that that is
 
03:31:46.590 --> 03:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
correct and I recalculated that um The
 
03:31:50.670 --> 03:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
Debt Service for for that fiscal year so
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
I had an opportunity to speak with um
 
03:31:54.110 --> 03:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner departmental
 
03:31:57.670 --> 03:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
Corrections and um again we're not
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
planning on bonding it this year so
 
03:32:00.870 --> 03:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's why you don't see it in FIS year
 
03:32:03.550 --> 03:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
26 The Debt Service but um but there's
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
an expectation that they're spending the
 
03:32:08.429 --> 03:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
money over the next um couple of years
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
so we will be bonding that amount what I
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
was able to confirm with the
 
03:32:15.189 --> 03:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner is that they'll spend the
 
03:32:16.750 --> 03:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
40 million
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
not at once they'll spend it over time
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
over the period of two years so with
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
that information what I did is I
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
recalculated that Debt Service assuming
 
03:32:26.670 --> 03:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
that we will issue 20 million and 20
 
03:32:28.750 --> 03:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
million in two different years rather
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
than one so I have those numbers um that
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
I can provide dlba if you um I believe
 
03:32:37.630 --> 03:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
that would be more a more accurate Debt
 
03:32:41.269 --> 03:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
Service to use uh and that way 27 won't
 
03:32:45.150 --> 03:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
be as High um but 28 will be higher or
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
is it oh yes future years will be higher
 
03:32:47.600 --> 03:32:48.790 align:start position:0%
is it oh yes future years will be higher
for

03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
TR okay good I have that information so
 
03:32:57.670 --> 03:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah but 26 won't change 26 won't change
 
03:32:58.910 --> 03:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
so why was
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
26 oh so 25 adjusted authorized may not
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
be accurate either right it might end up
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
being less
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
than fiscal the current fiscal
 
03:33:10.680 --> 03:33:14.349 align:start position:0%
than fiscal the current fiscal
year

03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
um this should be accurate the 60 64 and
 
03:33:18.239 --> 03:33:19.349 align:start position:0%
um this should be accurate the 60 64 and
a

03:33:19.349 --> 03:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:33:19.359 --> 03:33:20.910 align:start position:0%
a
half

03:33:20.910 --> 03:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
half
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
yes okay so why is the surrounding year
 
03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:25.790 align:start position:0%
yes okay so why is the surrounding year
is

03:33:25.790 --> 03:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
less what made that year high I'm 143
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
14 you see where it says Debt
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
Service so for the most part Debt
 
03:33:40.189 --> 03:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
Service declines we we we pay more than
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
what we borrow but there are times that
 
03:33:45.910 --> 03:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
those N I can't remember if there was
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
anything in particular that made that um
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
budget number higher however if we
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
didn't spend all the 64 which is very po
 
03:33:56.349 --> 03:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
I think we have an expectation we will
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
lapse do you recall that amount I don't
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay we can get that number but it's not
 
03:34:02.590 --> 03:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be the 64 million
 
03:34:06.309 --> 03:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
total we're going to lapse an amount um
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
60 fisc year
 
03:34:09.120 --> 03:34:14.030 align:start position:0%
60 fisc year
26

03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
um we include assumtion assumption that
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
we're bonding so when we start bonding
 
03:34:22.990 --> 03:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
you you you see the debt the the debt
 
03:34:25.590 --> 03:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
Services reflected the following year so
 
03:34:28.269 --> 03:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
in 26 we so for example this year we're
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to bond approximately 16 million
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why the The Debt Service in
 
03:34:37.870 --> 03:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
26 is lower in 27 we're increasing The
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
Debt Service we are we are assuming
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to issue more bonds and just
 
03:34:45.229 --> 03:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
simply because even the capital budget
 
03:34:48.110 --> 03:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
right now has uh uh um the governor's
 
03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
proposal includes 140 million for the
 
03:34:52.990 --> 03:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
bium so that alone is 70 million each
 
03:34:55.229 --> 03:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
year and then we're adding the 20
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
million so that number is going to uh be
 
03:35:00.990 --> 03:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
what I have here is that it's going to
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
be 66 million
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
66.9 rather than 68 that you see here I
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
actually heard from the chair of Public
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
Works and he thinks they're not going to
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
do more than 120 five okay so you know
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
that might come down again a little bit
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
so again what we don't spend we lapse
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
and typically it
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
in for the most part that that's a
 
03:35:29.590 --> 03:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's a number we use but sometimes we
 
03:35:32.590 --> 03:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
we don't end up issuing the 60 million
 
03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's just an estimate it's just over the
 
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
years that's that's about the average 60
 
03:35:40.830 --> 03:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
million in bonds but again we Bond based
 
03:35:42.590 --> 03:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
on the expenditure so if the agencies
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
are not spending fast enough we don't
 
03:35:46.750 --> 03:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
have to bond the entire amount so some
 
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's what we end up lapsing
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you uh and again
 
03:35:54.030 --> 03:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
forgive me for uh if I'm asking a
 
03:35:56.110 --> 03:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
question that um may have already been
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
answered um so the just looking at fy2
 
03:36:02.910 --> 03:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
24 the $59
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
million that is The Debt Service on all
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the debt that the state of New
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has outstanding all of or is
 
03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
there is there are there any debts that
 
03:36:15.389 --> 03:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
are kind of off the books yes well
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
there's future there's more pages we're
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
going to get to in a moment so this 59
 
03:36:24.269 --> 03:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
million is is debt paid with General
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
funds so anything that is budgeted and
 
03:36:30.990 --> 03:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
there is not um is not debt that is
 
03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
going to be repay with other revenue for
 
03:36:36.189 --> 03:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
example The Liquor Commission if they if
 
03:36:38.229 --> 03:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
they if they have a project they pay
 
03:36:40.110 --> 03:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
with liquor funds uh so if there are
 
03:36:42.269 --> 03:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
some agencies that have other funds they
 
03:36:45.070 --> 03:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
pay uh they pay their debt with those
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
those funds funds so this number 59
 
03:36:51.910 --> 03:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
million is just um is is debt repay with
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
General funds and where and and if if
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
the if like the liquor uh commission has
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
debt um The Debt Service on that debt
 
03:37:02.349 --> 03:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
does that show up in your budget or show
 
03:37:05.309 --> 03:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
up in their budget their budget there's
 
03:37:07.229 --> 03:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
um so the the other dat that you'll see
 
03:37:10.510 --> 03:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh represent my wi was mentioning is um
 
03:37:13.070 --> 03:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
the university system is another it's
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's separate but it's also paid
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
with General funds the university system
 
03:37:18.510 --> 03:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
and then we have debt the community
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
college system The Debt Service that you
 
03:37:23.429 --> 03:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
see there that is paid by the Community
 
03:37:27.870 --> 03:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
College by the system in school build
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
and Aid is repaid with the meals and
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
rooms um tax so that's considered all
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
the revenue not general fund so you'll
 
03:37:39.429 --> 03:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
see that on the following
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
Pages yeah so go to page we'll Turn the
 
03:37:45.790 --> 03:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
Page to 144
 
03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
so some of our debt is on behalf of the
 
03:37:52.670 --> 03:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
University system and it's just called
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
out for whatever reason in this
 
03:37:57.790 --> 03:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
particular accounting
 
03:38:02.910 --> 03:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
unit um and it these numbers assume that
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
that we're going to borrow roughly $10
 
03:38:06.269 --> 03:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
million a
 
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.630 --> 03:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
them but um anyway and the other and
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
these are all General funds and the
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
other accounting units that you see is
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
again Debt Service for the community C
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
system they're paying their debt it's
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
just because of the way the capital
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
budget was was um adopted that way and
 
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then we also have
 
03:38:37.630 --> 03:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
um School building Aid right so that's
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
interesting School building AIDS
 
03:38:41.790 --> 03:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
straight out of rooms and meals that's
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
how it was uh yes that's how this um
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
this Bonds were were yeah authorized to
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
be repay with a portion of the meals and
 
03:38:54.870 --> 03:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
rs tax okay representative people is
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
that statutory or was that yes yeah
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes but this is probably just the tale
 
03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
of we we haven't given new school
 
03:39:07.630 --> 03:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
building Aid in a while I think that's
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
correct that we have four more years
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
there for of this number but it's uh we
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
have um
 
03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
I say 15 million outstanding I believe
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
just make a comment yes so I was just
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
going to say on the UNH thing I mean
 
03:39:24.590 --> 03:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
Peter's been here sorry Peter longer
 
03:39:26.510 --> 03:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
than any of us but there used to be a
 
03:39:30.750 --> 03:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
keep program for UNH where they were and
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
so maybe what was it like for 10 years
 
03:39:35.870 --> 03:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
or something they were guaranteeing that
 
03:39:38.750 --> 03:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
they were going to add Capital monies
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
for un every banian for to help them
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
catch up so it may be because of the
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
program that they have a separate line I
 
03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't know there's a separate line
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
because at some point the the governor's
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
um the budget office they they wanted to
 
03:39:57.070 --> 03:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
have a separate accounting unit for that
 
03:40:00.110 --> 03:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
to track their Debt Service but but
 
03:40:02.590 --> 03:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
every year um there's there's an
 
03:40:04.830 --> 03:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
authorization for UNH to be repay with
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
General funds so um even this budget the
 
03:40:08.990 --> 03:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
current the governor's budget has a
 
03:40:11.950 --> 03:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
proposal for 10 for 20 million in
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
total right rep representative months
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and let me just preface what I'm
 
03:40:21.309 --> 03:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
going about to say with you know I'm not
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily recommending this but I'm
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of curious um are are there
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
are there opportunities or is there any
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
prevent is there anything
 
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
preventing you us from restructuring the
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
debt to maybe lessen the burden now
 
03:40:42.750 --> 03:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
and and and either either take advantage
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
of lower interest rates which is
 
03:40:45.070 --> 03:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
probably not the case because they're
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
going up but to restructure the debt to
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
to maybe help us in the short term and
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
give us a little bit of breathing room
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
going forward trust me she's already
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
done it thank you for the question um so
 
03:41:03.070 --> 03:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh every time we issue bonds we look at
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
the possibility of doing refunding so if
 
03:41:08.349 --> 03:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
those bonds are cable so after 10 years
 
03:41:10.110 --> 03:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to to to look at
 
03:41:12.189 --> 03:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
those bonds and and if they're callable
 
03:41:14.429 --> 03:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
we look at we look at those bonds to see
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
if there is a possibility to to refund
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
them and because because of lower rates
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
or because the coupons right now are are
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
are again if it's economically
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the state we look at that
 
03:41:28.149 --> 03:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
so we're about to issue bonds and right
 
03:41:30.790 --> 03:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
now we're we're considering to refund in
 
03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
approximately $80 million in bonds those
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
bonds are accable um if the economics
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
work the day of the sale we will proceed
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
with with refunding those bonds if we
 
03:41:44.990 --> 03:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't look that's that's beneficial for
 
03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
the stay we stop and we wait until the
 
03:41:49.710 --> 03:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
next opportunity or we just keep paying
 
03:41:51.269 --> 03:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what we do every time
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
we do analysis of those those bonds that
 
03:41:55.630 --> 03:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
we can try to take advantage of the
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
market conditions go ahead if you were
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
to if you were to re to to to refinance
 
03:42:03.790 --> 03:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
that that 80 million for
 
03:42:06.510 --> 03:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
example and I know it's it's hard to to
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
estimate but is there any do you have
 
03:42:11.710 --> 03:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
any sense at all what that might do in
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
terms of extra cost or well lower cost
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
to the state you know in the in the next
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
two years so so what I can say about the
 
03:42:22.030 --> 03:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
ones that we're looking at right now
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
those 80 million we we bring We'll um
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
right now they they look like they will
 
03:42:29.189 --> 03:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
provide um
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
approximately um like $2 million net
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
present value of savings of $2 million
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
so so we look at so if it's
 
03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
so um Net Present Value so it will be
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
you will see you will see those savings
 
03:42:49.149 --> 03:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
over the um next 10 years but the
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
present value is about 2 million um we
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
typically um the way we we we the way we
 
03:43:00.349 --> 03:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
analyze that if it's going to provide
 
03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
about more than 3% of
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
savings uh of the refunded bonds that's
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
what we think is economically beneficial
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
for the state if it's less than that it
 
03:43:10.950 --> 03:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense the costs are too
 
03:43:12.510 --> 03:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
high and and we can just wait until the
 
03:43:16.349 --> 03:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
next opportunity if there is one
 
03:43:19.910 --> 03:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative evil um Mr chair I
 
03:43:22.510 --> 03:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
did request from the treasurer the debt
 
03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
affordability study and that I forwarded
 
03:43:28.030 --> 03:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
to everybody and I did want to ask just
 
03:43:30.429 --> 03:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
a couple go ah is this appropriate time
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay um well first of all I I wish that
 
03:43:35.040 --> 03:43:35.910 align:start position:0%
okay um well first of all I I wish that
the

03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
finance got copies of this and we could
 
03:43:41.710 --> 03:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about it here
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
because we I know being a public works
 
03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:45.710 align:start position:0%
because we I know being a public works
geek

03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
geek
 
03:43:47.790 --> 03:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh we talked about this at Great length
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget but you know
 
03:43:53.149 --> 03:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
obviously in finance this is where we're
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
seeing the effect of the bonding so I
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
just wondered if I mean it it looks like
 
03:44:04.630 --> 03:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing well in this document um any
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
if you want to say anything on that but
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
I just I guess where I'm going with this
 
03:44:13.870 --> 03:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
is we have um we have the potential
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
liability from the YDC cases there are
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
some other things that might be clouds
 
03:44:23.710 --> 03:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
on the horizon as far as our bond rating
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
and our overall fiscal health and I I
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
just this is such a good snapshot of
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
03:44:34.030 --> 03:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide i' i' kind of like to open it
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
up to you a little bit to let you talk
 
03:44:38.429 --> 03:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
to ask you to discuss this and if you
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
see any um flashing signs of
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
concern thank you representative uh
 
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
just just for your information we we did
 
03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
share the study with I think we we get
 
03:44:53.790 --> 03:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
we we went went distribute that the LBA
 
03:44:55.349 --> 03:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
gets a copy and we post it on the
 
03:44:57.309 --> 03:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
website but I'll be happy to to share it
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
even more I did share what you sent me
 
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes mean we don't talk about he that
 
03:45:05.429 --> 03:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
much sure um so yes you're correct the
 
03:45:08.189 --> 03:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
the study uh shows that the current
 
03:45:09.550 --> 03:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
conditions of the state essentially the
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
Deb profile that we have is is is
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
positive the um the red um the debt to
 
03:45:18.750 --> 03:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
revener ratio which a is a key metric
 
03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we review that's that's
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
3.8% um it has has decreased over time
 
03:45:30.870 --> 03:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
um because of the and that's primarily
 
03:45:33.790 --> 03:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
driven by the revenues the performance
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
of revenues over the last few years so
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's you can still have that you can
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
still see that that the ratio is last
 
03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
year was 4% this year is
 
03:45:46.990 --> 03:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
3.8% um but the key of that is again
 
03:45:50.590 --> 03:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
revenues have have performed but also uh
 
03:45:53.309 --> 03:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
the policies relative to Debt Service to
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
to issue in debt so if we continue to
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
issue debt of approximately 60 million
 
03:46:00.189 --> 03:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
each year again we will continue to
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
issue that and and and and and pay what
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
we and we usually pay um 60% of
 
03:46:10.110 --> 03:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
principle during the first um 10 years
 
03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
and then 40 during the last 10 years
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
what that does is it has is has we we
 
03:46:19.469 --> 03:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
use a rapid U repayment um structure
 
03:46:21.830 --> 03:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
that allows us to continue to have a
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
healthy um debt profile so again all of
 
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
those uh different policies that we have
 
03:46:30.750 --> 03:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
implemented over time the state has
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
implemented over over time um the fact
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
that the legislature stays within the
 
03:46:38.070 --> 03:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
120 million
 
03:46:42.030 --> 03:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
125 million each bium that allows us to
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
to to have a more predictable um
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
um again amount of debt that we have
 
03:46:50.590 --> 03:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
outstanding the revenues are difficult
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
to predict so that's what we like to uh
 
03:46:56.550 --> 03:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
maintain our our our debt in a way that
 
03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
is manageable um so that's what I can
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
essentially that's what this study does
 
03:47:03.149 --> 03:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
and then what we do with this study is
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
we also try to project and we use
 
03:47:09.309 --> 03:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
several assumptions um the some of them
 
03:47:11.550 --> 03:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
don't don't are are not you know perhaps
 
03:47:13.950 --> 03:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
this sum around are not going to be U
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
working as well but we we assume that
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to issue again approximately
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
60 million in bonds we made some
 
03:47:22.030 --> 03:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
assumptions revenues were going to
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
increase there's another scenario there
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we used um revenues were flat so I
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
think that's probably more likely that
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's a more um appropriate
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
scenario to review but but when you look
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
at those R so what we do is we try to
 
03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
analyze what the how the ratios are
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
going to perform over time so with that
 
03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
scenario and this study uh you'll see
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
that this the the ratios continue to be
 
03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
manageable so that's what we want to
 
03:47:49.630 --> 03:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
look at the revenue the the rating
 
03:47:53.309 --> 03:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
agencies worry about um that metric
 
03:47:55.950 --> 03:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
increasing too much if we're close we're
 
03:47:59.309 --> 03:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
in the 8% 10% will be really bad we
 
03:48:02.149 --> 03:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
probably have a downgrade so so the
 
03:48:04.349 --> 03:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
rating indenes will start worry if our
 
03:48:07.070 --> 03:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
if our if we start issuing too much debt
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
our revenues are not performing that
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
means those metrics are going to start
 
03:48:14.830 --> 03:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
being not as positive and so that's when
 
03:48:16.469 --> 03:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
they will Pro put us in some type of
 
03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
negative outlook now you just mentioned
 
03:48:20.429 --> 03:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
other things that are going on one of
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
the things that is considered credit
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
positive is the way we manage our debt
 
03:48:26.429 --> 03:48:26.439 align:start position:0%
so there are other things that are
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
coming like the whatc claims and and
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
other budgetary pressure pressures um
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
the rating agenes are going to look at
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
that they're going to look at the amount
 
03:48:38.469 --> 03:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
of um the amount of reserves that we
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
have so this year it looks like we're
 
03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
have a projected deficit um so depending
 
03:48:46.510 --> 03:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
on how much we take from the rainy day
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
fund they want they're going to want to
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
see what we're going to do over the next
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
few years to replenish those funds so
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
again it's a whole picture the way we
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
manage our debt is one of the probably
 
03:49:00.590 --> 03:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
easiest way to manage our our our uh
 
03:49:02.990 --> 03:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
finances uh the other you know again the
 
03:49:05.229 --> 03:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
other aspects of the of our finances are
 
03:49:08.429 --> 03:49:08.439 align:start position:0%
a little more um um challenging I will
 
03:49:10.990 --> 03:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
say especially when we want to maintain
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
our revenues um you know flat or or
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
um again we just have to produce a
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
balanced budget so I know it can be
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
challenging but representative evil yeah
 
03:49:25.710 --> 03:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
so I mean basically uh what we have in
 
03:49:28.110 --> 03:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
our rainy day fund is a factor that the
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
rating and and of course with the rating
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
agencies uh their opinion on things
 
03:49:36.030 --> 03:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
helps with the salability of our bonds
 
03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
right and the interest rat so it's all
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
like sort of relevant so what we so
 
03:49:42.510 --> 03:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
we've been building up our rainy day
 
03:49:45.030 --> 03:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
funds but now there's a propos proposal
 
03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the table uh to take 81 million out
 
03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
right um so I mean I'm asking the
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
question also because in the governor's
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
budget she didn't put this time um
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
anything for the prison whereas last
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
time and there's nothing in the capital
 
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
budget so you know we're talking a lot
 
03:50:06.189 --> 03:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
about what to do about that so that's
 
03:50:08.670 --> 03:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
that would be on top of if if you know
 
03:50:11.590 --> 03:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
we just do the 120 potential of another
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
40 if people and then we have the
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
looming issue of the of the YDC I mean
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's the only other big looming thing
 
03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
I see out there and that's just not
 
03:50:26.670 --> 03:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the budget at this point so
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
just knowing from my experience with the
 
03:50:31.630 --> 03:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
capital budget and this debt I mean it
 
03:50:36.110 --> 03:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
all hangs together right yeah yes and
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
what I will add is
 
03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
um the so we have calls with r agencies
 
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
next week actually and the I what the
 
03:50:45.910 --> 03:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
questions that will comment and I'm
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
positive about this is what is the state
 
03:50:50.349 --> 03:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
planning like what is what is going to
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
be the plan for the YDC uh even if it
 
03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
takes 10 years to to to to cover that
 
03:50:57.990 --> 03:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
what is the plan um you know what is the
 
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
plan for the rainy day fund they just
 
03:51:01.990 --> 03:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
obviously depending on the answers that
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
I provide that's how they're going to
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
see okay let taking Montana stable
 
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
Outlook anything that they hear that is
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
is um not favorable obviously they can
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
put us on a watch so uh it's very
 
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
important obviously the work that you're
 
03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
doing to understand all of the pieces
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
and and you absolutely correct if our
 
03:51:22.710 --> 03:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
ratings are um if we maintain the
 
03:51:24.429 --> 03:51:24.439 align:start position:0%
highest ratings our borrowing costs are
 
03:51:26.830 --> 03:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
going to be uh low and and they're going
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
to be uh again more investors are going
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
to want to buy our bonds and and again
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
that um lowers a cost and just and so
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue picture is also part of that
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
right yes and our revenues have been
 
03:51:43.229 --> 03:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely the revenues have been
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
not performing as well so one of the
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
things they look at they they look at is
 
03:51:49.990 --> 03:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
how diverse our revenues are so for
 
03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
example if the business um business
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
taxes are now working this this year or
 
03:51:58.349 --> 03:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
you know currently they obviously is
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
important to maintain a different type
 
03:52:01.990 --> 03:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that could provide in
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
different times uh again having uh
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
diversity is important um so yes so we
 
03:52:10.110 --> 03:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
should add gambling is that what you're
 
03:52:12.590 --> 03:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
saying I heard that
 
03:52:17.309 --> 03:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
what start divers all right anyways okay
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
um let's keep keep going thank you yes
 
03:52:25.269 --> 03:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
um page
 
03:52:28.030 --> 03:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
148 so this is something else I think we
 
03:52:31.189 --> 03:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
did talk about this last time
 
03:52:33.550 --> 03:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
um what you can see toward the bottom of
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
the page this is the uh money from the
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
Fidelity 50 529
 
03:52:44.550 --> 03:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
plans um and which is given out in Grant
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
in um scholarships I guess yes um and I
 
03:52:52.269 --> 03:52:52.279 align:start position:0%
think we asked I don't know if we asked
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
what was what's the why is it going up 5
 
03:52:59.510 --> 03:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
million per year from the actual to the
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
budgeted number so um fiscal year 24 was
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
a a a year um I will say that the the
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
commission um that oversees this program
 
03:53:18.349 --> 03:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
was trying to send less money to the um
 
03:53:21.910 --> 03:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
endowments and more uh funds to students
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
directly through uh direct scholarships
 
03:53:27.269 --> 03:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to find our balance um
 
03:53:29.269 --> 03:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
there was a period of time that um it
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't the the commission didn't reach
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
the target we um we're trying to
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
disperse as much money as possible so
 
03:53:39.389 --> 03:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
that was a year that is wasn't um the
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
criteria utiliz for the scholarships uh
 
03:53:45.750 --> 03:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to send um
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
um give out as much as as many
 
03:53:51.309 --> 03:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
scholarships as as we wanted um FIS year
 
03:53:54.910 --> 03:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
26 though and 27 is it looks like we
 
03:53:56.870 --> 03:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
were going to be able to provide more
 
03:54:01.389 --> 03:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
scholarships to students um based on um
 
03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
colleges universities provide provide us
 
03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
with estimates of um their eligible
 
03:54:10.149 --> 03:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
students we looked at that um last
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
December and it looks like we're going
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
to um be able to help more students um
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of or next year and
 
03:54:18.800 --> 03:54:20.309 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of or next year and
going

03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
forward and um so again you you can't
 
03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
really see that because we we tried to
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
budget um what
 
03:54:32.590 --> 03:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
we essentially we're trying to spend all
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
of the money the fact that 24 didn't uh
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
it didn't work out uh was an anomaly um
 
03:54:41.149 --> 03:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
in 26 again we tried to budget all of
 
03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
the funds that we anticipate collecting
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
from uh from Fidelity um hopefully we're
 
03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
able to spend that money I think that's
 
03:54:52.510 --> 03:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
what that's did some of the 24 money
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
laps in some way or or is it still go
 
03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
back into the trust fund for future for
 
03:55:00.670 --> 03:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
future expenditure for future grants so
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
so these 26 and 27 numbers are bigger
 
03:55:06.429 --> 03:55:06.439 align:start position:0%
than what's actually coming from
 
03:55:08.070 --> 03:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
Fidelity because we're going to use some
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
of this trust fund money or not or you
 
03:55:13.229 --> 03:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the education trust fund
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
no this is uh this this is a trust um is
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
is called the New Hampshire excellence
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
and higher education trust fund okay the
 
03:55:25.229 --> 03:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
money that comes from um from Fidelity
 
03:55:28.830 --> 03:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
is deposit in that fund and is used um
 
03:55:32.590 --> 03:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
for two scholarship programs right um so
 
03:55:35.429 --> 03:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
if not all of the funds are spent then
 
03:55:37.950 --> 03:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
it goes back into the trust fund for
 
03:55:42.269 --> 03:55:42.279 align:start position:0%
future use um the I guess one thing I'm
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
going to add um the
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
funds FIS year 26 funds are already
 
03:55:53.429 --> 03:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
students already know is we we notify
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
colleges universities that they were
 
03:55:57.389 --> 03:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
going to receive this funds they already
 
03:56:02.590 --> 03:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
are preparing the um fin financial aid
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
packaging including all of those funds
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
for students so um we do anticipate
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
spending this amount and perhaps more
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
from the trust fund I see so it does
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
have a very healthy balance here he does
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay right so I just tell the
 
03:56:25.950 --> 03:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
um uh tell the committee this is
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
something that division 2 is aware of
 
03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
and and may be making changes in this
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
area so even though it looks sort of
 
03:56:35.149 --> 03:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
like it's on our side it isn't
 
03:56:35.159 --> 03:56:38.110 align:start position:0%
like it's on our side it isn't
really

03:56:38.110 --> 03:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:56:40.710 --> 03:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
um again the only thing I will add to
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
that is essentially funds for FIS year
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
26 have been promised to students just
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
want to keep that in mind yeah yeah
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
right exactly they might
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
need right but anyways but there's
 
03:57:02.469 --> 03:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue also right so yeah um okay um so
 
03:57:05.630 --> 03:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
what what was just handed out was uh
 
03:57:07.469 --> 03:57:07.479 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of dedicated funds that are
 
03:57:10.429 --> 03:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
all uh controlled by the treasury so so
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
it gets you some some
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
information about that um one of the
 
03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
163 so uh the Japanese government gave
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
us $110,000 in
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.550 --> 03:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
$216,000 in this account
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
so um that's for the Japanese not
 
03:57:44.429 --> 03:57:44.439 align:start position:0%
oh support program it's it's because we
 
03:57:48.790 --> 03:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
they had um a a peace treaty negotiated
 
03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth I guess with with uh
 
03:57:56.349 --> 03:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
Russia and um they this was the gift for
 
03:58:00.990 --> 03:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
the Japanese as a result so 120 years
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
ago well I think they did some yeah
 
03:58:08.070 --> 03:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
anyways so um I I'm actually on the El
 
03:58:12.229 --> 03:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
chip board and um so they just went
 
03:58:14.550 --> 03:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
through they go through an annual Grant
 
03:58:17.790 --> 03:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
run round and they spend the maximal
 
03:58:20.670 --> 03:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money every time and
 
03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
so I believe all they really have left
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
is at this point is
 
03:58:28.030 --> 03:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
$600,000 something I mean yeah they they
 
03:58:31.349 --> 03:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
make all these grants it's a very I mean
 
03:58:33.309 --> 03:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
you guys know it's a very competitive
 
03:58:37.349 --> 03:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
program and they they uh leave no money
 
03:58:38.590 --> 03:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
table it's interesting to see how the
 
03:58:43.149 --> 03:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
real estate business has dropped off
 
03:58:45.070 --> 03:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
right because
 
03:58:47.870 --> 03:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
much more Revenue came in 2122 than in
 
03:58:50.950 --> 03:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
23 24 I mean it's really dependent on on
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
real estate sales but um I was trying to
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
remember maybe last year they had
 
03:58:59.229 --> 03:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
applications twice as much as the money
 
03:59:01.790 --> 03:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
they had to give out so it's a very
 
03:59:04.030 --> 03:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
competitive program and as I say they're
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
not ones to sit on the money it goes out
 
03:59:08.189 --> 03:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
the door
 
03:59:12.149 --> 03:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
annually okay all right good let's keep
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
going here
 
03:59:18.269 --> 03:59:18.279 align:start position:0%
all right so that answers that question
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
there's actually about I'm sorry Mr go
 
03:59:22.469 --> 03:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
ahead there's something about the Ben
 
03:59:25.710 --> 03:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
Thomson trust fund I think in hb2 yes
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
yes and I can speak and I can speak to
 
03:59:31.630 --> 03:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
that um so we we are
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
um we had a discussion with the univers
 
03:59:41.070 --> 03:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
university system to try to um move the
 
03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
right now by law I need to have custody
 
03:59:46.110 --> 03:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
of of the of the trust fund and the
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
conversation that we were having is um
 
03:59:50.830 --> 03:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
the possibility of transferring that
 
03:59:54.630 --> 03:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
trust to uh the UNH Foundation
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
essentially they will um they
 
04:00:00.429 --> 04:00:00.439 align:start position:0%
will um essentially they will do the
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
same the same um they are the
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries uh University of New
 
04:00:06.510 --> 04:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the beneficiary so they
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
will um add the trust fund to um um
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
again it will be over overseeing the way
 
04:00:17.309 --> 04:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
they they they do their um their
 
04:00:20.550 --> 04:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
endowments so um what we are so house
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
will too the what we are what we need to
 
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
do in order for that to happen is we
 
04:00:28.590 --> 04:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
need to repeal all of the laws um
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
relative to the Ben Thompson trust fund
 
04:00:34.630 --> 04:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
um that says that we the treasury needs
 
04:00:36.510 --> 04:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
to have C the treasurer needs to have
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
custody of that fund and at the same
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
time we will be working with the
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to try to change
 
04:00:43.760 --> 04:00:44.790 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to try to change
the

04:00:44.790 --> 04:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:48.149 --> 04:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
purpose of of
 
04:00:48.159 --> 04:00:50.469 align:start position:0%
purpose of of
um

04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:56.429 --> 04:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
um I guess the trust um and it will be I
 
04:00:59.790 --> 04:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
guess the court will will have to
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
um make the decision to be able to
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
transfer all of the funds to the um
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire foundation
 
04:01:08.710 --> 04:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
so we will have to again um repealing
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
the loss is one step the other step is
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
is work with Department of Justice to be
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
able to change that purpose and and and
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
for the uh un Foundation to have those
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
funds um so that's why it's in house
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
um it was um so again the university
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
system is interested in having those
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
funds um they will do a wonderful job
 
04:01:32.910 --> 04:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
managing it um what what is happening
 
04:01:36.309 --> 04:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
right now is what we sent to um the
 
04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire is what was
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
established in the laws of
 
04:01:44.149 --> 04:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
1909 I believe that says we need to send
 
04:01:45.750 --> 04:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
a quy payment
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
to um UNH and that's the amount that is
 
04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
in the law so we have to either
 
04:01:56.429 --> 04:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
so regardless of the path we follow the
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
law needs to be again the whole
 
04:02:01.229 --> 04:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
situation needs to be re-evaluated to
 
04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
really understand how much the
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire should
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
receive from this from this trust um
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
$331,000 is is probably not the right
 
04:02:14.110 --> 04:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
amount at this time so again um the pth
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
that we're following is working with
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to change to to
 
04:02:20.149 --> 04:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
change the custody move it to the
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire Foundation
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
um but again step one is to one of the
 
04:02:28.590 --> 04:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
steps is to repeal these laws and why um
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
our expenses double this this uh
 
04:02:36.910 --> 04:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
payment is that expenses for managing
 
04:02:40.149 --> 04:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
the fund is there in there I believe
 
04:02:42.990 --> 04:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
this are indirect cost right is that the
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.309 --> 04:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
125 yes and there a cost 100 that's what
 
04:02:51.319 --> 04:02:54.309 align:start position:0%
125 yes and there a cost 100 that's what
it

04:02:54.309 --> 04:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
is and so the expenditure says what we
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
sent the um
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
un right but it in the in the
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
description it says you're sending you
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
an H
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:16.750 --> 04:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
62,000 it's 31 30 31 887 correct that's
 
04:03:19.110 --> 04:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's I'm an engineer so that's 32,000
 
04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
you see yes I believe that's the amount
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
where right so the question is but you
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
see in the table right expenses
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
62,64 oh you're looking at this details
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
oh right right so these expenses are the
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
the management of the fund the the
 
04:03:42.269 --> 04:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
investment fees okay so that's my point
 
04:03:45.389 --> 04:03:45.399 align:start position:0%
is half of this is going to TD
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
Bank is and only half is going to the
 
04:03:50.670 --> 04:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
university that is correct so the amount
 
04:03:52.590 --> 04:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to the university is is not
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
correct it's just the amount that has
 
04:03:57.790 --> 04:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
been it's been sent for decades this is
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
why we're reviewing that fund but again
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
the path that we're following right now
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
is to try to move those funds from our
 
04:04:06.670 --> 04:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
custody to the University of New
 
04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um again that that's the based
 
04:04:12.990 --> 04:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
on conversations that's what everyone is
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
interested in doing so Mr chair so so
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
the idea is rather than you managing the
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
fund it would be the university that's
 
04:04:21.910 --> 04:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
correct I mean we we don't have a
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
problem managing the fund but but again
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
we just need to um we just need to
 
04:04:28.149 --> 04:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
review how much money the University of
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
Ni Hampshire should receive and that was
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
again that could be that path that we
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
followed perhaps that's what the core
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
decides um so that's what's being
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed right now yeah and it's not
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
like they're doing a bad job I mean you
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
look at other sources that's the revenue
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
right that's the inv the investment
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
income right and those are not bad
 
04:04:51.309 --> 04:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
numbers really
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
correct okay yeah CU that's right here
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
but it's just uh
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
anyway okay very
 
04:04:59.880 --> 04:05:01.469 align:start position:0%
anyway okay very
good

04:05:01.469 --> 04:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
so uh let's go to
 
04:05:07.710 --> 04:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
page 149 at the very
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
bottom um what is the governor's
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund yes
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
that is a scholarship program also
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
overseen by the college tuition Savings
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
Plan advisory
 
04:05:25.389 --> 04:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
commission and that is a program that's
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
a that's a that's a scholarship program
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
funds um just for the heck of it or yeah
 
04:05:39.870 --> 04:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
yes um and it just adds to what we're
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
getting from Fidelity to so there are
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
two different programs and there two
 
04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
different programs um when we were
 
04:05:49.149 --> 04:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
putting the budget together I did ask
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's office if they were
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
interested in funding the program and
 
04:05:54.590 --> 04:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted to fund it so that's what
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
you see here okay I mean it looks like
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
they even added a million or something
 
04:06:03.229 --> 04:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
is that so typically we've been
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
receiving about $3
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
million um since this program was um
 
04:06:12.910 --> 04:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
established $3 million each year to fund
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
there are um this is a program that is
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
being reviewed just because the way this
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
this this the eligibility and the
 
04:06:28.349 --> 04:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
law uh we're not finding enough students
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
that qualify for that so but in the
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
meantime right there's a there's a
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's a balance here if you look at
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
the um dedicated funds report you use we
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
have a is there a special fund for this
 
04:06:46.750 --> 04:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
balance of about 14 million that those
 
04:06:46.760 --> 04:06:48.389 align:start position:0%
balance of about 14 million that those
14

04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
14
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
million approximately half is restricted
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
the other one is is available um the
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
restricted portion is is because the way
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
this program works is when those
 
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
scholarships are awarded um they are
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
spent over a period of four years
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
they're now all spent in the first year
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
so the awards are foure Awards and we
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
need to wait until they're all spent but
 
04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
then we've been able to to award funds
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
every year um but again so we have to
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
mark on a restricted portion of of that
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
amount but right now it we have about
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
$10 million available unrestricted for
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
that fund just because um they're not
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
enough students to um that have been
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for that program so so why
 
04:07:39.109 --> 04:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
don't we see the 2.7 from the general
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
well it is it is about if you look at
 
04:07:52.510 --> 04:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures of 24 about 2.3 million in
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
expenses yes that's how much we've been
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
able to disperse every
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
year right so what we see under other
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
sources that's the general
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
fund all
 
04:08:07.000 --> 04:08:08.630 align:start position:0%
fund all
sources

04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
sources
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct and what we see under
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's the in the investment
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
income correct gotcha okay so it's a
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
little backwards from the other one the
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
other page we
 
04:08:20.399 --> 04:08:22.710 align:start position:0%
other page we
saw

04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
saw
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay this is General okay very
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
good yes represent R thank you Mr chair
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
so um on the governor scholarship fund
 
04:08:37.269 --> 04:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
you said that not it's not fully
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
dispersed to the goals because not
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
enough students are eligible for it is
 
04:08:45.109 --> 04:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
there a possibility of raising the
 
04:08:48.429 --> 04:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
scholarship for those that are eligible
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
because College expenses have gone up I
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how long we've had that
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
$2,000 a year award so so that program I
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
believe was established in 2018 and um
 
04:09:04.510 --> 04:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
the eligibility criteria is in the is is
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
um included in the law so it needs to be
 
04:09:09.550 --> 04:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
the student is to be palale eligible
 
04:09:09.560 --> 04:09:10.670 align:start position:0%
the student is to be palale eligible
full-time

04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
student um and they receive and and if
 
04:09:17.790 --> 04:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
the student is
 
04:09:20.910 --> 04:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
um receives the the uh New Hampshire
 
04:09:23.429 --> 04:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
scholar designation the student receives
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
$2,000 if the student who qualifies
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the designation the student
 
04:09:28.479 --> 04:09:29.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the designation the student
receives

04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
receives
 
04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
$1,000 um the rules uh made that program
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
a little more complicated because the
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
student needs to be continuously
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
enrolled in an institution so if a
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
full-time student decides to um skip a
 
04:09:48.630 --> 04:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
semester then automatically they lose um
 
04:09:51.870 --> 04:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
that scholarship that Grant um so again
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's just the the structure of how this
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
fund was designed um the commission is
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
is very interested in reviewing um the
 
04:10:03.309 --> 04:10:03.319 align:start position:0%
three programs that they're overseeing
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
now and and try to see if there's a
 
04:10:08.349 --> 04:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
better way to disperse all of the
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
funds okay go ahead so if a student
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
receives a scol scholarship but then
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
decides for some reason or another not
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
to return to school for a semester do
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
they think does it pick up if they do
 
04:10:24.109 --> 04:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
return or does it forever it's gone it's
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
whever gone for us
 
04:10:30.750 --> 04:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
student all right yes go ahead thank you
 
04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh can a student apply if
 
04:10:35.550 --> 04:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
theyve they're already in college and
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't know about this program and
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're already a sophomore junior can
 
04:10:42.550 --> 04:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
they can they apply at that point no it
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
has to be full-time student completing
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
High School
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
um full-time completing high school so
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit limited and I believe
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the program was to
 
04:10:57.870 --> 04:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
encourage um full-time enrollment and so
 
04:10:59.790 --> 04:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
students can
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
um uh again um start uh a college
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
education and stay there receive these
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
grants and essentially start in the
 
04:11:12.349 --> 04:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
workforce right away so it's a different
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
type of program with intention to
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
promote um you know not enrolling
 
04:11:19.830 --> 04:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
part-time and taking years to to
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
complete because um there are studies
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
that show if some students are part-time
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't complete the
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
courses they get student loans and it
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
just becomes more expensive so the idea
 
04:11:33.309 --> 04:11:33.319 align:start position:0%
of this program was to try to help these
 
04:11:35.469 --> 04:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
students to join the workforce as soon
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
as possible and is the program well
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
publicized within the school system and
 
04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
you know C counselors teachers do they
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
know of this
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
program I'm not clear I think I my
 
04:11:49.109 --> 04:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
opinion I think um schools could
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
probably do a better job promoting this
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
program but but again I'm not I'm not
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
really clear this this is we hold the
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
funds and and and colleges universities
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
are responsible for promoting the
 
04:12:02.710 --> 04:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
programs and um there's more that
 
04:12:04.229 --> 04:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
probably the treasury can do and those
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
are the those are the thoughts we've had
 
04:12:07.469 --> 04:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
to to be able to promote this programs
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the future more um one of our goals
 
04:12:14.910 --> 04:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
too thank my pleasure okay
 
04:12:17.550 --> 04:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
um go ahead represent thank you thank
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%

number one you don't want to be a member
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
of right or or you think that the
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
commission itself doesn't meet that it's
 
04:13:43.229 --> 04:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
not worth having Etc we would like to
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
hear about those kind of things right
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to re in you know
 
04:13:50.349 --> 04:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of commissions that we have
 
04:13:53.070 --> 04:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
to appoint people too and many of them
 
04:13:54.750 --> 04:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
they never meet and then you know things
 
04:13:58.030 --> 04:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't happen so any any suggestions you
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
can send us to us later but think about
 
04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
that because I'm sure that you know
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're automatically added to this that
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
and the other thing right so yeah okay
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I will do
 
04:14:12.790 --> 04:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
that okay so then the last one I guess
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
we going to talk about is uh lchip which
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
we've already mentioned here and and the
 
04:14:21.550 --> 04:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
main thing is that the budgeted amount
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
here is not necessarily equal to the
 
04:14:28.750 --> 04:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
revenue this is just a big guess right
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
this this 4.7 million that was spent in
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
2024 but the income that year was only
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
about three so um yeses I'm sure that
 
04:14:42.750 --> 04:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
the folks at elip would be happy to
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
provide provide more information um
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
especially on how they've spent down the
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
fund um over time if you'd like them
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
too if that's helpful right but the
 
04:14:56.590 --> 04:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
point is we're budgeting five million
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
right it's probably it may not be that
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
it may not end up being that high under
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
and and as long as we're talking about
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
lchip there's also in this handout that
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
you have um the community conservation
 
04:15:10.030 --> 04:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
endowment you remember the young woman
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
we had in
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
here whenever that was last week we were
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
lcip um endowment um and and her work
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a similar concept here
 
04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
where the elip board has the when it
 
04:15:30.030 --> 04:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
says here revenue and funding source
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
narrative they make sure that whenever
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
they close a land deal a certain amount
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
of money goes into an endowment for
 
04:15:41.229 --> 04:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
stewardship and for oversight of the of
 
04:15:44.429 --> 04:15:44.439 align:start position:0%
the properties that you know they
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
help fund or or you know support in some
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
way so that's what this endowment is all
 
04:15:55.070 --> 04:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
about and I also explained at the time
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
that this is what a lot of these land
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
trusts are doing because they have a big
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility when they oversee these
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
properties so let's ask about that one
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
so um this is Page 165 Community
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
conservation Endowment in the in the
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds hand out so why was
 
04:16:17.149 --> 04:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
there no Revenue in
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
so that is a very good question I will
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
follow up on
 
04:16:27.439 --> 04:16:29.550 align:start position:0%
follow up on
it

04:16:29.550 --> 04:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
I sorry I have to believe there was some
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
right because they closed a whole bunch
 
04:16:35.520 --> 04:16:36.309 align:start position:0%
right because they closed a whole bunch
of

04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
Grants no but the grant stuff is the
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
other sources expens expenses yes I'm
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
not sure what is happen in here ible ask
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing that the revenue column is
 
04:16:49.950 --> 04:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
the investment income or interest right
 
04:16:53.710 --> 04:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
oh I thought it was the endowment that's
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
the other sources got got yes I will
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
follow up on this you look I'm not clear
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay so this is the kind of pay yeah on
 
04:17:04.269 --> 04:17:04.279 align:start position:0%
our other committee we look at this
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah all the time okay well when
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
we meet so anyway all right other
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
questions for the treasurer or should we
 
04:17:13.790 --> 04:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
let her get back to work I do have one
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
request if I may um one request that we
 
04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
we we made to the governor as part of
 
04:17:24.870 --> 04:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget was to change one
 
04:17:24.880 --> 04:17:26.590 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget was to change one
law

04:17:26.590 --> 04:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
to the didn't make it I'm not sure if it
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
was an oversight I haven't I haven't
 
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
received an answer but
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to change um this statute
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
that will allow me to appoint more than
 
04:17:42.429 --> 04:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
two assistant treasurers um right now I
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
have two assistant treasures and I would
 
04:17:47.149 --> 04:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
like to be able to reclassify a
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
classified position to an assistant
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
treasure position which will be an
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
unclassified position so by changing the
 
04:17:57.109 --> 04:17:57.119 align:start position:0%
law and removing the number two will
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
allow me to reclassify a classified
 
04:18:03.630 --> 04:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
position to an unclassified position so
 
04:18:06.309 --> 04:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
essentially um it's not really it
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a budgetary impact the
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
only impact that it what it does right
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
now is this particular position
 
04:18:16.429 --> 04:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes uh because it's a is is a
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
member of management sometimes the
 
04:18:19.309 --> 04:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
person needs to work more so there's
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
overtime and limitations as part of the
 
04:18:25.469 --> 04:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
classified system so um that is a
 
04:18:28.030 --> 04:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
request I would like to make if if if
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
you um so this person wouldn't be
 
04:18:33.309 --> 04:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and Council no
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
it would just be assistant t i i appoint
 
04:18:38.349 --> 04:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
I appoint assistant Treasurer so it will
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
be an um an appointee of the treasurer
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
but you would keep the salary the same
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
correct it's it's pretty comparable
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair go ahead um just so you
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
don't have to I mean we might have you
 
04:18:55.109 --> 04:18:55.119 align:start position:0%
back I don't but there's another thing
 
04:18:57.630 --> 04:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
in hb2 of course we don't have the final
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
document but there's
 
04:19:02.349 --> 04:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
another provision in here budget and
 
04:19:04.830 --> 04:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations revolving funds I didn't
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
know if you wanted to talk about I'm
 
04:19:09.550 --> 04:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't get to that that request
 
04:19:09.560 --> 04:19:11.229 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't get to that that request
relates

04:19:11.229 --> 04:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
relates
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
to so this is Debt
 
04:19:16.990 --> 04:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
Service um we were discussing how Debt
 
04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
Service works and sometimes
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
um sometimes what we um we typically add
 
04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
a footnote in the budget for for example
 
04:19:29.710 --> 04:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
for Debt Service um pay with General
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
funds but agencies also sometimes have
 
04:19:35.790 --> 04:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
um again they they we discuss how they
 
04:19:38.429 --> 04:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
have thatb service and their budgets but
 
04:19:41.790 --> 04:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
their their budgets um their Debt
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
Service labs at the end of the fiscal
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
year uh again with what when we put
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
together a budget we say in the footnote
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
that the the funds will lapse at the end
 
04:19:55.389 --> 04:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
of the bium so sometimes what happens is
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
if if the estimates of Debt Service are
 
04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
not good estimates um agencies need to
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
go before fiscal to request changes in
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
their line um so what this will do is
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
essentially it will allow them to now
 
04:20:12.149 --> 04:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
lapse those funds in the first year of
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
the of the banum and if they have any um
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
funds are not spent if they will last at
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
the end of the vium so this this change
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
in the law is just adding the
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
two um
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
classes there's I guess this existing
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
law under budge and Appropriations there
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
are some classes already that don't
 
04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
lapse in the first year of the banum so
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is adding debts this The
 
04:20:43.870 --> 04:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
Debt Service classes
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
to this group of of of I guess um
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
budgetary lines that don't lapse until
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
they lapse until the end of the vum I
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
guess I should say that uh it's just to
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate the payment of Deb service
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
and uh agencies don't have to go and and
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
and request funds one of the things that
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't want to we try not to
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
ask your permission to pay that service
 
04:21:09.149 --> 04:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
we have to pay that service um investors
 
04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
expect us to pay that service so um we
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to care investors that we
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the funds to pay that service
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
so this will allow us to just have a
 
04:21:19.630 --> 04:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
little more flexibility uh it will it
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
will be part of the law okay sounds
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable yes representative thank you
 
04:21:28.750 --> 04:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
um so when I'm looking at the hb2 you
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
know the draft we got so it's you've got
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
in there about um transferring the
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Thompson fund to UNH and then
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
you've got what you just discussed about
 
04:21:42.070 --> 04:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
the debt service and then the third one
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
is removing two from the assistant
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
treasurer do you hav't have that statute
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
I do I have language right here that I
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
can share with you if they'll probably
 
04:21:53.710 --> 04:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
keep that will just allow for that the
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
LBA all right yes so the statue itself
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
is R say RSA 6 colon 20a and all it will
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
do right now it says the state treasur
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
may appoint two assistant treasurers and
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would like is to remove
 
04:22:10.349 --> 04:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
the number two okay great that thank you
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
but I have some that I can share
 
04:22:17.469 --> 04:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
how about changing two to
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
three um I don't want to have 20
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
assistant I I probably don't need 20 but
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
um you just want one more right um yes I
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
think right now yes that will that will
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
that will solve my my concern but like
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
for example I was looking at the statute
 
04:22:43.950 --> 04:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
um six stat Secretary of State statutes
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
they they have a similar language um
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
than what the treasure statutes show and
 
04:22:52.990 --> 04:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
they also don't have a number so I was
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
just narro that you you want to be in
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
the same category right well when don't
 
04:23:00.510 --> 04:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
we add a number for them too
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
so generous with the numbers today yeah
 
04:23:07.109 --> 04:23:07.119 align:start position:0%
so just but what just so what you're
 
04:23:09.510 --> 04:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
asking though was unrelated to what you
 
04:23:11.790 --> 04:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
have had in your presentation you were
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
asking for authorization for one more
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
employee to help you track funds and I
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
just uh I don't even remember that we
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
talked about that are you struggling to
 
04:23:25.830 --> 04:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
track all the funds that you
 
04:23:29.469 --> 04:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
have this was probably the the an ask
 
04:23:33.149 --> 04:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
and the wrong time of the the the budget
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
or Rong period but um so we we were
 
04:23:39.550 --> 04:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
asking for we're we're asking for one
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
position because um that will be part of
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
the business office um because what what
 
04:23:49.229 --> 04:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is we're going to
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
um right now we have about 40 trust and
 
04:23:55.149 --> 04:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
ceral accounts that are maintain and
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets um that is um that is
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
something we want to correct and we need
 
04:24:03.070 --> 04:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
to add all of those funds into the
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
accounting system
 
04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
um when that happens obviously the
 
04:24:10.229 --> 04:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
accounting the accounting will increase
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
the transactions will increase um so all
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
we were hoping is that to have an
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
additional person to help us with that
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
work um I could completely understand if
 
04:24:23.630 --> 04:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's not possibility this year but we
 
04:24:27.870 --> 04:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
still um again when we asked um as part
 
04:24:29.229 --> 04:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
of the agency budget the governor's
 
04:24:31.830 --> 04:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
budget it it was it was part of it was
 
04:24:34.269 --> 04:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
included in the in the in in the
 
04:24:34.279 --> 04:24:35.469 align:start position:0%
included in the in the in in the
governor's

04:24:35.469 --> 04:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
proposal but that's that's the reason we
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
just it's just additional work that the
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
business office will have uh again we
 
04:24:43.710 --> 04:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
will we will man if if that's not
 
04:24:46.109 --> 04:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
something that can be done this
 
04:24:46.119 --> 04:24:51.070 align:start position:0%
something that can be done this
year

04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay is that something a part-time
 
04:24:56.389 --> 04:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
person or aemp could help with or not
 
04:24:58.590 --> 04:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
really perhaps I don't believe we have
 
04:25:00.269 --> 04:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to have part-time we didn't
 
04:25:00.279 --> 04:25:01.510 align:start position:0%
the ability to have part-time we didn't
budget

04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
oh we didn't budget for a part-time but
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
but yes I imagine that could be
 
04:25:11.590 --> 04:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
helpful to quote the chair we can do all
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
04:25:15.149 --> 04:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
representative cell thank you Mr chair
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
so if we were to allow a third assistant
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh assistant Treasurer and you appointed
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
one would they come over as a lateral in
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
their job grade or would they have to be
 
04:25:29.710 --> 04:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
promoted into an a higher
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
grade no the way that salary is
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
structured that classified position
 
04:25:38.590 --> 04:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
essentially makes about the same amount
 
04:25:40.269 --> 04:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
um that an assistant Treasurer makes so
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of salary there's really no
 
04:25:44.670 --> 04:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
change will be a lateral move it's just
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's just a change in the reification
 
04:25:50.910 --> 04:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
would be a change of title essentially
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
the duties will be the same it's just
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
instead of being a classified person
 
04:25:57.070 --> 04:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
this position will move into to the
 
04:25:59.590 --> 04:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
unclassified system thank you so they
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
could work 30 more than 37 and a half
 
04:26:04.269 --> 04:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
hours a week a little more we tried to
 
04:26:08.109 --> 04:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
manage that work too without over 10
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay other questions representative
 
04:26:11.680 --> 04:26:14.510 align:start position:0%
yeah okay other questions representative
lean

04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.870 --> 04:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
again just for the minutes are you going
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
to act on this request today or sit on
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
it for the two additional no we'll we'll
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
roll them all together okay thank you
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
sitting sitting anything else no all
 
04:26:31.229 --> 04:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you very
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
much hopefully we won't have to see you
 
04:26:34.590 --> 04:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
again that's
 
04:26:34.600 --> 04:26:36.670 align:start position:0%
again that's
okay

04:26:36.670 --> 04:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:42.510 --> 04:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
but yeah okay um now for the committee
 
04:26:46.189 --> 04:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
so this this um spreadsheet I handed
 
04:26:50.349 --> 04:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
out um this is just you know my own sort
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
of notes and and um what I put on it
 
04:26:58.510 --> 04:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
was uh essentially all of
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
our um all of our agencies as listed in
 
04:27:04.990 --> 04:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
the index of house bill
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
one uh the first and last pages those
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
are the house one
 
04:27:14.030 --> 04:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
Pages um the fiscal year 19
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
numbers um those that's adjusted
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
authorized in fiscal year 19 so one
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
thing we're using is to compare that
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
number with the 25 number which is also
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
an adjusted authorized number where is
 
04:27:31.630 --> 04:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year
 
04:27:35.830 --> 04:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
um the the fiscal year 24 number is an
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
actual right so you you understand the
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
difference um and then the the next two
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
numbers are the governor's budget
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
numbers so just as a now all of these
 
04:27:50.429 --> 04:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
are General funds with the exception of
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
two lines so for
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
doit and for
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
oplc I put in their total I'm sorry and
 
04:28:03.790 --> 04:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
liquor for three of these so for doit
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
for oplc and for liquor I put in the
 
04:28:10.990 --> 04:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
total funds number not the general funds
 
04:28:12.389 --> 04:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
number because they don't have they have
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
essentially no General funds or very
 
04:28:17.429 --> 04:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
little but but for
 
04:28:20.630 --> 04:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
doit a significant part of that is
 
04:28:23.469 --> 04:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
General funds right but they' all flow
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
via some other agency at least half
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
right at Le yeah maybe probably about
 
04:28:31.389 --> 04:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
half I guess be my guess but you know
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
they got Highway funds they got federal
 
04:28:35.710 --> 04:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
funds and all this sort of stuff and
 
04:28:39.790 --> 04:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
then for uh oplc it's all total
 
04:28:42.750 --> 04:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
funds um and
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
um just but just by way of
 
04:28:45.760 --> 04:28:47.710 align:start position:0%
um just but just by way of
comparison

04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
um you know the money they spend comes
 
04:28:54.189 --> 04:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
out of everybody's professional licenses
 
04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
right so uh and they they that's a hard
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
one to compare because we've changed
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
over the years we've significantly
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
changed which kinds of professions they
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
handle right so so it's hard to compare
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
you know apples and apples from year to
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
year and then uh liquor while everything
 
04:29:19.389 --> 04:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
they spend is is liquor funds
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
but uh whatever they don't spend becomes
 
04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
General funds right so so it's very
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
important not to spend in order to you
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
know yeah so so we can think of this as
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
all General funds if you want to um
 
04:29:37.630 --> 04:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps so anyways that's that's the
 
04:29:42.189 --> 04:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
um uh that's the story on this stuff
 
04:29:44.590 --> 04:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
okay um and then all the notes are just
 
04:29:49.109 --> 04:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
you know my own little um thoughts but
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
you know obviously um none of those
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
things are official or whatever you know
 
04:29:59.109 --> 04:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead um aside from the Liquor
 
04:30:00.550 --> 04:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
Commission are there any other
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
departments where that their unspent
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
revenue goes to the general fund but
 
04:30:13.269 --> 04:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
well no I mean Dees
 
04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't lapse to the general fund or
 
04:30:20.910 --> 04:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
something right I mean it's D collects a
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
fees sure they spend them and what they
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
have in excess would go to the general
 
04:30:29.229 --> 04:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
fund but we don't know what that figure
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
is okay yeah I guess that makes
 
04:30:37.550 --> 04:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
sense um Mr chair yes go ahead to I I
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
realize we don't have hb2 here and we're
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
waiting for it like oh oh wait do you
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
have an announcement breaking news yes
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
breaking news hb1 hb2 and hb25 are
 
04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
public and posted on the
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
website Jack and I will get you copies
 
04:30:58.269 --> 04:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
25 is the capital bu thank you yeah Jack
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
and I will you copy of those go home and
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
read them tonight so so for for me to
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
understand better what the situation is
 
04:31:09.550 --> 04:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
for our division it would be really
 
04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
helpful to know what of HB b
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
2 is in
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
hb1 so like the group two retirement I
 
04:31:22.590 --> 04:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not maybe you guys you probably know
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
the answer I I know that the municipal
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue sharing is
 
04:31:27.359 --> 04:31:29.070 align:start position:0%
Revenue sharing is
in

04:31:29.070 --> 04:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:31:32.790 --> 04:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
hb1 right so I think it would be just
 
04:31:35.670 --> 04:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
better to understand I can ask my
 
04:31:39.790 --> 04:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
opinion tomorrow when I see him does he
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
have a surplus statement that includes
 
04:31:45.269 --> 04:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
all of hb2 in it right which he may or
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
may not have yet so so at some point not
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
not too long we'll have a surplus
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
statement Surplus statement is what
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
changes hb1 via hb2 and other bills to
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
get to the actual bottom line right so
 
04:32:04.590 --> 04:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
so that's what we that's what you're
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
asking for basically basically yes well
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
because I just think we'd have a better
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
idea of what our what we're working with
 
04:32:11.520 --> 04:32:12.349 align:start position:0%
idea of what our what we're working with
absolutely

04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
if we knew that because those are both
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
Big Ticket items right and the well and
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
the original Surplus statement from the
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
governor really had nothing on it right
 
04:32:24.070 --> 04:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
there were no so so like for example the
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
group two
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
stuff is in here right the the something
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
it I mean the 5 million the first year
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the 28 million the second year it is
 
04:32:38.910 --> 04:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
it is we're not sure that that's what is
 
04:32:40.030 --> 04:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
reflected in
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
H2 well this is nodding at me go ahead
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
so yes it is in both places um I believe
 
04:32:50.830 --> 04:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
the governor was supposed to request it
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
to be taken out of hb2 because it was an
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
hb1 and I don't think that happened so
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
it'll probably need to be an amendment
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
that we do we being division one does to
 
04:33:02.950 --> 04:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 what we don't know what the question
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
is what the actual cost of the group to
 
04:33:08.510 --> 04:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
calculation is because as we heard from
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system that
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
figure did not come from them so what is
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
in hb1 is an estimate from the
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
governor's office but we need to verify
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
that what the actual expense of this
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
Bill yes the the retirement system does
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
not like working on something that's not
 
04:33:26.590 --> 04:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
an official draft right so now that we
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
have hb2 we can give them those pages
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
and then they can come up ask their
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
actuaries and give us whatever the real
 
04:33:36.470 --> 04:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
numbers so those two numbers are just
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah um You probably saw breaking
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
news too they add to Melissa that Ways
 
04:33:48.910 --> 04:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
and Means came out with their numbers
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
today yeah but I think I already had
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%
those right so did they
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
change Mela did they change there's $256
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:07.150 --> 04:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
26 the same yeah for 25 youan 26
 
04:34:09.629 --> 04:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
compared to 25
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
26 yeah yeah okay okay in any case yes I
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
think those are all the numbers that we
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
had um so um what I didn't hand out yet
 
04:34:25.390 --> 04:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
but we've talked about is
 
04:34:28.109 --> 04:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
um aside from
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
YDC the size that we're going to try to
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
cut in this division is something like
 
04:34:40.830 --> 04:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
65 million a year in order to get from
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
the governor's Revenue estimates to the
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means Revenue estimates
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay so that's kind of that's my the
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
ballpark of what I I understand what's
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
the figure about 65 million per year 66
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
million something like that
 
04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
um from the governor's budget the
 
04:35:05.629 --> 04:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
difference between the governor's budget
 
04:35:08.510 --> 04:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
and what house ways mean says we have
 
04:35:08.520 --> 04:35:09.390 align:start position:0%
and what house ways mean says we have
for

04:35:09.390 --> 04:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue okay um
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
now there's all kinds of ways to do
 
04:35:20.750 --> 04:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
stuff um and some of it is you know
 
04:35:24.869 --> 04:35:24.879 align:start position:0%
laying off people and and some of it
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
is um reducing grants and and other sort
 
04:35:34.109 --> 04:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
of outside spending and some of it
 
04:35:34.119 --> 04:35:35.670 align:start position:0%
of outside spending and some of it
is

04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:35:39.470 --> 04:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
um not giving back to towns as much as
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh as we would have otherwise
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
um but you know the the all the uses of
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
money uh some of it is Raising fees and
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
fines and and that kind of stuff right
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
and back of the budget stuff yeah back
 
04:35:55.869 --> 04:35:55.879 align:start position:0%
of the budget cuts you know well when we
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
make a cut we can make it specifically
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
to an accounting unit right um and
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's also General sorts of things so
 
04:36:05.830 --> 04:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
for example one of the things I'm
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
looking at is
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
um how many employees so Statewide
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's uh I now have a
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet with something like 20,000
 
04:36:23.070 --> 04:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
state employees on it okay um positions
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
not people you know I don't know names
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
but position and um and so I I know
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
who's who supervises who okay and so it
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
turns out there's a significant number
 
04:36:41.551 --> 04:36:41.561 align:start position:0%
of people on that list that super
 
04:36:44.670 --> 04:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
supervis one person okay and there's a
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
large number that supervis two people
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a large number that supervis
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
three people and the number of people
 
04:36:49.840 --> 04:36:50.830 align:start position:0%
three people and the number of people
who

04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:36:54.670 --> 04:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
supervise like five or more is
 
04:36:58.029 --> 04:36:58.039 align:start position:0%
small so you know the the general
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
structure management structure of state
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
government is
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
is you know fairly um fairly steep I
 
04:37:08.670 --> 04:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
guess if you want to think of it that
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
way as opposed to what a standard
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
organization might have of you know if
 
04:37:15.310 --> 04:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
you're a manager you manage 10 people or
 
04:37:16.910 --> 04:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
04:37:19.470 --> 04:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
now anyways so that's something we can
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
think about as kind of a general thing
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
is do we want to get you know fewer
 
04:37:28.830 --> 04:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
supervisors and make them more workers
 
04:37:31.869 --> 04:37:31.879 align:start position:0%
and less supervisors because it's to
 
04:37:34.670 --> 04:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
some extent it's a little bit of a trick
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
to get somebody paid more is to change
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
their title from your whatever to your
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
whatever supervisor right that gets you
 
04:37:46.990 --> 04:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
into a higher pay grade so you know
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's more of a general kind of thing
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
we can do to save money um yes go ahead
 
04:37:55.990 --> 04:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
actually delay delayering an
 
04:37:58.670 --> 04:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
organization as what you suggested is
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
actually a very good management practice
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
not just Financial because it drives
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
decision making to a lower level where
 
04:38:08.789 --> 04:38:08.799 align:start position:0%
those people are probably more able to
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
come to a solution I mean if if a
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
machine is broken the person that
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
operates the machine is probably going
 
04:38:18.109 --> 04:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
to know what needs to be done to fix it
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
than somebody to grade levels above them
 
04:38:21.869 --> 04:38:21.879 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's it would be a good
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
exercise yeah but it's but it's hard to
 
04:38:28.590 --> 04:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
do those would end up being sort of back
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
of the budget type things right that
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
says reduce your number of Supervisors
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
by you know X right you know this kind
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
of thing so um but anyways so there's
 
04:38:41.709 --> 04:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of ways to save money
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
um and we will be looking at them all so
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
you said 65 million per year so 130 for
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
the bayum something like that
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
yeah from division one and we are like
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
19% of of the general funds total okay
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
now um the biggest number we have I
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
think um besides Corrections so so and
 
04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
some of these are going to be very hard
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
to cut right because like Corrections
 
04:39:15.359 --> 04:39:16.109 align:start position:0%
to cut right because like Corrections
for

04:39:16.109 --> 04:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
example um they seem to come in with a
 
04:39:21.470 --> 04:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
very type budget right I mean they're
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's flat from what they're actually
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
spent last year and um I'm concerned
 
04:39:30.910 --> 04:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
that it's as I told them that it's
 
04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
unrealistic because because they
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
essentially took away all the all the um
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
um overtime that they were actually
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
using right they have like 40% of their
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
budget is overtime or something like
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
that and so yeah but she was going to
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
offset that with the UN un the vacant
 
04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
positions right and that that's a good
 
04:39:56.430 --> 04:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
strategy yeah it's reasonable right and
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
and we've been talking about for
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
example getting rid of uh liquor
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement right so there's there's
 
04:40:04.400 --> 04:40:05.350 align:start position:0%
enforcement right so there's there's
group

04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
group
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
two uh employees there that could become
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
corrections employees right and so you
 
04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
know that's another thing is I I think
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
we should take a hard look at group two
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
employees who are scattered around right
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
and and do they really need to be um you
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
know does every little Department well I
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how many do but what
 
04:40:30.750 --> 04:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
departments need a police force and what
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't right so I think uh maybe there's
 
04:40:37.230 --> 04:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
some in agriculture for example right
 
04:40:39.550 --> 04:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
that don't have to be there so send them
 
04:40:41.788 --> 04:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
all to Corrections
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
Corrections is hiring they have openings
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
they have openings yeah yeah there's no
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
question about it so I mean there's
 
04:40:50.070 --> 04:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
those are all kinds of things we have to
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
think about um all these new initiatives
 
04:40:55.830 --> 04:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh things we get in
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
bills um those are going to be hard to
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
fund you know I
 
04:41:02.350 --> 04:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
mean for every one of those things you
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
fund you have to cut yet more right in
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
another place yes represent
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
they so on the bail reform I remember
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
remember in the judicial branch I think
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
it was 1.8 million yes per
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
year is somebody
 
04:41:22.590 --> 04:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
calculating the difference in that cost
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
based if the provision that they are
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
voting out of committee passes do you
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
know what I'm trying to I really haven't
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
looked at that bill so I don't know yeah
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
but that might but yeah assum assum we
 
04:41:36.910 --> 04:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
get that bill it'll have a fiscal note
 
04:41:39.550 --> 04:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
and then we'll talk about it
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
I'm it it appears to me from what you
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
know the Judiciary was saying was that
 
04:41:47.550 --> 04:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
what we did last time didn't work very
 
04:41:51.470 --> 04:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
well specific well MoneyWise the the
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
money paid to the uh bail Commissioners
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
right remember they used to go and
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
collect them from from the accused
 
04:42:04.430 --> 04:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
directly right or or via their judge
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
right but now the uh Judiciary is paying
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners and then the
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
judici is is running after the um uh
 
04:42:18.270 --> 04:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
defendants to grab the money right and
 
04:42:20.350 --> 04:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
they're not doing a great job of it
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
right so they were saying they're
 
04:42:24.990 --> 04:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
getting you know they're they're getting
 
04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
a sixth or something of what they're of
 
04:42:30.190 --> 04:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
what they're being paid you know so so
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
that whole thing doesn't seem to be
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
working very well now maybe because it's
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
new I don't know but but you know that
 
04:42:38.590 --> 04:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
would be a significant chunk of this 1.8
 
04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
million that we might want to think
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
about 3.6 over the exactly because it's
 
04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
3.6 over the by any so you know um and I
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
don't think that's all bail commissioner
 
04:42:51.470 --> 04:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
I mean some of that is the magistrate
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
salary that was the other thing I was
 
04:42:55.510 --> 04:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
curious about because I didn't I don't
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
know if Melissa or Jack knew how that
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
broke down those numbers between the
 
04:43:03.440 --> 04:43:03.450 align:start position:0%
cost of the magistrates versus the bail
 
04:43:03.450 --> 04:43:04.830 align:start position:0%
cost of the magistrates versus the bail
[Music]

04:43:04.830 --> 04:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it's just like I don't
 
04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
know the top of my head
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
but I'd be curious to know I mean the
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
whole concept there was that we weren't
 
04:43:16.110 --> 04:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
getting as many bail Commissioners as we
 
04:43:18.670 --> 04:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
wanted right so therefore we hire a
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
magistrate so I don't
 
04:43:25.150 --> 04:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
know it wasn't well wasn't well received
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
by the
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
existing B
 
04:43:32.990 --> 04:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
commission yes and and uh turn on your
 
04:43:36.868 --> 04:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
microphone and we had a case recently
 
04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
where I believe it was one of the new
 
04:43:38.840 --> 04:43:41.350 align:start position:0%
where I believe it was one of the new
magistrates

04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
magistrates
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh there was some controversies about
 
04:43:44.120 --> 04:43:45.390 align:start position:0%
uh there was some controversies about
his

04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
performance yeah I I'd be right there
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
there was some you know big incident but
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
but I as I understand it later the judge
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
backed up that Magistrate's decision yes
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
right so therefore you know you can't
 
04:44:03.910 --> 04:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
you can't just run around making law
 
04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
based on one specific incident right you
 
04:44:09.070 --> 04:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
know so and and I thought the judicial
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
branch actually liked the Magistrate
 
04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
because it relieved the burden on a lot
 
04:44:15.868 --> 04:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
of the Judes yes and they much less
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
expensive than judges that's right so so
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
the key is how much staff do they have
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
and do they have to have quite so much
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
right so that's what I've been talking
 
04:44:29.390 --> 04:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
to people about because and and you
 
04:44:31.150 --> 04:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
remember you asked was it you that asked
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
the question of the governor yes and she
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
said they've got two parallel
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling sets of Staff right that that
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
could be could be merged and they could
 
04:44:44.550 --> 04:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
could find some uh savings so you know
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
there's there's that question as well
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
well and so the the other thing though
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
is as we're looking at all these
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
individual boards that provide
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
alternatives to going to
 
04:44:57.390 --> 04:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
court that if you didn't have those
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities there would be quite an
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
additional burden on the court
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
so the whole uh my whole sweater analogy
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
when you start I'm not arguing one way
 
04:45:10.030 --> 04:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
or the other I'm just saying we've got
 
04:45:13.110 --> 04:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
to look at the whole box wax sure and I
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
also Mr chair I also think that when we
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
look at the investment in diversion
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
programs that that's a wise decision
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
because there is a great expense when
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
someone's incarcerated so when we do
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
have opportunities for pro to fund
 
04:45:32.910 --> 04:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
programs that will lessen the amount
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
people that need bail or people that
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
need to be incarcerated I think that's
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's spending that's smart right and I
 
04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
would certainly consider a high
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
representative Smith do you come to
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
berate me
 
04:45:46.798 --> 04:45:48.628 align:start position:0%
berate me
or

04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
no okay um because I I think I did
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
something you may not have liked today
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
but anyway um already confessing yeah
 
04:45:59.788 --> 04:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
well I knew it at the time but anyways
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
um but I might be
 
04:46:06.030 --> 04:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
willing we we talked about for example
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
the the Thousand that separates a
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor from a felony right and
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
that's probably been there for who knows
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
how many years but I that's not
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
something I feel comfortable changing in
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
the budget right you know it could save
 
04:46:26.030 --> 04:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
us money right but but um that's a big
 
04:46:28.750 --> 04:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
deal I think right so that you know
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
maybe representative eel and I could
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor a bill next year or something
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
like that we could look at it I mean
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'll send you the article he made a it
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
was the head of the office of the public
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
defender and it just shows you again
 
04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
using the sweater theory if you change a
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
little something here it can Ripple all
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
through the system because you didn't
 
04:46:52.830 --> 04:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
need as many Defenders you you know less
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
burden on the judicial branch maybe less
 
04:46:55.440 --> 04:46:56.750 align:start position:0%
burden on the judicial branch maybe less
people

04:46:56.750 --> 04:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
incarcerated it was I don't know it just
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
really struck me but it wouldn't be I
 
04:47:04.270 --> 04:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
mean we do have President especially in
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
the last couple terms of putting in
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
those kind of policy things in the
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
budget so it it it's something I don't
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
think we should discount if we know that
 
04:47:17.708 --> 04:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to have savings um but um
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
there you know another thing that came
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
up I think in the judicial branch it
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
came up when we were discussing um
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative walner bill regarding
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
Waypoint is um maybe running a pilot
 
04:47:33.230 --> 04:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me or investing in a pilot for
 
04:47:35.310 --> 04:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
the young adult court because that's
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
been shown to be a good
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
diversion um you know and I I think it
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
it might might be you know it it may
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
cost a probationary officer but other
 
04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
than that I think that's something we
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
should look at even though it's an add
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
to the budget it would actually
 
04:47:53.708 --> 04:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
decrease um the number of people who
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:47:57.070 --> 04:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and not just on the short
 
04:47:59.070 --> 04:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
term but the long term too so just
 
04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay be an adjunct of the Judiciary
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
Committee um could I just suggest Mr
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
chair for hb2 on Friday it would I don't
 
04:48:13.390 --> 04:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
I don't well also it will be Wednesday
 
04:48:15.868 --> 04:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
morning right we're doing hp2 well I was
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
thinking so we should have them I I was
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about the dees part on the SEC
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee and and
 
04:48:26.750 --> 04:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
the permitting it would be good to hear
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
from them some sort of concept of the
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
related costs because that's not really
 
04:48:35.628 --> 04:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
I mean I saw fee
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
increases right and then we saw I think
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the governor added 275
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
,000 for the permitting I think that was
 
04:48:47.230 --> 04:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
it so I think I don't know I'm just
 
04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get a better understanding
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and then on that permitting thing
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned to you it does involve
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
dncr and fishing game so somebody from
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
those agencies I think should be here
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
for the discussion yeah because it it's
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
their employees that are getting pulled
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
so Melissa are you when yours when we
 
04:49:10.990 --> 04:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
should we try to kind of group group
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
things in in in the house build 2 and
 
04:49:17.230 --> 04:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
get appropriate agency here when it's a
 
04:49:18.830 --> 04:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
significant item I mean there some of
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
these things are little tiny things like
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
like the treasurer mentioned right we
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't really need anybody back but other
 
04:49:28.708 --> 04:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
things are pages and Pages worth PES and
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
Pages yeah so we've tried to Jack and I
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
have tried to coordinate that um for
 
04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
instance on Friday we have Dees coming
 
04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
in we do know division 2 will talk with
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
fishing game on their portion of it um
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
if you want to invite them in I would
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
just say the chair probably should
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
correspond with representative F yeah
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'll do that to discuss that see them
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um Wednesday you talked about
 
04:49:50.830 --> 04:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
retirement talking about retirement so
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
we're inviting retirement in because
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's important for them to discuss that
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
piece even though they won't have a cost
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
yet they will be able to talk about some
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
of the comparisons and differences so
 
04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
typically if we think we're going to
 
04:50:05.548 --> 04:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
tackle a subject and it's outside the
 
04:50:07.868 --> 04:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
expertise that Jack and I can provide
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
then we would invite an agency in if
 
04:50:11.070 --> 04:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's something that we can get the
 
04:50:12.910 --> 04:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
information or we know what it does then
 
04:50:14.350 --> 04:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
we don't invite the agency in and we
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
just vote on it as is sure so do you
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
think we have the capacity as far as the
 
04:50:23.470 --> 04:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
permitting issues to think about dncr
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
without dncr a staff person being here I
 
04:50:29.150 --> 04:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
mean because it's their employees that
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
are getting all I was thinking is if we
 
04:50:35.070 --> 04:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
do hb2 with Dees on Friday afternoon if
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
we start with the permitting thing maybe
 
04:50:39.628 --> 04:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
somebody we could ask them if they want
 
04:50:42.430 --> 04:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
to be here maybe some somebody from dncr
 
04:50:44.510 --> 04:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
and fishing game would just like to be
 
04:50:46.830 --> 04:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
here for the discussion I I'm really
 
04:50:50.910 --> 04:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
struggling to understand how we Gap
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
understand the whole picture here if we
 
04:50:54.430 --> 04:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the input of the other
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
agencies I mean we always can invite
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
anybody in that you guys feel is
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to come in how we even I mean
 
04:51:03.270 --> 04:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
DS is the recipient of all these things
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
I don't know how the others feel about
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
it yeah so we can invite dncr and like I
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
said fishing game I would probably just
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
request the chair to speak to
 
04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative Earth to make sure we're
 
04:51:15.868 --> 04:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
sort of not sipping on anybody's toes or
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
any division's toes if they we want to
 
04:51:19.868 --> 04:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
invite their agencies in to speak with
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
us and we also don't we do not have to
 
04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
complete it all on Friday so if we have
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
Dees in and then we need another day we
 
04:51:28.948 --> 04:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
always can schedule another day or
 
04:51:30.430 --> 04:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
another time slot for additional
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions I I don't know how much there
 
04:51:34.230 --> 04:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I know fishing game is over there
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
today so I don't know how much they
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
would have talked about this but they're
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
not digging into hb2 yet they're doing
 
04:51:41.230 --> 04:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
budget work right now
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay I don't want to make a big de it's
 
04:51:46.350 --> 04:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
just it's a multiple pages of this
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
document y represent thank you Mr chair
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
do we know what the schedule's going to
 
04:51:54.628 --> 04:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
be like next week just plan on
 
04:51:57.628 --> 04:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
essentially Monday Wednesday Friday from
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
for every day for the March in March
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay um and they probably will be the
 
04:52:08.430 --> 04:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
when we get to the end and have to vote
 
04:52:10.590 --> 04:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
in the main committee that could easily
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
be Tuesday to yeah and do we know
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
anything about the public hearing for
 
04:52:19.350 --> 04:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
hb1 and two what the so I think we made
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
the assumption that it may be on the
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
12th um we don't have full confirmation
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
of that Janet just got notification of
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
the hb2 so she works on scheduling that
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
with representative wer yeah I haven't
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
heard so will you be making I'm sure
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it so I I have a
 
04:52:36.430 --> 04:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
regular meeting with the other chairs
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
and my K on Tuesday Mornings so um I'm
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
sure that'll be tomorrow morning
 
04:52:44.670 --> 04:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning exactly so so should we
 
04:52:47.230 --> 04:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
request hb2 copies or you guys going to
 
04:52:49.708 --> 04:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
have them made we will get copies for
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
you and as well um for those you have
 
04:52:53.150 --> 04:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
been on the committee in the past Jack
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
and I will go through and index it for
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
division one items only so we don't
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
cover other divisions but we do make an
 
04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
index of the sections we need to cover
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
because we need to make sure we vote on
 
04:53:04.270 --> 04:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
those in the end of what we're doing
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
with them and we'll keep track of
 
04:53:08.830 --> 04:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
that so we'll look online tonight and
 
04:53:11.708 --> 04:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
then we'll have one in the morning
 
04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
if it's available I think
 
04:53:16.750 --> 04:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's sometime tomorrow sometime okay
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
sometime tomorrow the issue I was I'll
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
just mention with with representative
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
Smith um there's a bill in um Judiciary
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the office of Cost
 
04:53:32.310 --> 04:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
Containment so this is related to the
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
judicial Council because when people get
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
a um when they're Indigent and they get
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
an attorney
 
04:53:41.120 --> 04:53:41.830 align:start position:0%
an attorney
the

04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:43.830 --> 04:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
money they actually are sort of
 
04:53:45.150 --> 04:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
borrowing the money they're not
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily given it and and so there's
 
04:53:50.430 --> 04:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
a there's an office called the office of
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment which tries to recover
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
the some of these costs and what
 
04:53:58.948 --> 04:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
happened was over the years and and they
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
used to be profitable in the sense that
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the cost of the agency was much
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
less than the amount they were bringing
 
04:54:09.868 --> 04:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
in you know they were bringing in a
 
04:54:11.350 --> 04:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
couple million dollar a year or
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
something and but a few years a like
 
04:54:21.310 --> 04:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
2020 we changed the law such that people
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
who were
 
04:54:29.390 --> 04:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
innocent uh didn't have to pay back okay
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
and um so the whole thing not that that
 
04:54:36.150 --> 04:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
many people are found innocent right
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
very few are but but what the the result
 
04:54:46.510 --> 04:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
was that um and they don't check very
 
04:54:50.430 --> 04:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
much exactly how Indigent people are
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
right and so um and so the result was
 
04:54:56.708 --> 04:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
that their revenue dropped off
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
considerably based on that change to the
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
law and um so it it it has dropped to
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
the point where the cost of the office
 
04:55:08.830 --> 04:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
is slightly greater than the cost what
 
04:55:11.070 --> 04:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're bringing in so representative
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
Smith and others put in a bill why don't
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
we just get rid of this office and in
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
fact the governor did in the budget if
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the budget but
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn complained to me
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
that that um he doesn't think it's right
 
04:55:30.868 --> 04:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
for people who
 
04:55:30.878 --> 04:55:33.670 align:start position:0%
for people who
are

04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:55:36.990 --> 04:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
um people do owe this the the cost of
 
04:55:40.350 --> 04:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
their attorneys right I mean if if if an
 
04:55:43.470 --> 04:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
if a well-to-do person is accused of
 
04:55:46.270 --> 04:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
something goes to court you know hires
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
an attorney goes to court is found
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
innocent and so on they still owe their
 
04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
attorney I mean it's just that's one of
 
04:55:56.750 --> 04:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
the costs of life and so uh he thinks
 
04:55:58.590 --> 04:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of the costs of life you know
 
04:56:00.990 --> 04:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
we this bill that representative Smith
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
had I just all Yes um so representative
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
Lyn and myself made an amendment to
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
Simply undo the thing that was done in
 
04:56:17.948 --> 04:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
2020 so that this office of Cost
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
Containment could now be profitable back
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
again right could be
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
put well it was at some
 
04:56:27.230 --> 04:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
point it won't be now people can't pay
 
04:56:29.750 --> 04:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
they can't pay so they don't pay I don't
 
04:56:31.350 --> 04:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
care how much you harass them they can't
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
collect the money well somehow they used
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
to pay well they used to but it hasn't
 
04:56:38.430 --> 04:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
for years and we're spending a lot of
 
04:56:41.190 --> 04:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
money trying to get money that and
 
04:56:43.390 --> 04:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
Charlie Arling house is completely in
 
04:56:46.590 --> 04:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
favor of getting rid of this Cost
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
Containment and it's going to cost us
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
money Dan it it has
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
and uh it's something I think we can do
 
04:56:55.548 --> 04:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
without because if somebody doesn't have
 
04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
the money they don't have the money is
 
04:56:59.788 --> 04:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
you can keep chasing them and spend a
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
ton of money on lawyers for the state
 
04:57:04.990 --> 04:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well eventually they turn all I
 
04:57:08.430 --> 04:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
have on my side is history I mean old
 
04:57:10.590 --> 04:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
history what do they do after a year not
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
that old do they turn it over to a
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
collections agency you know what do they
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
do yeah well they are the collection
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
agents that's what but they're Lo
 
04:57:22.788 --> 04:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
they've been losing money for over a can
 
04:57:24.110 --> 04:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
they put the person in jail for not
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
paying right they won't but the point is
 
04:57:28.830 --> 04:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
if you read the fiscal note on this bill
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
it says due to previous legislative
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
changes the amount collected by this dat
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
has declined over the years well so this
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill can undo those previous legislative
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
changes anyway so that's what this whole
 
04:57:46.750 --> 04:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
thing was that's why you got the look Mr
 
04:57:48.670 --> 04:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I got the
 
04:57:51.310 --> 04:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
look it sounds like a part-time job that
 
04:57:54.030 --> 04:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
could be done by an existing employee in
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
the Justice Department not a number of
 
04:57:58.030 --> 04:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers which are on the payroll now
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's I think three or four
 
04:58:03.708 --> 04:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
people and uh but you know they used to
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
collect couple million dollars
 
04:58:06.160 --> 04:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
collect couple million dollars
so

04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
anyway that's that's the the whole
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
question so that bill if it passes will
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
come to us I guess we will see but I
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
think if nothing is done right if the
 
04:58:21.040 --> 04:58:22.510 align:start position:0%
think if nothing is done right if the
bill

04:58:22.510 --> 04:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:58:22.520 --> 04:58:25.070 align:start position:0%
bill
fails

04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
fails
 
04:58:27.670 --> 04:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
then then it's out of the budget it's
 
04:58:32.670 --> 04:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
so no but if you look at 26 27 all is
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
zeros so the governor took it out so it
 
04:58:42.830 --> 04:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
must be in house Bill too this bill the
 
04:58:44.350 --> 04:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
the fact of this bill must be in the
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
notes oh it's not so the budget just
 
04:58:56.270 --> 04:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
assumed that this bill was going to pass
 
04:58:58.030 --> 04:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
I mean that's kind of weird I think when
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house uh came in
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is what he said that they
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
assumed and if something different were
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
to come of it then we'd need to add
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:16.830 --> 04:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's but I'm going to assume Revenue
 
04:59:20.548 --> 04:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
then I appreciate your
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
optimism you can't get blood out of a
 
04:59:25.310 --> 04:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
stone more
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
turn all right we'll give you we'll give
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
Melissa a project of what what was the
 
04:59:31.350 --> 04:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
revenue that the office of Cost
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
Containment made in 2019 or prior to
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:42.788 --> 04:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
so we have a slug of bills on Wednesday
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll see yeah I mean if if a if a um
 
04:59:51.510 --> 04:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor comes in here and even though
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
we're here there's it's coming here you
 
04:59:55.548 --> 04:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
know some of these bills come and
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal effect at all if we
 
05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
like them can we just send them their on
 
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
their merry way without retraining
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
them yeah so the whole strategy with
 
05:00:10.270 --> 05:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
bills is a question right so um we'll
 
05:00:12.070 --> 05:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
have to see what they are we'll have to
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
see what they are yeah we have to read
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
on there was quite a there's quite a few
 
05:00:22.110 --> 05:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
of them yes these all bills that pass
 
05:00:24.910 --> 05:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
the house yes we're going to get more
 
05:00:28.510 --> 05:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get lots more yeah
 
05:00:30.070 --> 05:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's just I was just thinking I think
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
we're up to about nine or 10
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I like some of your suggestions on
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
here but which leads me to a question Mr
 
05:00:42.150 --> 05:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
chair now what we retained what four or
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
five bills some of them have significant
 
05:00:48.430 --> 05:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
ask and are you going to assume that
 
05:00:50.590 --> 05:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
we're just going to dispense with those
 
05:00:53.310 --> 05:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
since we already know we're $65 million
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
shy is that your plan or yes I mean you
 
05:00:59.708 --> 05:00:59.718 align:start position:0%
know there's the $100,000 for the
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture thing I mean I don't know
 
05:01:04.990 --> 05:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that 50,000 50,000 I
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
we can offset it we can do it let's work
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
on getting the 65 down first
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
yeah see where we're at but I don't
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
think we can afford any of retirement
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
or but but what I'm concerned about
 
05:01:20.480 --> 05:01:21.628 align:start position:0%
or but but what I'm concerned about
there

05:01:21.628 --> 05:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
is what we did two years ago kind of
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
assumed we would be keep paying for 10
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
years are we all of a sudden going to
 
05:01:32.590 --> 05:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
say let's just put it on the towns you
 
05:01:35.470 --> 05:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
know youum whatever you want each each
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has to vote on everything
 
05:01:39.310 --> 05:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
separately you can't vote for future
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
legisl that's right yeah repr brellas is
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct you can't and then
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
there's the YDC thing right I mean well
 
05:01:49.110 --> 05:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
we know that's going to be a $75 million
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
hit no matter what but it's but it's not
 
05:01:53.310 --> 05:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
here I know it's not
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
there they're going to have to stretch
 
05:01:56.910 --> 05:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
what they got for this
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
year we
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
H oh yeah we we You' you you have a a
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
draft Yeah so what is the what's What's
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
the total money oh MoneyWise no we don't
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
think that there's much there at all
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
right they're going to figure it out
 
05:02:17.390 --> 05:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
they they'll figure it out and I may get
 
05:02:20.590 --> 05:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
the number tomorrow morning but but
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
um we don't think there's much number
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's much of a number there um now
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
one big thing in hb2 is the video
 
05:02:30.200 --> 05:02:31.270 align:start position:0%
one big thing in hb2 is the video
Lottery

05:02:31.270 --> 05:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
terminals right and so
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
um that's a big question mark cuz cuz we
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from way Ways and Means
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
about that Revenue right they they
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
included didn't they in their they have
 
05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
their own bill they haven't yet exected
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
as far as I
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
know um and from their point of view
 
05:02:59.310 --> 05:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill so oh come on
 
05:03:00.990 --> 05:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
guys it has
 
05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
to yeah so I've asked them to treat it
 
05:03:07.948 --> 05:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
like an early bill but we'll see
 
05:03:10.548 --> 05:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
so huh
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
that would go to lottery so that would
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
be division too oh than God at this
 
05:03:17.070 --> 05:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
point it's a self-fulfilling prophecy
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
because they the governor's already said
 
05:03:22.110 --> 05:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
not that they're going to get the money
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think I see any way they're
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to get 100 they're not going to
 
05:03:26.910 --> 05:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
get 127 million the first year there's
 
05:03:29.470 --> 05:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
no way not with everybody going Foxwoods
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
and moan son but that's not what the
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
budget says the budget says 10 million
 
05:03:36.750 --> 05:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
05:03:39.270 --> 05:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
117 the second year yeah but I still
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
don't think going to get 117 second year
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
but at this point they've almost they've
 
05:03:44.990 --> 05:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
committed to it so the bill is going to
 
05:03:47.548 --> 05:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
get passed by the house and the Senate
 
05:03:51.390 --> 05:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
it no they may not have my vote but
 
05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to pass it I know that you
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
think so yeah I think so they have to
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's like at this point he's committed
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's like there 117 million on the
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
second year that but they have to have
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of details there
 
05:04:09.480 --> 05:04:10.548 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of details there
that

05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:12.548 --> 05:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
different members of the House are
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about and like I'm concerned
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
about it I wouldn't I might not vote for
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
it necessarily but a lot of the pressure
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be we need this Revenue the
 
05:04:23.310 --> 05:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
pressure is going to be there so right
 
05:04:25.390 --> 05:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
but some people think that the revenue
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
she put in is unrealistic in particular
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
the split between the operator and the
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
um and the state and the Charities is
 
05:04:39.150 --> 05:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
all quite different than than current
 
05:04:40.990 --> 05:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
practice the mafia usually wants a
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
bigger cut yeah so I don't think we're
 
05:04:46.230 --> 05:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
GNA get 45% or what yeah yeah well who's
 
05:04:48.990 --> 05:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
the mafia in this situation right
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
somebody is it the state
 
05:04:50.718 --> 05:04:52.868 align:start position:0%
somebody is it the state
somebody

05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
I and there's and there's likely to be a
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment or two making it a
 
05:05:02.110 --> 05:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for some special purpose
 
05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
well yeah I mean I personally think it
 
05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
should simply go to the education trust
 
05:05:08.320 --> 05:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
should simply go to the education trust
fund

05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
consider it like all gambling right and
 
05:05:14.830 --> 05:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
then and then we adjust we can adjust
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
the the other splits that go to the
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
education trust fund don't you mean
 
05:05:20.788 --> 05:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
general fund you should go to general
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
fund and then we can no I think if you
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
want to be clean with the Constitution
 
05:05:28.628 --> 05:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
just put all gambling money in the
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and be done with it
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
but there's all kinds of other money
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
that goes the education trust and
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to right so does the
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution say all again money must no
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
it says it says lottery I believe right
 
05:05:44.718 --> 05:05:46.190 align:start position:0%
it says it says lottery I believe right
and

05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:50.548 --> 05:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
so you know so yeah but just to make it
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
you you know I mean it's a New Concept I
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
mean it's quite you know this stuff is
 
05:06:05.708 --> 05:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
silly um I mean this part of the
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution is a little bit silly right
 
05:06:10.230 --> 05:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
because because a dollar here
 
05:06:11.750 --> 05:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know every dollar is the same as
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
another dollar right and so the fact
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
that this dollar went for that purpose
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know well what about that
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
dollar can go to this purpose you know
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
what I mean a TR it's not a trust fund
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it sounds it sounds good but
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know in reality it's that's why we
 
05:06:33.628 --> 05:06:33.638 align:start position:0%
always talk about General and education
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
funds in one phrase right because they
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
really are the same okay all right
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
but but they're non-aps so um that's
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
another another thing okay any other
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
things we want to talk about in general
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
before we go caucus I mean I just think
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be watching bills to see
 
05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
what effect they may make changes that
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
might pass through the the um budget
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
right so there was remember when we were
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the new the Paid Family
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
Leave they were talking about a bill
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
that was going to remove the marketing
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
from their responsibilities which was
 
05:07:11.120 --> 05:07:12.750 align:start position:0%
from their responsibilities which was
about

05:07:12.750 --> 05:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
$500,000 so we'll see if that comes
 
05:07:16.750 --> 05:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
through Commerce do you remember that
 
05:07:19.868 --> 05:07:19.878 align:start position:0%
say that again so on the New Hampshire
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
Paid Family Leave we were when we were
 
05:07:25.470 --> 05:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the New Hampshire Paid
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
Family Leave With Das we were looking at
 
05:07:30.030 --> 05:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
their budget and part of their
 
05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility is marketing the program
 
05:07:35.190 --> 05:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
remember and there was I thought there
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
was something like
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
$500,000 in there for marketing yes we
 
05:07:42.548 --> 05:07:42.558 align:start position:0%
were asking about that but then she said
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
there was a bill in Commerce that she I
 
05:07:50.788 --> 05:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
don't that they may um remove the
 
05:07:50.798 --> 05:07:52.910 align:start position:0%
don't that they may um remove the
promotion

05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
05:07:56.270 --> 05:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of Das for
 
05:07:59.310 --> 05:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
that as part of a bill and then we may
 
05:08:02.110 --> 05:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
get that yes and that would be quite a
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
bit of money right there yeah so there
 
05:08:07.548 --> 05:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
may be other bills like that we'll see
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
sure yeah there may be some bills well
 
05:08:12.750 --> 05:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
for example there's a bill to get rid of
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
the U consumer Advocate right right so
 
05:08:20.510 --> 05:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
if that bill passes all federal funds um
 
05:08:24.788 --> 05:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
no it's other funds that go to rate
 
05:08:27.548 --> 05:08:27.558 align:start position:0%
payers the rate payers would benefit the
 
05:08:30.270 --> 05:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
rate payers would benefit yeah well well
 
05:08:32.548 --> 05:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
the rid payers benefit by his um
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
well yeah so the you know that's the
 
05:08:39.760 --> 05:08:43.390 align:start position:0%
well yeah so the you know that's the
theory

05:08:43.390 --> 05:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah um okay other any other
 
05:08:48.070 --> 05:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
