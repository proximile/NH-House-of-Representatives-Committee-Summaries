commission um
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
as you probably know the whet commiss
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
statue Memorial was dedicated in 19 U
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
2017 and it's to our late Governor the
 
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
ambassador to England dur World War II
 
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.270 align:start position:0%
ambassador to England dur World War II
and

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
um the committee
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
private funding our committee raised
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
over $300,000 for the wet Memorial and
 
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
in a way I look at the memorial of
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
course primarily being to honor Governor
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
wet for his service to our state and to
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
our country he was also the first
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
director of the Social
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
Security um Administration that's why
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
our social security numbers are
 
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.110 align:start position:0%
our social security numbers are
01002

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
01002
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
003 in fact Governor W was supposed to
 
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.510 align:start position:0%
003 in fact Governor W was supposed to
get

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
00101001 as the chair of that commission
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
and being a humble man he said no I'll
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
just take whatever randomly and that
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
went to a woman here in caret so that's
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
my trivia for the day but
 
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
um the memorial is dedicated to Governor
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
wet but in my heart it's also dedicated
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
to a good friend of many of us um the
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
fmer commissioner uh van McLoud from the
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
cultural Affairs I chaired the wiet
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee that you with a lot of help
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
from a lot of people we raised the money
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
and but if anybody was the chair a vice
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
chair it was vanan and he died when we
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
had about 90% of the work
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
done and uh so if you look at the
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
memorial and look to the left there's a
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
small plaque there uh dedicated to Van
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
where it's his words after every wi and
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
upward and um and those were engraved
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
next to the memorial as our way of
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
thanking van for everything he did uh
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
individually and as a commissioner of
 
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.790 align:start position:0%
individually and as a commissioner of
cultural

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
resources the commission is made up of
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
three people
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
myself uh Paul Smith the uh Clerk and
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
Terry Johnson from the New Hampshire
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
Department of historical
 
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
resources and we have not met and I
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
think in some ways this committee may
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
look at that as being a negative or you
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything uh since the
 
00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:47.879 align:start position:0%
dedication because nothing has needed to
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
be done um I myself look at the Statue
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
and it's being maintained it's in good
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
shape the purpose for having this in
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
part in the
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
legislation is that and I wrote this to
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
my friend I think it's in your records
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
now the email I sent to my friend from
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
Deary I have seen over the years a
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
number of times when the department of
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
AD Administration has not received
 
00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
funding they probably should have gotten
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
but didn't and we've seen a lot of our
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
cultural and historic properties degrade
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
over the years um such as the um Robert
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
Frost Farm in
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
Terry uh the um Wentworth uh cool
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
mansion in the Sea Coast and the Janu
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
Webster farm and now in Salsbury
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
originally in web in Franklin and those
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
who have heard I wanted to make sure at
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
least during my lifetime that if
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
anything happened to this statue or or
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
the Shrubbery or anything that the state
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
for some reason could not take care of
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
that this group would raise the money we
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
already have about 5,000 on hand but
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
raise any additional funds to make sure
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
that that was maintained uh I'm so proud
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
of the number of out of state people
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we have coming to our state house
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
to visit and many of them include the
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
statue of uh John wet and especially
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
those coming from England where he
 
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.069 align:start position:0%
those coming from England where he
served

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
served
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
so closely with the British people
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
refusing to leave London during the
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
blitz it would actually go out and help
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
the fire brigades go to the rubble
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
looking for the injured and the deceased
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
um in some respects John wiet is more
 
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
known and even probably better loved in
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
England than he is here and I've been
 
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
out there times when English visitors
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
have been and to oh God bless John wet
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
um so anyway that concludes all I had to
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
say to this group but I do hope you will
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
vote against it if it's a question of
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
taking it away and not to take it away
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
from this commission but I know it does
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
say the member of a house uh needs to be
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
on this group and if that is something
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
um that I could put a bill in to change
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than glad to and let me just
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
close by giving you my suggestion I know
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with the effect of
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
all these bills and I know you're trying
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with the cause and I think part
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the problem we have in the
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is no matter if a person
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they put in for a bill it's
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
going to get filed some could file a
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
bill saying make the TIY fly the state
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
insect of New Hampshire I need a
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
commission to look at this and in
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
instead of telling him that we don't
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
have TI flies in New Hampshire or
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative sure filed that four
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
years ago and it didn't
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
pass I would like to see a Sixers
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
commission a committee in the speakers
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
office like the speaker's Advisory Group
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
three Democrats three Republicans and if
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
anybody puts in a bill to form a
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
commission it would go before this six
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
person group first and in order to get a
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill to go to OS after that you need a
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
60% a 60% vote of the six people so four
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
out of six if it fails then like going
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
to uh toile a laate pill go to the floor
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
of the house and ask permission there I
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
think we have a lot of our new people
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
that think I would have put a bill in
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
for a commissioner on this and that not
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
realizing that one may have been done
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
just a couple sessions ago but I'd like
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
to see that check in Balance so that we
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't get so many of these bills coming
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
in and somehow and some of them I'm
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
surprised how they actually came into
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
law and and now you're suffering the
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
consequences of it that's all I've got
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman any questions I'd be glad to
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
answer them any any questions from the
 
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.269 align:start position:0%
answer them any any questions from the
committee

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.550 align:start position:0%
committee
comments

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in representative
 
00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
shff uh thank you for giving us your
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
point of view as well well as the
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
history of what's going on yeah in um
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
2012 and 2013 we had legislation to uh
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
2015 we had a bill come before us
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
establishing the commission so it's what
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
eight years ago um and you say the
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
commission has met since then and you've
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
raised money since then and I noticed in
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bills that
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
passed if you uh in the um it says this
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
bill establishes a committee to study
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
the construction of a permanent Memorial
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
to Governor John Gilbert winant on State
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
Property other than the State House
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
grounds and wouldn't you know it's just
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
across the street at the library and uh
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
in a very prominent position um I'm
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
wondering I also have the legislation
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
that established the joint legislative
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
historic committee and the
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the historic
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee and it wasn't too many years
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
ago when we had all of the statues
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
around the state house inspected we had
 
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
to do a repair to the large one behind
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
the state house water was coming out of
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
the foot so had to do some repairs and
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
then the term that was used was this um
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
company from Massachusetts waxed the
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
statues I think it's just a rubbing on
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
of a compound it's not necessarily wax
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
because that didn't make sense um with
 
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
the governor wian statue just across the
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
street I'm wondering if it might make
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
sense to include it in responsibilities
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
of the joint historic committee so that
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
when these statues get inspected and
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
taken care of that on will too just just
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
wondering what do you think I thank my
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
friend my friend from uh uh seast to who
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
to ask me that
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to see it stay in the W
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
commission hands because these the
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
people that have real vested interests
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
in the Statue um I suppose to put it
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
under the historic commission would be
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
fine I'd have no objection I just want
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
oversight um you know I remember I think
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
it was 10 years ago there was a
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
beautiful Victorian Cottage on the
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
grounds of the New Hampshire
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
hospital now the John wi yeah John
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
Gallen um office complex it was not
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
being used by the state so it was left
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
to abandon for in for six months the
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
water the pipes
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
froze and by the time they found it six
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
months later there black mole they had
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
te that beautiful old Cottage down I
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
just don't want to see things like the
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
Shrubbery should die and the state say
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
well we got to put our resources where
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
we get the mo we'll let it go you know
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
the sharberry represents sharberry that
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
grows in New Hampshire as well as in
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
England as part of the silent tribute to
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
the governor um those are the things I
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
want to make somebody should hit the
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
lamp for some reason and that breaks
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
that that would be taken care of and not
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
put off for another time but if the you
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
know I've got a lot of respect for the
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
historic uh joint historic committee and
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
uh that would be fine I'd have no
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
problem with that either
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead I just want to say thank
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
you very much and thanks for
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%

is near and dear to your heart so thank
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank which way does it go okay
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh coming uh
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff my recollection
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
is that when we were working on this in
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
the previous committee on committees we
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
had um we had a a memorial like this I
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
think it was to the police or it was to
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
safety or something and that was a
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
similar situation where when the bill
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
was originally passed it had to do with
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the commission being pulled together to
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
construct something and it was easy
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
enough I mean I think we included in our
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill language that basically showed the
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
evolution of the situation got rid of
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
the language that talked about the
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
construction of the item what I'm sorry
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm forgetting what Memorial was and it
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
simply said that the commission would um
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
continue and its responsibility would be
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance and continued
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
support of the memorial so it reflected
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
the rea the um reality of the situation
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
and it basically was just updating the
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
statute so I don't have the language in
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
front of me but it might be easy and
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
enough to just include something like
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
that in our bill our Amendment because
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself at this point I
 
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
would see I I would respect the request
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
of Representative or speaker shirtliff
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
and not repeal this commission but we
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
could do a simple update of the
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
language any other I think that was the
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement memorial out in front of
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
the Lop that you're referring to we did
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
form an early committee uh uh a study to
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
look at this idea of farming a memorial
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
and we did our report at the end saying
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
that we concluded that a memorial should
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
be done to honor Ambassador wet and um
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
and out of that a private uh group came
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
together because it was all private
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
fundraising for it uh there was no State
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
expense as far as the upkeep maintenance
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
having we talked to our uh Chief of
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
Staff uh you know talking to Terry it's
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
SP the understand that the state you
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
know maintains it like everything else
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
but this is part of the original bill
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
this uh oversight commission and again
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's just a fail safe um in the event
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
that for some reason the state can't do
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
what may need to be done um like I said
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know that really means a lot to
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
me that to a lot of people for so many
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
reasons you know for the governor
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
struggle with mental health problems uh
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
his Service uh um you know like his say
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
his late son Rivington wet once said to
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh Bill Gardner the farmer Secretary of
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
State he said my father will never
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
receive the honors and recognition he
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
deserves because of the way he died and
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
he took his own life in November of
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
1947 and um and the dedication that made
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
me feel so good he had since passed on
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
Rivington to know he's looking down and
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
saying yeah your father has been on it
 
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and what he suffered with his own
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
mental health problems is one of wasn't
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
a detriment it was one of the things
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
that he uh he should be out of his
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
father for in the way he handled things
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
so that was a long long answer to a
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
short question I apologize yes
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you and thank you for coming
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
and for sharing all of that I um I just
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
want to say what my thinking is as we go
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
through all of these committees and
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
commissions is that we don't want to
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
just get rid of them just to get rid of
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
them or just to say here's another one
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
we can cut you know we really want to
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
look at how um we've looked at how time
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
and resource intensive a commission or
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
committee is for staff you know that's
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
kind of one of the things we've been
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about and and uh just trying to
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
remember that some of these committees
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
and commissions um it's really good and
 
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
fine if they don't have work to do at a
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
certain period but that doesn't mean
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have other work to do in the
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
future and we shouldn't drop that off
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
and and leave it um and so I feel
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
like those two things that have been in
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
my mind um really apply in this
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
situation you know it's not a time and
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
resource intensive committee or
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
commission that the staff F would find
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
burdensome you know and it's not um so
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
huge that you can never get people
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
together you know and it's uh only six
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
years old so it's just not going to have
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
a ton of Maintenance at this point to be
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
frank um so it really is a future
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
oriented commission um so I just wanted
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
to let the um let folks know what I'm
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
kind of thinking of when I look at this
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
commission and the um work that it uh
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
does thank you
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
um assuming that's our final comment on
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
particular item let let me say that
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
um my recommendation is out also out of
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
deference to uh former
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
speaker I think that what I want to
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
recommend to the committee is that we
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
maybe moving this under the oaces or the
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
control of the historic uh
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
committee however not now yeah let's
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
let uh former speaker shirle think about
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
that and maybe communicate that thought
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
with the uh the folks that have been
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
working on with you on this and that if
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
we could bring it we could take it off
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
our list now and put a uh a bookmark on
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
this maybe a future action maybe we
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
bring it up through the rules committee
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we added as a a special legislation
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
if it if it's appropriate to do it that
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
way uh and and not included on this list
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
of 10 or so and uh let's Let It rest and
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
we'll think about it how does that thank
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for your kind words and
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
and your thoughts and it's greatly
 
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
appreciated by me without been speaking
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
to the other two members I think to move
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
it to the historical commission The
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
Joint historical commission would be
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
fine with them as well as it is with me
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
just that the fact that somebody else is
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
looking over the statue and it's uh and
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
people especially connected with the
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislature you know here I go again
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
John winer's first uh position was
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire house for W7
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
in conet and long as there's more eyes
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
on it that that would be fine and and
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
you have your finger in the rules
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee right I know some people on
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
there yes so they get a brilliant Vice
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
chair perhaps you could if this strategy
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh is supported by this committee
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could car it would be
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
supported by the Vice chair as well
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
representative uh you had some comments
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
as well yeah so I just want to make sure
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's clear you're okay with us repealing
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
it and giving it to the historical today
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay yes John representative thank you
 
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
the reason I brought that up about this
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
store committee is that's in law and
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get rid of it no and
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
we you know all of us are going to be
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
gone at some point what one way or
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
another one way or another and um either
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
out of here or gone one way or the other
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
and so I was thinking Perpetual care
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that that'd be perfect that make me
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
sleep even better at
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
night we're going to put put a statue up
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%

know God bless you you're doing God's
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%

if you want I'm gonna quit while I'm
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
ahead I think Matt had a question for
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
you well I guess I'm just I'm curious
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
how we want to move forward with this it
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
sound it sounded like there was some
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
interest in uh moving it to the to
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
oversight of the memorial to the Joint
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
historic commission yeah I I what my my
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation before we took the vote
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
was that we look at doing that but not
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
right now that that we do that in after
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
we get all this other stuff put away
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
right that we do that with another
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle maybe through the rules
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee that because we're we're out
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
of time in terms of ol get this
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
so uh maybe you know maybe after the
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
first of the year we can look at it with
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
the with the embracement of the rules
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
committee we could put put it on a
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
special legislation that uh Mr chairman
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes I was under the understanding that
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
he said he's okay with it being repealed
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
putting a repeal on this amendment right
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
he did say that but I I I think he's
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
being he's being polite I think he what
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
he really wants is for us not to take
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
the action on this but uh but I think by
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
by putting it off we're not killing it
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
we're just saying we're going to do it
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
at a later date that's
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
all yeah when when we put it in the
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
commission then this can be repealed
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
it's you know say on the same
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
bill okay we all understand what we just
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
did that's later okay not today I think
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
I understand can
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
I can I see if I understand yeah I was
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
thinking we could do all of that in
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sheen's question and Bill
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like that's not really
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
possible so we're just doing so we're
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
not going to do it we're going to do all
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
of it later we're going to do this
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
particular this is this we're doing
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
today right okay because it has to go
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
this particular statute we're gonna
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to touch right now we're
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
going to bring it up later in the
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
calendar I think I think I got it thank
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah right that's technically what we're
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
doing right and I think that when we
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
started this committee we we we we had
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
the understanding that if any of these
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
activities are particularly contentious
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we're going to back off from that
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
because there is so much fertile ground
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
out there that we don't need to have
 
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.590 align:start position:0%
out there that we don't need to have
these

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
fights well thank you all there are two
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
great committees in the house this is
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
okay um next on our list yes
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
ma'am um I have a question regarding the
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
list before we go to the next one um so
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm under the impression this is the
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
list of ones we're going to um review
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily like a removal list this
 
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
is the removal list yeah but we're going
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
to also review them to make make sure
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
that that we're okay with that they're
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
on the removal list okay great okay
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah cuz cuz last time we met
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
everybody got
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
assigned and uh well well the one the
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
one we just talked about was on the
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
removal list also and we just took it
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
off so we can take others off as well
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
but right now there's still eight or
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
nine still on the list hopefully we'll
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
get most of
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
them okay uh representative
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
Simpson uh
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
4-c colon 37
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
archived so I don't really have a lot of
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
new information on this I reached out to
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
the senator on the um on the commission
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
because do we didn't talk about this
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
last time but this has been the
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
commission on demographic Trends was
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
recreated in 2022 and then the house
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
tried to repeal it just a few months ago
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
and the Senate rejected our attempt to
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
repeal so I guess I'm concerned that if
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
we put this on the removal list we are
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
um it might mess with the other things
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
that we're asking to repeal that are
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
much clearer and that maybe we should
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
put this off for its own I I I think the
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
the the mechanics of this would be as
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
long as the legi admin committee agrees
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
to put it on the list then it would
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
probably hand head down the road to a
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
consent calendar but you're right oh
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean when it gets to the Senate
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
gets to the Senate May more we're GNA
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
probably have to do a little bit of work
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
with our with our Senate brothers and
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
sisters to see if they can sustain the
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
activity to repeal it because because if
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
they kill it then it's not going to go
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere so
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
right well that's what I'm what I'm
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
trying to say is if they if they just
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
told us a few months ago that they don't
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
want to repeal the commission on
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends I'm suspicious that
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
the same Senate would change their mind
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
on that this month hopefully we we can
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
get the the uh chair and the ranking
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
member of the Edna committee which I
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
think this
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
originally uh was reviewed last spring
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
because of the UNH activity UNH provides
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
the demographics that everybody's happy
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
with and don't it doesn't anything or
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
any committee meetings or whatever that
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
if that is presented in
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
that that picture to the to some of the
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
key Senators then you know hopefully we
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
can sweep that up with with it we get uh
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
chair chairperson Maguire and U ranking
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
member of Edna to to do that for us so
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
that that would be the follow-up
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
activity and then if um if they decided
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
they still wanted it they could just
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
strip that one out they could if they if
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
they weren't you know what I mean if
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
they weren't
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
on on board they can take it they can
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
they can I guess remove it from
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
consent on their side if it's if it
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
makes in a consent on their side they
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
can remove it yeah I think they would I
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
think they would amend it right and
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
strip it out but I I do think knowing
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
that you know it was it it was itl in
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate I don't know why they would
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
change their tune now you know I'd be
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
curious to know how that debate
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
unfolded uh in the Senate because I
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
imagine that whomever worked on it in
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
Edna from the house went over to the
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
Senate and presented their reasoning so
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
yeah you were there for the Edna
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
discussion on this yeah and I just yeah
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
I I would be I would hesitate to
 
00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:56.519 align:start position:0%
include that Commission in this list
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
knowing that it already uh was a
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
challenge in the Senate previously this
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
term given that we have maybe eight or
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
nine I mean I guess we'll see where we
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
are at the end of today what people have
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
heard back but this seems like one we
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
could put aside for right now and see
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
this one the back burner yeah at least
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
for to and then come back to it even
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
today if we need to make a not maybe
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
we'll re Circle back to this one back
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
burner back
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
y all right what's next there Mr Vice
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
chairman okay uh next one is uh 21- I
 
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
chairman okay uh next one is uh 21- I
colon

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
colon
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
okay so if we could get it to a
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee of conference then we can we
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
argument I don't think it's worth it we
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
want this to go
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
smoothly it'd be nice if we could give
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
them something that they would
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
concur with or not
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
really since we haven't done a ton of
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
I just don't think we should be looking
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
for trouble if they just rejected a bill
 
00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:35.799 align:start position:0%
that tried to repeal this why would we
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
put this in again I just don't think
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
it's worth the
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
effort retain put it on the back burner
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
retain it yeah or let it continue to
 
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.470 align:start position:0%
retain it yeah or let it continue to
live

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
duplicative and that one is going
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
byby actually can I is that the
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
long-term SEO Commission on drinking
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
water yeah it is I so I live in the sea
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
coast and I represent towns that are
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
also represented by rep by Senator
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
Perkins quoka and I know that she's very
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
active in that commission and I just
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
wondered if um what her position on it
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
was like how it's working and all of
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
that and I got a very different
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
perspective than the one listed here in
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
the notes with the caveat that she said
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
there are Representatives on it that
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't participate so I um so I don't
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to be so quick to um
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
chop it if there's
 
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
um I mean I can read to you some of what
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
she sent me that they're working on but
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
they are actively doing work the Senate
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
is no this commission oh I see is is
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
actively doing doing work non
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
duplicative work yeah yeah okay it is so
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
let's put this in on the background okay
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
I have a feeling at the very least it
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
would be contentious in the
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Yeah the more information we get
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
about these the better that's what I was
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
thinking and that's why I knew I had
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
talked to her about it in the past so I
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure I had a
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with her before we came
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
together today okay um so we got one
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
two three that were taken off and
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
finally uh
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
651e interbranch criminal justice
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
representative Sheen yes I spoke with
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative Roy and they are actively
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
um using this this commission okay so
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
no that leaves us with six okay that
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
leaves us with
 
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.589 align:start position:0%
leaves us with
one

00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
got it thank
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
you we're down to six y six on the
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
backs interim study so the again the
 
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.710 align:start position:0%
backs interim study so the again the
thought

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
process uh with uh
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
the memorial that speaker sherff came
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
and spoke to us about is that uh he
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
seems like he's okay if it went to the
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
um historic
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
commission and uh I I think we probably
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
be okay with doing that also
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
but what we just made a commitment to do
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
is take it off our list maybe added on
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
after the first of the year through the
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
path of of um
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
the rules committee as opposed to legi
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
admin and and let give him time to to
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
review it with the activity with uh his
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
the fellow members on the
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
commission that and hopefully he'd be
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
supportive once he's done that come back
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
back to us and we can clear that up in
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
that path who knows with that Rules
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
Committee Action uh I'm not an expert on
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
how that would work but maybe we'll we
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
will have had an opportunity to add
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
another half dozen or so to our list
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we can put it all through that
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
with that vehicle through the rules
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee so um yeah I was I was
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
speaking with him and also with the
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
speaker is that that's a an opportunity
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
for us to get legislation input u in a
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
non you an out of cycle opportunity I
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
guess is through the rules committee we
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're us the legi admin Amendment route
 
00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:29.870 align:start position:0%
we're us the legi admin Amendment route
right

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
now but this would be a different
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
route just as effective a different
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
route I I think it might get more
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
visibility than than what we're doing
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
with this one but that's
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
okay we have good potential speakers if
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
we have to speak to
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
it okay so we got six going through
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
legie admin we we've got two hours to uh
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
to get that written up a documented you
 
00:40:58.319 --> 00:40:59.190 align:start position:0%
to get that written up a documented you
all

00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
set Vanessa to be able to do that you
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
want some you want to no I just saying
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
you want some help any more help with
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
that you need some authorship from any
 
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.589 align:start position:0%
that you need some authorship from any
of

00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
us you think you got it representative
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
wall you got any inputs on it you're on
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
that same committee it's pretty cut and
 
00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.670 align:start position:0%
that same committee it's pretty cut and
dried

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
dried
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay anybody else have any uh
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
any inputs be be before
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
our uh our working Representatives go
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
off and and Cs on this representative do
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
you have you've been through this before
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
do you have any any thoughts um no it's
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
a pretty straightforward process the
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
only thing is that OSS has to go through
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
and see if there are any uh cross
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
references to the ones that we're
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
repealing in any other
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
statutes so because it can be trickling
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
through but as a general matter it's
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
really straightforward you just list the
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
statute and and you're um and you're on
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
your way so oh right I'm going to look
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.109 align:start position:0%
 
meetings

00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
meeting we got to bring in the
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
chairs and I think so Grill them on the
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
Committees that they're responsible for
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
them yeah
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
I this is this is the last meeting for
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
this but we're going to continue because
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
Charter says it it was my understanding
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
that the speaker was ending the
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee but no oh no no we're we're on
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
for another year
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
on turn on that
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
mic for the
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
record I'm uh Gregory Hill um
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
representing Northfield um but this case
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm representing legislative
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
Administration um it's important for um
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative Shen to get to OS so that
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
we have a number that number will let us
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh schedule the next meeting um so so
 
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's critical that she get going um but
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
number two um I would like it if someone
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
from this committee would plan on
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
attending the legislative Administration
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
meeting on the 10th uh I'm sorry the eth
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's a public hearing public hearing
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
for this bill because as you I'm sure
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
realize um aside from the two members
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
that uh share both committees um some of
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
Cu inti some of the information
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
um comes from other people than those
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
two so if there is questions that arise
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
that people come to argue why they're
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
commission is on is on the list um it
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
would be good if the people that had
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
that conversation um we're there to
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
answer for that well I can tell you that
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
the chair and the vice chair will be
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
there and that's up to Matt whether you
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
want a ranking member or a
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative from your side to come as
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
well well the ranking member is here um
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
no I'm talking about rank member of this
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
committee okay well um I I'm not
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
designating who or or pointing fingers
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
but um but it would be helpful I'm sure
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
will be there yeah we're going to be
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
there just don't have much of time offer
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
to Matt if he wants one of the Democrat
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
members to be yeah I just want to
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
impress upon the committee that we don't
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
there isn't the timeline in here in
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
order to we need to handle everything on
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
that day pretty much um so so if we can
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
get the answers to anyone that has
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about the commissions that are
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
that are being asked um it would be good
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we could answer them during that that
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
hearing what time what time is the
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
meeting on the year
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't scheduled it yet but uh
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
but I would suspect it's probably 10
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
um and we'll do our best to put this on
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
First and uh you want to think about it
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of attend well I think what's
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
important is that the member of this
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
committee who have the conversations
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
with members of other commissions that
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
they be an attendance because otherwise
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
I mean there will be members there right
 
00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
there will be and and you Mr chairman
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
were here for this conversation so
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to some extent as well
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
however to say yes I had this
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
conversation they indeed said that they
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
no longer need to be a commission that's
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
what we're look that's what you're
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
looking for that's right in preparation
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
for the work in addition to that uh or
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that um it would be good
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
if if perhaps there was some
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
consideration about whether this
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to be divisible um
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
when it gets to the house floor and and
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
how those questions are going to be
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
answered on the floor this is a little
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
bit different you know we're getting um
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
the work of one committee passed on to
 
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.270 align:start position:0%
the work of one committee passed on to
another

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee that it's not really fair for
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
that committee to be the one that right
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
we we hoping for the work that you
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
insert this in consent calendar you see
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
that that happening or not happening you
 
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.549 align:start position:0%
that that happening or not happening you
know

00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
um we've had we've had n none of this uh
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
in front of us now I it would be a it
 
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
would be a great big guess on my part um
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's been a very Cooperative
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee but um this is this is not
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
within our baileywick so um I'm not this
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
year we haven't seen any of these
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
committees listed so we don't know would
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
it would do you think it would be
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to have a member of leadership
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh either speak speaker or the former
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
speaker come as an from an introduction
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
to say what this is all about this
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee uncommit no I don't I don't I
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't um the committee is familiar with
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
it at least several of the members uh
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
we've gone through through this process
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
um honorable uh well representative eel
 
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
is uh walked us through and and gave us
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
our our um well my learning curve on the
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
um youve probably been through this
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
several times representative wal but it
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
is um we've done this
 
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.510 align:start position:0%
is um we've done this
before

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's never
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
predictable who wants to come and com
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
contradict what we think is logical um
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
but somewhere along the line I will
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
wager that someone on the floor will
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
suggest that one of these needs to stay
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
where it is and and um and why they
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
didn't show up at this committee I don't
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
know why they won't show up at at the
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
legi admin public hearing I don't know
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
but someone on the floor will ask
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
something to be removed they'll try to
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
pull it off consent and then the
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
question is who's going to be the one
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
that says this is why it needs to be
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
there so that's all well you'll have
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
representation there that's all just not
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
sure what the mix of it then my work
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
done anything else I can do for you
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
no I have a question are you
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
anticipating changes to sb84 aside from
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
what we're doing no it's going to be
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
replace all as far as I'm
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
concerned if that's what you mean by CH
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
well I I should have asked the question
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
first no I I just I'm trying to remember
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
what the bill was as it came from the
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
Senate and I wondered if you were change
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
S sp84 has a yeah has a long and storied
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
history um it originally started dealing
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
with Plymouth New Hampshire and uh and
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
something completely different um it was
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
it was stripped and then turned into
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
what you see as 84
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
now I plan on stripping 84 and putting
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
this in um and one other
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
thing what's going to go to a committee
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
of conference
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
probably right or maybe maybe not we'll
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
have to see how it goes there may be
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
other things the rules was that a
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer huh no I don't I'm not
 
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.030 align:start position:0%
volunteer huh no I don't I'm not
volunteering

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
volunteering
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
anything it sounds like our bill will be
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
different it sounded like the I don't
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
know so we'll
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
see thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%

good all right so the 13th and the 27th
at

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
1:30 and uh and Matt you'll let me know
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
if you want uh to have representation on
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
the on the eth in addition to I mean I I
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
maintain that
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know between representative wall and
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sheen like there's
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's rep representation there I I do
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
think that anybody who has been looking
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
into any of these commissions and has
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
recommended that they be you know
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
recommended to our full group that they
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
be repealed um it would be helpful to
 
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
have them there in case any questions
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
come up so I don't know that any one
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
person any one additional person is
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful I think it's if we
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
had conversations that you know helped
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
to indicate that that they should be I
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
want to be as inclusive as possible so I
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to exclude anybody so I guess
 
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
if if you want to come but aren't
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
specifically asked to come to speak to
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
any you want to come just to be
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
supportive and backup U you do that yes
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
I was just going to well I guess either
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman or representative will I
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
I have a conflict that morning so to the
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
extent my um exchange with the
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
appointments on that committee we over
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
email is it okay to just like forward
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah just correspondence Nar that record
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
or that documentation yeah just give us
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
some narrative I haven't had any phone
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
conversations actually at this point EI
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
anyway so I'll F what I have for email I
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
think that's perfect yes ma'am yeah um
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say is that if we
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
just got a signal from a chair that that
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
says it's okay to get rid of it without
 
00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
says it's okay to get rid of it without
the

00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
rationale I think we better find out
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
what the what the rationale was I mean
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
on the county state commission I mean
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
represent maybe you talked to
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
representative Wier I'm not sure yeah I
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
did and yeah and because because they
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to meet and if they want to
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
meet they can meet anyway without I
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
think what she's suggesting is let get
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
some context yeah we just theend I think
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
we if some if we have a question I mean
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the case of that particular
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
commission that was one that was really
 
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
focused on by the commission that I
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
chaired so I also uh followed up on it
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
although nobody asked me to and the the
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
thing is that and this is just I want to
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
share this with the commission because
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
it's also an interesting fact apparently
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
these guys have been meeting robustly
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
the the County State finance committee
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
they've been meeting robustly over the
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
last several months or even a couple of
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
years but
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
because the the group is not uh
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
submitting notices of their meetings to
 
00:55:11.319 --> 00:55:12.270 align:start position:0%
submitting notices of their meetings to
our

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
calendar it was basically not
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
trackable by our staff and so it shows
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
here that they haven't met in TW since
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
2012 when actually they have been that's
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
Anis jald was telling us they don't
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
notify us what they've done so that's
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
one of those things where you almost
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
have to call the agency or something but
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
what they said to me was that they're
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
very com the agency said they were very
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable meeting on an ad Haw basis
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
which I think is what what chair wer
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
said um that they were meet comfortable
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
meeting on the on a ad hoc basis so
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
although they
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
were uh not excited about repealing it
 
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
when we looked into it at this point
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
they think the Adcock basis is uh okay
 
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
but it's just was interesting to me to
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
hear that they'd been meeting a lot and
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
nobody knew because it's not in our
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
calendar it's just another issue with
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
commissions but I anyway the point is
 
00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.039 align:start position:0%
that I think we have to give the be able
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
to give people a rationale rather than
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
just say the chair said we don't need to
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
anymore good input
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay with that being said I think we can
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
adjourn okay we're adjourn cool see you
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
