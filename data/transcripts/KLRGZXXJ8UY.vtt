welcome
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
we have listed
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
several bills on the executive session
 
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
for today but one in particular I wanted
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
to highlight House Bill 639 we will not
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
be executing today so if you're here for
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we have scheduled a full committee
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
work session next Tuesday at 10 A.M
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard that there will not be a
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
house session next Tuesday so we will do
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
a full committee work session and we've
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
requested the agencies that were in
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
attendance at the public hearing to come
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
back and help us as we do a deep dive on
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
that bill so we're not going to exec 639
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
our deadline for that bill is March 30th
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
so we are tentatively planning to exec
 
00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
it on Monday March 27th to give us a
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
little wiggle room if we need it
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay so moving along in the calendar the
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
for some reason I don't get it gavel
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
we will now open up the executive
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
session on house spill 494 relative to
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
the fees collected under the New
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fertilizer law and the chair
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
will recognize representative almi for a
 
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.790 align:start position:0%
will recognize representative almi for a
motion

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to move
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
on retain on this bill and I'd like to
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
explain uh the pieces of it that I
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
finally figured out two nights ago when
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
I bothered to look it up in dedicated
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
funds well we rely heavily on that but
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
could I have a second on the retained
 
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.170 align:start position:0%
could I have a second on the retained
motion

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:50.180 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative elberger seconds the
 
00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
motion okay please yes inform us
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay and there is before you now
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
a page called fund name product scale
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
testing and Horticultural registration
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
under detailed activities it explains
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has specific laws
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
governing commercial feeds in commercial
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
feeds including Pet Foods commercial
 
00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:21.009 align:start position:0%
feeds including Pet Foods commercial
fertilizers

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:21.019 align:start position:0%
fertilizers
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
agricultural liming materials and
 
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
Horticultural growing media
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
that is what it says
 
00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:31.339 align:start position:0%
on and it talks about registration
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
labeling and testing
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
it says that the department samples and
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
test products each year to com ensure
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
compliance with label guarantees and
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
respond to complaints from consumers
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
there is a long-term need for the fund
 
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
balance to support a department
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
initiative to increase the number of
 
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.290 align:start position:0%
initiative to increase the number of
products

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
sampled and tested the fees that go into
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
this are only on commercial feeds they
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
are not on fertilizers which as I have
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
never heard of it being referred to as a
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
fee but as a feed before but
 
00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:07.430 align:start position:0%
fee but as a feed before but
um

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
neither is Horticultural growing media
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
so on if you look up at the chart in the
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
top middle
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
on this account for at least four years
 
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
and as I recall when they came before us
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
I believe it was four five years ago and
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we'll be seeing them again this
 
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.009 align:start position:0%
that we'll be seeing them again this
year

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:30.019 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
before dedicated funds they uh
 
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
have a ending balance which is at least
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
twice their expenses
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
in this fund
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
so we have that problem why is the
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner not allowing them to do
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
fertilizer testing if fertilizer testing
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be done in here
 
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
but the other side of it is fertilizer
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
testing is supposed to be done in here
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
but at feeds is paying for all of it
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
and if they're doing fertilizers
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
at least half of what they're doing is
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:18.889 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:20.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
there's that question and also there is
 
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:26.660 align:start position:0%
a question that overlaps with the olpc
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
oplc bill
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
which is what is a legitimate legal
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
amount of surplus that should be
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
retained in a dedicated fund
 
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:43.820 align:start position:0%
we have dedicated funds that are doing
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
two three times
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
their expenses or more because they're
 
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
saving up to pay for a building because
 
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
the old one is falling into Lake
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee we've had funds that were
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
saving up a number of them saving up for
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
databases on and other ways to reduce
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
their their staff expenses or to be able
 
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
to do as in this case everything that
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing according
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
to our laws
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
um but then there are others where the
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
balance just keeps growing
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
and that's what the dedicated fund
 
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
committee looks into every five years
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
but if we look into it as the dedicated
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
fund committee we will just be coming
 
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
back to Ways and Means and environment
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
and agriculture to to ask them to do
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
what we could do in a
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
study committee this summer
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
or fall
 
00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:50.990 align:start position:0%
or fall
and

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
I I think that if
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's allowed but if we
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
expanded that that question to be what
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
is a proper
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
balance to keep in the fund
 
00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
on that we might be able to solve part
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
of our oplc problem at the same time
 
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.150 align:start position:0%
of our oplc problem at the same time
yeah

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
I can certainly ask the speaker if he
 
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
would consider that Jermaine to a
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
retained Bill discussion
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
and if not certainly someone could
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor a bill yeah and we could do it
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
that way yes except that on study
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee is the second year don't work
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
um basically we could study this in
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
terms of this particular bill but we
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell the old plc uh hint that
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
she had to come and talk to us in the
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
Comptroller together
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh well we could also we're going to
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
discuss this later of course but we had
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
another dedicated fund when Bill your
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
bill that we've already passed through
 
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
the house we'll see when it comes back
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
from the Senate that may be a vehicle we
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
could utilize
 
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.150 align:start position:0%
could utilize
on

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
on you mean if if I got that that added
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't add it after it had
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
been to the Senate yeah something to
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
think about your weight there's
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
different ways to keep working on that
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
topic representative ulery did you have
 
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
something to say
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
no but the comments that the majority
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
and minority well Susan ah made
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
whatever uh are very appropriate having
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
and dealt just a little bit with oplc
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
and and some of the other uh dedicated
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
funds across the years uh referencing
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and the marina
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
building which was literally falling
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
into Lake Winnipesaukee uh some form of
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed there
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's anything
 
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.669 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's anything
preventing

00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
00:17:58.679 --> 00:17:59.390 align:start position:0%
preventing
um

00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.770 align:start position:0%
um
any

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
particular chair or member from calling
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
a ad hoc Maybe
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
regarding this so
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
that may be another uh method but it's
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
definitely something we should address
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to co-sponsor any such
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
well not any such such legislation
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
yes we could certainly uh do a public
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
notice on a not if it's a non-germaine
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment and just on a particular bill
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
we can always as long as it's noticed in
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.310 align:start position:0%
the calendar we can certainly do that
yeah

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have any bills left except the
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
ones coming from the sentence true but
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
when we retain this bill we could do it
 
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.330 align:start position:0%
when we retain this bill we could do it
then

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
representative Oliver would you like to
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you the primary uh Bill we
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
discussed uh in detail previously
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
requiring regarding the need for such a
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
fund uh within oplc all this amendment
 
00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
does is reduce the uh excess funds uh
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
are capped at uh three million dollars
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
as opposed to five million dollars
 
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.450 align:start position:0%
as opposed to five million dollars
um

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:55.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
this uh particular dedicated fund is
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to uh if you will tide over
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
oplc are regarding their various
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
operational uh deficiencies that take
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
place because of the current requirement
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
to lapse everything into a fund and it
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
follows along with the previous
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
discussion we had regarding the entire
 
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:22.700 align:start position:0%
uh dedicated fund structure thank you
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
we just had a I just had a discussion
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
with Chris Shea to know how the oplc
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
survives now
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
because it is getting on virtually very
 
00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:45.620 align:start position:0%
little money until six months after
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
they've had everything lapsed on and he
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
explained that with dedicated funds like
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
this they do the laps and then the
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
treasurer runs a negative balance
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
which is essentially on the general fund
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
but it has to be paid back by the end of
 
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
um and on so
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
the the fund is officially paid for by
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
other sources which is the registration
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
and other fees that they get penalties
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
on but it comes out of the general fund
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
which just got the lapse it comes back
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
out of it to pay for their operations
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
until a they are
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative fellows
 
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.190 align:start position:0%
yes representative fellows
so

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
having some experience from working
 
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
within a state agency
 
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.630 align:start position:0%
within a state agency
um

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's there there is
 
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's not a cash flow issue
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
with this this fund that they currently
 
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.409 align:start position:0%
with this this fund that they currently
have

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not like a business
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's more like a school district or a
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
municipality where you appropriate money
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
and that gives the different agencies
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
the authority to spend that money
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
the revenue is is accounted for
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
separately and the fact that your agency
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
hasn't brought in
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know enough money from day one to
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
cover expenditures is not a problem
 
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
because when we vote on the budget we
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
establish the Authority for that agency
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
agency to spend the money they need to
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
operate to pay their employees and
 
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.070 align:start position:0%
operate to pay their employees and
whatever

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.990 align:start position:0%
whatever
so

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:48.860 align:start position:0%
you know that's just the general context
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
I see no reason for even needing this
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
at all to to change their fund at all
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
make sufficient money so far they've
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
always been lapsing money at the end of
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
the year back to the general fund
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think that the amendment I'm not see
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I'm looking at the
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
amendment or the bill
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
part of it yeah that's fine so which
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
part of it has
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
giving them the authority to um
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
make Capital expenditures without going
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
through the oversight of the appropriate
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
Committee in the house to do that you
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
know we have a capital budget it's
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
therefore a reason
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we really need to
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
to make those expenditures it's I don't
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
think it's up to
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
oplc to decide if they want to if they
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
want to buy a building to have their
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
offices in I think that's part of the
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility of other com of
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
committees in in the legislature
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
and they can they can get what they need
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
by making a case for it asking the
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
governor to put it in his budget asking
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
um the you know
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate committees for a Thor
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
telling them that they need
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
um new facilities if that's the case one
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that we know is that
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a proposal on the
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
table already to move Justice to the
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
building where Lincoln Financial used to
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
be we know that because we have already
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
approved a project to build the parking
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
garage on their site so we know that
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
building's going away and they need to
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
move somewhere else it may be more
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
appropriate if oplc needs office space
 
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the place for them to go
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
and that's a decision for administrative
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
services to make and not oplc so I see
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
no reason
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
for passing this
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
bill it all thank you thank you
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative and I should I did that a
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
little bit in a rush where technically
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
first voting on the amendment so the
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
amendment was moved so we'll be voting
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
on the amendment first which uh is
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
really putting a cap on the thing and
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
then we will vote on the ought to pass
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
with Amendment which includes the
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bill so I kind of joined
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
those together by mistake so I apologize
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
for that representative Ames
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
focusing on the amendment
 
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
focusing on the amendment
um

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
I I find myself unclear on what changes
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
this makes from current law
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
I was just looking at what I have online
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
as current law
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
and it has no limit in it
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing there's no in excess of
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
a certain dollar number
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
um is there is there a limit somewhere
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
else is it in the budget Bill maybe a
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
would you clarify this I believe in the
 
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
bill that came to us from the other
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee there was a cap on it or no no
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
you would have requested one and passed
 
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
it without uh requesting that Ways and
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
Means add a cap to it
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
which was the request to be DNA which
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
approved the policy of adding this to
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bill currently the uh what it says
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
in here is it's a non-lapsing fund so
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
the amendment changes it to I mean it's
 
00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:35.330 align:start position:0%
the amendment changes it to I mean it's
elapses

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
elapses
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
and this changes it to a non-lapsing
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
fund and caps the amount of money
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
retained at three million dollars uh
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
currently as uh representative almi
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier uh what happens is the
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
money comes in
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
he gets sent back to the general fund
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it gets drawn on the general fund so
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
then they run with a negative balance
 
00:28:59.930 --> 00:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
until such time as they get that paid
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
off and then they have we depend upon
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
the licensing that comes in and and how
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
many fees come in and how many uh uh
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
investigations need to take place how
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
many hearings need to take place how
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
many people apply for oh there's a lot
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
of variables that take place so what
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
this does is sets up a uh
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
I hate to use the term but it's a
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
fund of money that they can draw from
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
without drawing from or drawing on not
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
from but drawing on the general fund to
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
cover operations
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh as representative Almighty explained
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative self-worth sorry I'm
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
sorry representative did you have more
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
to say okay
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
so this basically is a clarifying
 
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.230 align:start position:0%
so this basically is a clarifying
Amendment

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
it really just clarifies the process it
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
does put a number in
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative all me it's reducing the
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
amount of money on that they can retain
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
permanently away from from the general
 
00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
permanently away from from the general
funding

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:09.409 align:start position:0%
funding
um

00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
I wanted to put a sunset on this
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
um that would take it back to uh
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
elapsing Fund in a couple of years
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
simply to be able to remember that we
 
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
need they are planning on all kinds of
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
changes which would make it less
 
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.649 align:start position:0%
changes which would make it less
expensive

00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
so that we could take that cap down
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
further if it was so indicated because
 
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
but on
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
we tried to put it through Drafting and
 
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
drafting was not being responsive
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
so this is what we've got
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
just have to remember that uh we may
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
want to look at it again
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
as a committee uh representative already
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up again or was
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
that Southwest yes I just wanted to
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
remind the community that we do have a
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
bill coming over in about a month
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
from the other body that's very similar
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
to this with some other language that's
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
coming through the idea being that uh
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
this makes an excellent uh platform for
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
working with the other body uh when we
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
sit down and mesh things together a
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
little bit later
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative self-worth yeah no I was
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
fine sorry
 
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
representative Platt I just want to say
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
we could pass this bill and if there's a
 
00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:38.419 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
having a drop dead date it let to make
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
it lapse that can be done next year
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee okay
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the role
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
on the amendment so the motion is ought

representative fellows so thank you

madam chair well in addition to what I
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
said earlier
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I would just now that we know there's
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
a similar Bill coming from the Senate I
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
think that that would give us an
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to maybe hear more
 
00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:23.899 align:start position:0%
um technical
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
explanations of why you want a
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund
 
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:33.260 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
because my objection is I see no
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason for doing this and
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
also whether or not it's appropriate to
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
put things in there like that it will be
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
used for Capital expenditures which more
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
normally go through administrative
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
services so I would like to you know I'm
 
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.129 align:start position:0%
services so I would like to you know I'm
a

00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
opposed because I would rather see the
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
spill it out and then that would give us
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
more time to take the Senate bill when
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%

consent
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%

regular calendar
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
not not on the regular calendar but it
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
has an FN does that can we put an FN on
 
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.569 align:start position:0%
has an FN does that can we put an FN on
consent

00:36:34.569 --> 00:36:34.579 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
depends on the dollar amount I think so
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know for sure
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
um do you know if it's I'm I'm not going
 
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.250 align:start position:0%
um do you know if it's I'm I'm not going
to

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
um oppose it if it and and I don't I'm
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
not going to oppose it because either it
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
can't go on the consent calendar or if
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
it does I'm not planning to speak
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
against it okay would you like to be
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
no well I it would be great if we could
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
get it by the end of today
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
um but that we don't have to because
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
this bill actually is a second committee
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
bill so we we actually do have a little
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
bit of time
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
I will try okay I mean I can't get it
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
done today for sure but maybe by
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay well a Minority Report
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
means actually tomorrow's not going to
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
be much of an option I don't think okay
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
well so yeah and so it The Minority
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
Report I representative almeid just
 
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
pointed out if you do a report then it
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
really can't go on consent because
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
consent is everyone consents that is
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
okay to go on consent calendar
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
so skip it okay no Minority Report it
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
will then go on consent calendar
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
certainly anyone has the option to let
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
the members of the house as a whole know
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
their thoughts through an email or
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
whatever so okay all right so we will
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
now close the public hearing uh so ought
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended does pass and we'll
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
go on the consent calendar and we'll now
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
defects sheet and by and large that's
 
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
what this should represent so I'm
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative Doucette is going to
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
go back to OLS and bring those to their
 
00:52:10.849 --> 00:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
attention it doesn't look like a lot
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
when we compare notes
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully we'll catch it and be
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
right back but we will now have to
 
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.010 align:start position:0%
right back but we will now have to
recess

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
recess
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit later so if you want
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
to go get a lunch yes representative
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
Phillips so we were trying to check them
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
against this this document and so we
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
found that the first one wasn't
 
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.329 align:start position:0%
found that the first one wasn't
fixed

00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
I think it was
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was looking for two voters
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
directly uh
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
they State the amendment is accurate it
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
correctly addresses all the technical
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
issues identified by the lottery uh
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
what's he reading the the lottery
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
worksheet was incorrect regarding the
 
00:52:57.609 --> 00:52:57.619 align:start position:0%
expiration date of facility licenses and
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
the goe license lottery agrees the
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is the correct warding
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
what are you reading where's that from
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's a text message from someone at
 
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
Lottery uh
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
through another person yes okay so I'm
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
looking at the handout that we got
 
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
from the lottery and the updated it's it
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
stated that the lottery sent this to LBA
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
on 12 30.
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
let you know at the end of the year and
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
it's in the first thing on here it says
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
is on of the original bill
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
page two line 18 that the license
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be asking them to submit
 
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.010 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be asking them to submit
something

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
um annually submit some kind of
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
statement on December 31st it said it
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
ought to be aligned with when the
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
license and that's not changed in the
 
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.690 align:start position:0%
license and that's not changed in the
amendment

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
what's the page in line in the original
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
well on the original bill it's page 2
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
so it's so it's Roman numeral three and
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
on the amendment that starts on line 11
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
and it still says December 31st
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
great catch well I'll address that all
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
I think I have thank you original only
 
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes on I've got a question with page two
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
original on
 
00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:46.970 align:start position:0%
original on
d8

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
d8
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
um Section 5 and the amendment uh it's
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
about the game operator employer license
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
application the person that owns the
 
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.589 align:start position:0%
application the person that owns the
thing

00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
and it on in the original it
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
it which has been excluded now it says
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to the general requirements
 
00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:14.540 align:start position:0%
under 287 D5 a game operator employment
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
license application shall include at a
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
minimum the following information
 
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
provided that the Lottery Commission May
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
by rule establish additional items to be
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
submitted on the application form or
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
attached to it and they were telling us
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
that if they had some suspicions about
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
the entity that was controlling that on
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
they would go from the
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
principal owner even down to people that
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
owned one percent of the operation on
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
and look at them and it seems to me like
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
this is being taken out at this point
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
and there's also it says if the
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
applicant is an individual then there's
 
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to be a photo taken
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there is
 
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.390 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there is
on

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
being a lot less
 
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.829 align:start position:0%
being a lot less
uh

00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.329 align:start position:0%
uh
on

00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
license for the people on the groups
 
00:56:22.859 --> 00:56:24.109 align:start position:0%
license for the people on the groups
that

00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
come in as
 
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.730 align:start position:0%
come in as
as

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:27.740 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
corporations or as LLCs that they would
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
avoid a lot of scrutiny that they would
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
I don't know a lot about this area but I
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
would wonder why that section was taken
 
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.690 align:start position:0%
would wonder why that section was taken
out

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
good well I can just mention that
 
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Rocher brought up in the
 
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:53.809 align:start position:0%
representative Rocher brought up in the
um

00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:55.940 align:start position:0%
in the hearing and the work session
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
concern about too much broad making rule
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
Authority and lots of bills in fact he's
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
looking at other bills in the same
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
regard so we as we talked about maybe
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
not having such carte blanche
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
rule-making Authority everywhere if if
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to put back under 541a or
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
something like that but it just was kind
 
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:19.700 align:start position:0%
of vague there and a bunch of places so
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's why that's there but I don't know
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
about the photograph you're talking
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
about the photograph Piece One Piece of
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
It is the photograph but then above it
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
there is the ability of the Lottery
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
Commission to by rule establish
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
additional items to be submitted on the
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
application form
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
that is just kind of it could be a
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
humongous list so if you'd like to have
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
that go through rule making so to figure
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
out what that list should be but what
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
well I
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
it does say by rule
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
which I presume means it has to go
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
through a jail car
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
there are other places that it does say
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
under 541 but in some places it doesn't
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that means that
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at page four on the
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
original bill it definitely references
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
541a but it doesn't in in several other
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
places which I think is kind of an
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
oversight probably because everything
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
does go through 541a so yeah
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
if yeah that all all the uh game
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
operators uh goe licenses are to a uh a
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
business entity so it's not going to be
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
affected by
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh what representative Olney speaking of
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
it they're not going through it the
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
license is applied with by a business
 
00:58:42.059 --> 00:58:44.630 align:start position:0%
license is applied with by a business
entity

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.819 --> 00:58:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
not yeah I have a
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
memories on Ames
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
a comment or a question
 
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.650 align:start position:0%
a comment or a question
um

00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
there are I think three places where
 
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:03.740 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
add-on that the Lottery Commission made
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
by rule established additional items to
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
be submitted to be submitted
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
um has been taken out
 
00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.589 align:start position:0%
um has been taken out
and

00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to and I I know this means
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill rather than going
 
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
forward on it I'd like to hear from the
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission what we're giving up
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to understand why you know
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
there may be this broader
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
argument that we're delegating too much
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
to the Lottery Commission I can
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
understand that argument but
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
um in this
 
00:59:45.299 --> 00:59:47.089 align:start position:0%
um in this
instance

00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is a long-standing program is there
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
some problem with what the commission
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
has been doing have we given too much
 
00:59:58.030 --> 00:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
license to the commission
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
through through this kind of language is
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
that why it's being taken out I'd like
 
01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
I'd like to explore it and we're not
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that in the
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
couple of hours we've got uh here and at
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'd like to say they did tell
 
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
us some of what's being taken out when I
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
think I I asked how whether they
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
were exploring beyond the primary
 
01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.809 align:start position:0%
were exploring beyond the primary
employer

01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
and now we're being told that it's an
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
entity which does that
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
if there isn't anything in there about
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
the individuals in that entity
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
on we really don't know who who is
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a new one we don't
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
know who's controlling it
 
01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:54.740 align:start position:0%
and whether they have a record of
 
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay well so let's have uh
 
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette go back to OLS
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
with some fixes and we will we will come
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
back yes yes but I I want to be clear
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
these these changes to those specifics
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
that we've just spoken about in relation
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the specific rules with with the
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
bling demo item for item I think
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
my perspective in looking at this wasn't
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
to negate the ability of Lottery to do
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
anything it was clearly defined in some
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
of these sections and it seemed to list
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
out a running list and I know I
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
discussed it with the chair and maybe
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
you can give some clarity to that
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
because I have no problem keeping this
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
in this isn't a a deal breaker in this
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think where the bases
 
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
are covered with the plain language
 
01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
that's in that's in the bill itself and
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is that we're
 
01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
trying to correct the technical fixes
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
that were identified if they haven't
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
been done already so that's but we'll
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we do okay point of order
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative does it make sense
 
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
depending on how busy they are for us to
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
do our quick lunch and then come back
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
and do it it sounds like a great time
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
for a lunch so we will
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so what I'll do is I'll open the
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
exact session on 60 House Bill 607 and
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
then I will immediately recess it
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
um to one o'clock and hopefully by then
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
we have a clean Amendment thank you very
 
01:02:42.609 --> 01:02:42.619 align:start position:0%
much so we'll close House Bill 607 and
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative would it be possible
 
02:39:42.770 --> 02:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
to just get a sort of rundown on what
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
are the changes in this compared to the
 
02:39:45.849 --> 02:39:45.859 align:start position:0%
last version
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely the only thing is one of our
 
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
Representatives just left I just found
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
out she has another amendment so we're
 
02:39:55.969 --> 02:39:55.979 align:start position:0%
waiting for that oh I did not know that
 
02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
read through it and see and hopefully
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
um when the representative moves his
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment he will tell us what's going
 
02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:25.550 align:start position:0%
Amendment he will tell us what's going
on

02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.929 --> 02:40:29.939 align:start position:0%
okay this is different here
 
02:43:56.510 --> 02:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:58.610 --> 02:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
we will attempt to do this one more time
 
02:44:00.770 --> 02:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
we will open up the executive session on
 
02:44:01.929 --> 02:44:01.939 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:44:01.939 --> 02:44:03.490 align:start position:0%
House Bill
607

02:44:03.490 --> 02:44:03.500 align:start position:0%
607
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I should always remember to mention
 
02:44:08.510 --> 02:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
that I am a charitable gaming operator
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
as well as my husband so the chair will
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Doucet to
 
02:44:17.450 --> 02:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
introduce to make a motion
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I move
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.090 --> 02:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
I second that representative Bolton
 
02:44:33.170 --> 02:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
seconds uh representative set would you
 
02:44:34.849 --> 02:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
like to explain to us what this
 
02:44:38.210 --> 02:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
amendment does most certainly uh not to
 
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
rehash what we spoke about this morning
 
02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
but in a nutshell IT addresses the
 
02:44:46.969 --> 02:44:46.979 align:start position:0%
four-page uh
 
02:44:49.610 --> 02:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
bullet points that Lottery had given to
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
us prior to the hearing when we heard
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:54.830 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:58.370 --> 02:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
IT addresses some specifics in relation
 
02:44:58.380 --> 02:44:59.889 align:start position:0%
IT addresses some specifics in relation
to

02:44:59.889 --> 02:44:59.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
rule making and Lottery's rulemaking and
 
02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
and brings out uh
 
02:45:10.849 --> 02:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
and references specifically RSA 541a in
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
four different places that need to be
 
02:45:18.170 --> 02:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
02:45:23.929 --> 02:45:23.939 align:start position:0%
it added some language that spelled out
 
02:45:28.969 --> 02:45:28.979 align:start position:0%
uh specifics relative to different
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
sure and made some technical and
 
02:45:40.730 --> 02:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
spelling typographical type errors were
 
02:45:48.110 --> 02:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:51.410 --> 02:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
another discussion on Amendment forgive
 
02:45:54.590 --> 02:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
me also another one at the end the
 
02:45:56.809 --> 02:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
02:46:00.290 --> 02:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
it would it would State uh instead of in
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
I believe the original Amendment stated
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh December of 24 it specifies that
 
02:46:08.809 --> 02:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
sections nine and ten which are raising
 
02:46:08.819 --> 02:46:09.590 align:start position:0%
sections nine and ten which are raising
the

02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
Max bet from 10 to 25 dollars in the
 
02:46:15.889 --> 02:46:15.899 align:start position:0%
tournament bet to 2500 would take effect
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
upon passage of this and the remainder
 
02:46:22.130 --> 02:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
of the changes would take place uh post
 
02:46:25.130 --> 02:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
after take effect after 60 days of its
 
02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:29.750 align:start position:0%
after take effect after 60 days of its
Passage

02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
of Elber I really would appreciate a
 
02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
line by line here because I'm finding
 
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
some of the changes but I'm not willing
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
to vote on something if I don't have the
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a man what I
 
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
keep looking at is from what we got from
 
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
Lottery the last page which is the
 
02:46:52.490 --> 02:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
technical or mechanical defects and that
 
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
is what this is primarily trying to
 
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
address so I think that is what
 
02:46:58.910 --> 02:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
this does but if you want to go through
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh we can if that's what you would like
 
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh referring to
 
02:47:10.250 --> 02:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
Lotter Lottery's uh technical or
 
02:47:14.090 --> 02:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
mechanical defects and I'm told by
 
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
Lottery that they were all addressed if
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
you want me to go item for item I can do
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
that okay uh in the original Bill page
 
02:47:26.090 --> 02:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.530 --> 02:47:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
also page three line five
 
02:47:36.420 --> 02:47:41.570 align:start position:0%
also page three line five

02:47:41.570 --> 02:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
can you just give us the differences
 
02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
between the two amendments that we got
 
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
this morning between the two amendments
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
the one that we got this morning oh sure
 
02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
and this one sure that makes it so much
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.429 --> 02:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh you're welcome to leave anytime you
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
need to yeah okay so if if the member
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
would be care to answer the question of
 
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
comparing the two different amendments
 
02:48:25.910 --> 02:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about the two
 
02:48:27.650 --> 02:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
different amendments
 
02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:29.809 align:start position:0%
different amendments
um

02:48:29.809 --> 02:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
okay the date was correct like I like I
 
02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
laid out prior to the the effect dates
 
02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:43.030 align:start position:0%
laid out prior to the the effect dates
changed

02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:48:45.469 --> 02:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
the issue with that you had brought up
 
02:48:50.809 --> 02:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
representative was addressed
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh relative to spelling a particular
 
02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
and forgive me I gave OLS my notes copy
 
02:49:15.530 --> 02:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:18.410 --> 02:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and the four sections
 
02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:23.530 align:start position:0%
um and the four sections
where

02:49:23.530 --> 02:49:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I believe we had a written down this
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
four sections where it specifically
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
calls reference to RSA 541a
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
that did not specify that in the
 
02:49:36.479 --> 02:49:39.050 align:start position:0%
that did not specify that in the
original

02:49:39.050 --> 02:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

02:49:40.490 --> 02:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:49:44.090 --> 02:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
we look on page two
 
02:49:49.070 --> 02:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
I believe D9 which is line 19. reading
 
02:49:52.490 --> 02:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
down into that at line 24.
 
02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh in part it says in the in addition to
 
02:49:59.270 --> 02:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
the general requirements under uh 287
 
02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
and it continues on WE inserted
 
02:50:07.250 --> 02:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why it's not in italics
 
02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:10.730 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why it's not in italics
but

02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
rules adopted by the commission under
 
02:50:17.929 --> 02:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:20.450 --> 02:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
and establish additional items which was
 
02:50:23.870 --> 02:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
there so it's basically specifying RSA
 
02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:26.210 align:start position:0%
there so it's basically specifying RSA
541a

02:50:26.210 --> 02:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
541a
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:50:31.849 --> 02:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
spelled out in three other places and
 
02:50:33.530 --> 02:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
again I don't know why it's not in
 
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
italics for the committee
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it was definitely a rush job my
 
02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:44.650 align:start position:0%
yeah it was definitely a rush job my
apologies

02:50:44.650 --> 02:50:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
the the amendment is can't hear you
 
02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:50.210 align:start position:0%
the the amendment is can't hear you
representative

02:50:50.210 --> 02:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment is repealing and
 
02:50:52.319 --> 02:50:55.429 align:start position:0%
the amendment is repealing and
reenacting

02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:55.439 --> 02:50:57.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:50:57.230 --> 02:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:00.290 --> 02:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
when they do that it's a lot harder for
 
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:16.429 --> 02:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative said there's a whole
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
bunch of things crossed out on page five
 
02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
that was in the original Amendment based
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the requests of the Lottery
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
Commission is that correct that is
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
correct but again I don't have my my
 
02:51:30.290 --> 02:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
notes copy I left it with OLX so I don't
 
02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:38.210 align:start position:0%
notes copy I left it with OLX so I don't
know

02:51:38.210 --> 02:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:40.250 --> 02:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
we the committee should have all
 
02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
received an email that confirmed through
 
02:51:44.150 --> 02:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
Valerie King at Lottery that they're
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're uh concerns were addressed in
 
02:51:53.090 --> 02:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:57.950 --> 02:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:59.690 --> 02:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
the four places that I've found thank
 
02:52:03.050 --> 02:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh include on page one
 
02:52:06.170 --> 02:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
under Roman numeral two
 
02:52:10.969 --> 02:52:10.979 align:start position:0%
that's the reference to RSA 541a
 
02:52:13.550 --> 02:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
and then further down the page
 
02:52:16.929 --> 02:52:16.939 align:start position:0%
under number 5
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
287- D colon 8 the end of that paragraph
 
02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:27.060 --> 02:52:27.889 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:52:27.889 --> 02:52:27.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
then the one at
 
02:52:32.630 --> 02:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
eight six
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh one at the end of the paragraph there
 
02:52:39.050 --> 02:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
again referencing 541a
 
02:52:39.060 --> 02:52:40.490 align:start position:0%
again referencing 541a
and

02:52:40.490 --> 02:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
under seven Roman numeral two
 
02:52:47.410 --> 02:52:47.420 align:start position:0%
at the second part of that paragraph
 
02:52:51.290 --> 02:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
541 a is that yes and that one's in
 
02:52:53.570 --> 02:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
italics for some strange reason so yeah
 
02:52:55.610 --> 02:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
it's confusing
 
02:53:07.490 --> 02:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.330 --> 02:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
oops okay so we have
 
02:53:11.340 --> 02:53:13.130 align:start position:0%
oops okay so we have
Amendment

02:53:13.130 --> 02:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
1024 before us which has been moved and

seconded
 
02:53:22.309 --> 02:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
if there's no more conversation on that
 
02:53:24.170 --> 02:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
we'll wait for the clerk to get ready
 
02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:25.070 align:start position:0%
we'll wait for the clerk to get ready

02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't keeping up all of my duty
 
02:53:35.410 --> 02:53:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:38.269 --> 02:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
2023-1024h and who moved the new second
 
02:53:41.330 --> 02:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative Doucette moved it and
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%

02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay now
 
02:54:50.210 --> 02:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
we have some confusion about another
 
02:54:52.370 --> 02:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
amendment and and just so you know the
 
02:54:53.809 --> 02:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
chair does not have to take all
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendments but I will of course if you
 
02:54:57.889 --> 02:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
have one ready well
 
02:55:02.210 --> 02:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
I I don't because what I what I asked
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
for them to draft was just for section
 
02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.290 align:start position:0%
for them to draft was just for section
18.

02:55:08.290 --> 02:55:08.300 align:start position:0%
18.
 
02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
are you looking at the original Bill 18
 
02:55:14.510 --> 02:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at the original bill
 
02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:19.010 align:start position:0%
if you look at the original bill
so

02:55:19.010 --> 02:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:19.020 --> 02:55:20.389 align:start position:0%
 
actually

02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:55:27.469 --> 02:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the moratorium
 
02:55:27.479 --> 02:55:28.429 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the moratorium
thing

02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I asked for them to change the date
 
02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:34.010 align:start position:0%
so I asked for them to change the date
from

02:55:34.010 --> 02:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:55:36.530 --> 02:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
what I thought was
 
02:55:41.809 --> 02:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024 to January 1st 2025 and
 
02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
and they didn't draft it right they
 
02:55:47.690 --> 02:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
changed it so the whole bill was except
 
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
for one piece was going to have that
 
02:55:52.670 --> 02:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
date so I don't have an amendment to do
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
that whenever possible normally we
 
02:55:57.290 --> 02:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be under such a deadline but we

representative okay representative
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
Doucette uh would you care to

speak to your motion
 
02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
this committee's done a great amount of
 
02:56:34.429 --> 02:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
work on this uh this is a
 
02:56:36.290 --> 02:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
a pretty
 
02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
deep subject but in a nutshell it kind
 
02:56:41.570 --> 02:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
of gives us a it keeps Pace there's a
 
02:56:44.990 --> 02:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
lot of housekeeping in this uh
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
it keeps us in Pace with the uh the
 
02:56:51.610 --> 02:56:51.620 align:start position:0%
lottery as far as the max bet
 
02:56:53.830 --> 02:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:56:56.510 --> 02:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
addresses uh some technical issues that
 
02:56:56.520 --> 02:56:59.030 align:start position:0%
addresses uh some technical issues that
were

02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:02.530 --> 02:57:02.540 align:start position:0%
laid out by Lottery and it also ensures
 
02:57:05.330 --> 02:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
02:57:08.330 --> 02:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
the HHR game
 
02:57:11.330 --> 02:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh stays in control
 
02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:12.410 align:start position:0%
uh stays in control
uh

02:57:12.410 --> 02:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
 
02:57:24.290 --> 02:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:27.410 --> 02:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
I I have a concern about this and it's
 
02:57:29.269 --> 02:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
been expressed
 
02:57:32.690 --> 02:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
before but my concern remains it's not
 
02:57:36.290 --> 02:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
addressed by the amendment at all
 
02:57:39.050 --> 02:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
um and as background I think it's a good
 
02:57:41.349 --> 02:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill I
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have supported it
 
02:57:47.450 --> 02:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
but there is an issue for me and it is
 
02:57:52.490 --> 02:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
the it is uh the effect of section 18 of
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:58.730 --> 02:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
which repeals
 
02:57:58.740 --> 02:57:59.389 align:start position:0%
which repeals
um

02:57:59.389 --> 02:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:01.630 --> 02:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
the provision
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
that sunseted you have to go through
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
various steps here the sunset at the
 
02:58:11.830 --> 02:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
provision that limits
 
02:58:16.269 --> 02:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
the operation of these facilities to
 
02:58:20.570 --> 02:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
entities that were already in business
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
um back when the
 
02:58:25.450 --> 02:58:25.460 align:start position:0%
historic racing
 
02:58:28.250 --> 02:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
law was first enacted
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:58:34.490 --> 02:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
just so that's clearly in everyone's
 
02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:36.550 align:start position:0%
just so that's clearly in everyone's
mind

02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
that provision which this this bill this
 
02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:41.870 align:start position:0%
that provision which this this bill this
bill

02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:58:46.250 --> 02:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
would continue in effect in perpetuity
 
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh says that in order to be eligible for
 
02:58:52.969 --> 02:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
a license to sell paramutual pools on
 
02:58:54.530 --> 02:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
historic races
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
an applicant shall have been game
 
02:58:59.710 --> 02:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
operator employer licensed under RSA
 
02:59:05.330 --> 02:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
287d as of May 1 2020 and still licensed
 
02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
as of the effective date of this section
 
02:59:10.849 --> 02:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
provided such sales are within the
 
02:59:14.090 --> 02:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
enclosure of a facility at which the
 
02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:15.230 align:start position:0%
enclosure of a facility at which the
licensee

02:59:15.230 --> 02:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
02:59:18.670 --> 02:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
holds its license activities under RSA
 
02:59:21.889 --> 02:59:21.899 align:start position:0%
287d and that such facility is located
 
02:59:24.170 --> 02:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
within the city or town in which the
 
02:59:30.349 --> 02:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:30.359 --> 02:59:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
and an application that is approved by
 
02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission and a license
 
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is granted shall not be permitted
 
02:59:40.730 --> 02:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
to be transferred or sold so this
 
02:59:43.250 --> 02:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
freezes in place
 
02:59:48.889 --> 02:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
um The Limited number of entities that
 
02:59:48.899 --> 02:59:49.790 align:start position:0%
um The Limited number of entities that
can

02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:59:53.690 --> 02:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
engage in historic gaming in a way that
 
02:59:55.610 --> 02:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
I think is
 
02:59:59.630 --> 02:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
is Highly Questionable and should at the
 
03:00:02.450 --> 03:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
very least be subject to a careful
 
03:00:02.460 --> 03:00:03.490 align:start position:0%
very least be subject to a careful
review

03:00:03.490 --> 03:00:03.500 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:00:08.090 --> 03:00:08.100 align:start position:0%
as a separate and distinct issue
 
03:00:10.250 --> 03:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
um the difficulty I have with this
 
03:00:13.610 --> 03:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
section is that it it goes to the
 
03:00:15.410 --> 03:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
opposite uh in the opposite direction
 
03:00:19.550 --> 03:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
and uh continues the uh
 
03:00:23.330 --> 03:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh limitation of licensees
 
03:00:27.670 --> 03:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh without any end point
 
03:00:31.010 --> 03:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
there is as we know
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
um or some of us know a bill that's past
 
03:00:35.950 --> 03:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
03:00:40.730 --> 03:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
SB 51 that sets up a commission and that
 
03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:42.250 align:start position:0%
SB 51 that sets up a commission and that
that

03:00:42.250 --> 03:00:42.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:45.650 --> 03:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
changes the date at which this limit
 
03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:48.190 align:start position:0%
changes the date at which this limit
limitation

03:00:48.190 --> 03:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
03:00:52.030 --> 03:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
would come to an end
 
03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:53.650 align:start position:0%
would come to an end
and

03:00:53.650 --> 03:00:53.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:57.410 --> 03:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
without that date this this limitation
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
would end at the uh I think it's the end
 
03:01:02.750 --> 03:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
of this uh
 
03:01:06.849 --> 03:01:06.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.809 --> 03:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
so I think that uh I I would have
 
03:01:13.849 --> 03:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
welcomed an amendment I gather that
 
03:01:13.859 --> 03:01:16.990 align:start position:0%
welcomed an amendment I gather that
representative

03:01:16.990 --> 03:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:19.790 --> 03:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
fellows was trying to get such an
 
03:01:22.570 --> 03:01:22.580 align:start position:0%
amendment that would have
 
03:01:25.389 --> 03:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
extended this limitation for just
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
another year I would have welcomed one
 
03:01:30.290 --> 03:01:30.300 align:start position:0%
that extended it for two years as does
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 51 so that we could get our
 
03:01:36.830 --> 03:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
really focus on this question but we
 
03:01:39.170 --> 03:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
don't have those before us so I'm really
 
03:01:43.450 --> 03:01:43.460 align:start position:0%
left with uh no option but to
 
03:01:47.389 --> 03:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
oppose the ought to pass
 
03:01:50.570 --> 03:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
um Motion in the hope that we can get to
 
03:01:52.370 --> 03:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
the point where we can retain the bill
 
03:01:54.490 --> 03:01:54.500 align:start position:0%
and work on it
 
03:01:58.130 --> 03:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
and get something in place
 
03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:05.090 --> 03:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
other comments representative horse
 
03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair representative
 
03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:09.349 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair representative
Ames

03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
03:02:11.090 --> 03:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why we couldn't let
 
03:02:13.550 --> 03:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the house versions get
 
03:02:16.010 --> 03:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
worked out in conference
 
03:02:18.050 --> 03:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
I mean I like the fact that we're
 
03:02:19.969 --> 03:02:19.979 align:start position:0%
locking this in and it's not going to
 
03:02:22.969 --> 03:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
get spread through all these communities
 
03:02:25.969 --> 03:02:25.979 align:start position:0%
and you know basement operations or
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
whatever it could be so that part I like
 
03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
and as far as the date I agree with you
 
03:02:32.929 --> 03:02:32.939 align:start position:0%
I mean why can't we just let the Senate
 
03:02:35.330 --> 03:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
and the house work that out at a you
 
03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:36.349 align:start position:0%
and the house work that out at a you
know

03:02:36.349 --> 03:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
shortly it's going to happen shortly
 
03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
right crossover days just around the
 
03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:40.849 align:start position:0%
right crossover days just around the
corner

03:02:40.849 --> 03:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
corner
 
03:02:43.250 --> 03:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's a good question I
 
03:02:47.630 --> 03:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:49.250 --> 03:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
I guess there are two things I want to
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
say one is I agree with you
 
03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see
 
03:02:56.349 --> 03:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
um these operations
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
on every corner of every city or town or
 
03:03:02.809 --> 03:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
whatever wherever they may choose to go
 
03:03:05.630 --> 03:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a limit
 
03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
um should there be just I think it's 14
 
03:03:11.170 --> 03:03:11.180 align:start position:0%
right now besides that we're in place
 
03:03:15.170 --> 03:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
and should they all be uh frozen into
 
03:03:17.210 --> 03:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
the city or town where they are
 
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
currently located
 
03:03:21.950 --> 03:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't think so
 
03:03:25.630 --> 03:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
um maybe there needs to be some level of
 
03:03:28.250 --> 03:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
monopolization allowed which is
 
03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
essentially what that would do but that
 
03:03:33.170 --> 03:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
seems kind of crazy to me uh the one
 
03:03:34.910 --> 03:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's in here
 
03:03:37.370 --> 03:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
um I think it is worth looking at on the
 
03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
second part of your
 
03:03:42.530 --> 03:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
your question your what you've observed
 
03:03:45.050 --> 03:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
is that there is this opportunity to go
 
03:03:49.370 --> 03:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
into eventually a conference with the
 
03:03:52.730 --> 03:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
Senate and I've never really liked the
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
idea of endorsing something that I don't
 
03:03:55.319 --> 03:03:56.530 align:start position:0%
idea of endorsing something that I don't
like

03:03:56.530 --> 03:03:56.540 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
as a way of getting into a conference
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
where we might lose so I don't really
 
03:04:05.330 --> 03:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
want to go down that that pathway
 
03:04:06.650 --> 03:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
that's me
 
03:04:08.750 --> 03:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative oh sorry representative
 
03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:10.190 align:start position:0%
representative oh sorry representative
Spielberg

03:04:10.190 --> 03:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
Spielberg
 
03:04:12.349 --> 03:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of the bill and we'll vote
 
03:04:16.250 --> 03:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
for it but I just want to go on record
 
03:04:19.070 --> 03:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
with a concern and if this is unfounded
 
03:04:21.469 --> 03:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
and someone can straighten me out that
 
03:04:24.290 --> 03:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
would be great but
 
03:04:26.210 --> 03:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
both the bill
 
03:04:29.809 --> 03:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
and the amendment delete specific
 
03:04:29.819 --> 03:04:32.809 align:start position:0%
and the amendment delete specific
instances

03:04:32.809 --> 03:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
instances
 
03:04:32.819 --> 03:04:34.610 align:start position:0%
instances
of

03:04:34.610 --> 03:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
what would constitute a minor or a
 
03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:39.769 align:start position:0%
what would constitute a minor or a
moderate

03:04:39.769 --> 03:04:39.779 align:start position:0%
moderate
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
or a major violation
 
03:04:45.710 --> 03:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
and by doing that
 
03:04:48.290 --> 03:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
I understand there may be some deference
 
03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
to to The Liquor Commission excuse me
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission to to determine
 
03:04:55.610 --> 03:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
that in rulemaking
 
03:04:58.370 --> 03:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
but we leave them completely unguided
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
these distinctions are not incidental a
 
03:05:05.050 --> 03:05:05.060 align:start position:0%
minor or a moderate or a major violation
 
03:05:07.969 --> 03:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
each have a completely different range
 
03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
of fines
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
and that's about as vague
 
03:05:17.690 --> 03:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
and uncertain phraseology as you can
 
03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
possibly imagine
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
minor moderate and major
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
are proportional
 
03:05:26.929 --> 03:05:26.939 align:start position:0%
to what
 
03:05:30.650 --> 03:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
and so I'm not sure why
 
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
the bill has deleted examples
 
03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
those examples did not limit the uh the
 
03:05:40.250 --> 03:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission because in each case
 
03:05:43.849 --> 03:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
it says may include but is not limited
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
to so in either case the the Lottery
 
03:05:49.870 --> 03:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
Commission had the
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
discretion to create rules that might
 
03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
cite other examples but at least these
 
03:05:58.750 --> 03:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
gave guidance in terms of
 
03:06:00.889 --> 03:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
proportionality and what we thought each
 
03:06:02.750 --> 03:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
level was so
 
03:06:02.760 --> 03:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
level was so
um

03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's something I I unfortunately was
 
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
unable to attend the work session and
 
03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have the benefit of being able to
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
lay that out here if there are any
 
03:06:16.610 --> 03:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
answers but these are not terms that are
 
03:06:18.530 --> 03:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere in the statute so far
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware they're certainly not
 
03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
evidently defined in this bill
 
03:06:24.410 --> 03:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know I would just want to be on
 
03:06:25.849 --> 03:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
record that that's something that I
 
03:06:28.429 --> 03:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
think we might need to revisit
 
03:06:29.870 --> 03:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative you said you have your
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
head up yes it and just uh I wasn't
 
03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
going to bring up the the other body but
 
03:06:36.410 --> 03:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
we do know that there's a mirrored piece
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
of legislation over there with a date
 
03:06:42.290 --> 03:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
specific and and there is a process for
 
03:06:42.300 --> 03:06:43.790 align:start position:0%
specific and and there is a process for
that

03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:06:43.800 --> 03:06:44.570 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:06:44.570 --> 03:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:46.610 --> 03:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
as mentioned earlier I just want to
 
03:06:48.889 --> 03:06:48.899 align:start position:0%
clarify one thing because this can be a
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
confusing issue this is not
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh putting a moratorium on charitable
 
03:06:57.530 --> 03:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
gaming this is very specific to one
 
03:07:01.429 --> 03:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
electronic game that we passed into law
 
03:07:03.170 --> 03:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
03:07:07.190 --> 03:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
and we in in many people's purview
 
03:07:09.530 --> 03:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
don't believe we've had the time the
 
03:07:12.050 --> 03:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
time that it was uh rolled out and the
 
03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
time to review the impacts of that game
 
03:07:16.969 --> 03:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
and this is kind of putting the brakes
 
03:07:20.929 --> 03:07:20.939 align:start position:0%
on so this doesn't mean uh it negates
 
03:07:23.450 --> 03:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
the the ability for any
 
03:07:25.490 --> 03:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
person to become a charitable game
 
03:07:27.830 --> 03:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
operator and take on those Charities and
 
03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:29.090 align:start position:0%
operator and take on those Charities and
and

03:07:29.090 --> 03:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
generate revenue for both the Charities
 
03:07:34.370 --> 03:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
and the state it just isolates this one
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
specific game until we find out what the
 
03:07:39.769 --> 03:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
effect and the saturation point and
 
03:07:42.889 --> 03:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
other issues are so I I don't want to
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
continue to punt this down the road and
 
03:07:47.929 --> 03:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
I think we'll come together with what
 
03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate produces but this is the
 
03:07:52.010 --> 03:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
house side of things and we should dig
 
03:07:54.170 --> 03:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
our heels in and and say we need to take
 
03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
a look at this and it's not going to
 
03:07:58.429 --> 03:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
negate charitable gaming
 
03:08:01.490 --> 03:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
you know specifically it's one game
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
one specific issue and we need to to
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
take a good look at that and the best
 
03:08:10.130 --> 03:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
way to do it is is to step back stop it
 
03:08:14.090 --> 03:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:14.100 --> 03:08:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:08:16.010 --> 03:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:08:20.269 --> 03:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
a hard time articulating
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
this so I may stumble a little bit as I
 
03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:23.750 align:start position:0%
this so I may stumble a little bit as I
go

03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:24.889 align:start position:0%
go
um

03:08:24.889 --> 03:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:26.450 --> 03:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
03:08:32.030 --> 03:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:35.450 --> 03:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
premium cigars bill was that it had been
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
as I understood it historically set up
 
03:08:40.190 --> 03:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
to protect an industry that we had here
 
03:08:42.130 --> 03:08:42.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:08:44.330 --> 03:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
the this bill
 
03:08:44.340 --> 03:08:45.650 align:start position:0%
the this bill
which

03:08:45.650 --> 03:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
at least at this point says that the
 
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
only people who are that we will limit
 
03:08:54.889 --> 03:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
the number of licenses for gaming
 
03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
um is protectionist because as I
 
03:09:01.370 --> 03:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
understand it if you have a license now
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
chances are pretty good that you'll be
 
03:09:05.690 --> 03:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
able to continue with your license
 
03:09:07.790 --> 03:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
and if we're doing that I would very
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.210 --> 03:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
provide those licenses issue those
 
03:09:17.769 --> 03:09:17.779 align:start position:0%
licenses to New Hampshire folks
 
03:09:23.090 --> 03:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.610 --> 03:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
I understand that's not the scope of
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
what this bill is addressing right now
 
03:09:31.490 --> 03:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
but it does provide some concern to me I
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
did get a call from someone from the
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
Boston Billiards
 
03:09:35.279 --> 03:09:37.130 align:start position:0%
Boston Billiards
um

03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
group in Nashua yesterday telling me
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
that they had been bought out by the
 
03:09:45.530 --> 03:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
Jacob brothers who own the Boston Bruins
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
and they live in Buffalo which really is
 
03:09:49.790 --> 03:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
New England which
 
03:09:51.290 --> 03:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
I found
 
03:09:51.300 --> 03:09:53.389 align:start position:0%
I found
interesting

03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
03:09:53.399 --> 03:09:54.469 align:start position:0%
interesting
um

03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
but I am concerned that if we are going
 
03:10:01.250 --> 03:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
to be protectionist and I tend to agree
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see games on every
 
03:10:05.809 --> 03:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
street corner or even every other street
 
03:10:07.969 --> 03:10:07.979 align:start position:0%
corner but I would like to see if we can
 
03:10:10.730 --> 03:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
figure out a way at some point to make
 
03:10:12.110 --> 03:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we're at least giving
 
03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
preferential treatment to qualified New
 
03:10:17.929 --> 03:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire operators thank you
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
other comments represent Mommy
 
03:10:21.359 --> 03:10:23.090 align:start position:0%
other comments represent Mommy
yes

03:10:23.090 --> 03:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm having difficulty with this too
 
03:10:28.610 --> 03:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
the paragraphs that representative Ames
 
03:10:29.950 --> 03:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
showed me
 
03:10:33.170 --> 03:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
essentially the way it's worded is I
 
03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
understand it on
 
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
you we could end up with one very large
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
operator forcing or buying the others
 
03:10:46.610 --> 03:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
out and there would be one license in
 
03:10:48.349 --> 03:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
on and if we're looking at
 
03:10:56.090 --> 03:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
at a total ban
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I have a great deal of trouble
 
03:11:01.490 --> 03:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
having watched them over the years with
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
Committees of conference there are times
 
03:11:06.290 --> 03:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
when the leadership wants a particular
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
outcome and they just remove a person
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
and put another person on that will do
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
what they want that outcome to be and it
 
03:11:15.769 --> 03:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
looks very different from what the
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee had
 
03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:18.889 align:start position:0%
committee had
um

03:11:18.889 --> 03:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:18.899 --> 03:11:21.710 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:23.929 align:start position:0%
and
on

03:11:23.929 --> 03:11:23.939 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:11:26.210 --> 03:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure what to do at this
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
point because on it's more probable that
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
um this provision
 
03:11:37.610 --> 03:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
number 18 is going to go the way of the
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
dodo as soon as it hits the Senate and
 
03:11:42.769 --> 03:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
that one way or another they won't
 
03:11:44.269 --> 03:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
discuss it in the committee of
 
03:11:44.279 --> 03:11:45.889 align:start position:0%
discuss it in the committee of
conference

03:11:45.889 --> 03:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
conference
 
03:11:49.610 --> 03:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
but it is amazing
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
quite a concern given the way that that
 
03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
that is worded which was worded when
 
03:11:57.230 --> 03:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
people were thinking that in four years
 
03:12:01.010 --> 03:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
it was going to be expanded
 
03:12:06.530 --> 03:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:08.630 --> 03:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
any more discussion
 
03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:12:15.469 --> 03:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
um I can somebody explain to me
 
03:12:18.590 --> 03:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
section 18 because I thought that was
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of the corrections that was going to
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
be made what does it just tell me
 
03:12:24.889 --> 03:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
exactly what it does and when
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't in the amendment it's
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:34.370 --> 03:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet I'm not exactly
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
sure the correction you're referring to
 
03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
on in section 18.
 
03:12:46.250 --> 03:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'm asking what was the
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
correction you were referring to
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure
 
03:12:55.250 --> 03:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
what is eligible in 2024 I thought when
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion you were going to
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
put in
 
03:13:03.050 --> 03:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
either July 1 or January 1.
 
03:13:03.060 --> 03:13:06.710 align:start position:0%
either July 1 or January 1.
or

03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:08.929 --> 03:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
this is back from me so what does this
 
03:13:08.939 --> 03:13:10.790 align:start position:0%
this is back from me so what does this
do

03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:13:12.889 --> 03:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about the
 
03:13:18.650 --> 03:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
because it's not in the amendment it's
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:29.210 --> 03:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would
 
03:13:34.010 --> 03:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
say it's effective on on Passage
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
03:13:36.479 --> 03:13:46.510 align:start position:0%
60 days
yes

03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
the the way it's written my
 
03:13:50.690 --> 03:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
understanding it would repeal that
 
03:13:53.389 --> 03:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
statute and it would be on the effective
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
date of this
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
it's not 18.
 
03:14:03.479 --> 03:14:05.269 align:start position:0%
it's not 18.
well

03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
section 18 was in I don't believe your
 
03:14:11.279 --> 03:14:12.769 align:start position:0%
section 18 was in I don't believe your
Amendment

03:14:12.769 --> 03:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:14:17.389 --> 03:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
touched section 18.
 
03:14:20.510 --> 03:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:23.389 --> 03:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
my my Amendment did not put the Billet
 
03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:42.170 --> 03:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
so it says repeal
 
03:14:42.180 --> 03:14:44.210 align:start position:0%
so it says repeal
20.

03:14:44.210 --> 03:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
20.
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
forgive me representative it would
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
repeal uh
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
2021 uh 66 colon 10 relative to the
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
licenses it would negate that historic
 
03:15:00.230 --> 03:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
horse racing uh eligibility
 
03:15:04.490 --> 03:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh in that would stop in uh 2024 would
 
03:15:07.010 --> 03:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
repeal that and it would revert to the
 
03:15:08.510 --> 03:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
language in this piece of legislation
 
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
would that would be effective in 60 days
 
03:15:18.230 --> 03:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:21.170 --> 03:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
any other comments before we take the
 
03:15:25.010 --> 03:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
vote Yes so when does it get repealed
 
03:15:28.250 --> 03:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
according to the amendment 60 days after
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
passage right
 
03:15:32.570 --> 03:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
well this bill would repeal it the the
 
03:15:35.210 --> 03:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
original bill will repeal that effective
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
because it's not section 9 and 10.
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
is that how
 
03:15:44.330 --> 03:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
if it
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative spillsburg yeah I think I
 
03:15:48.410 --> 03:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
can clarify
 
03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
in Reading uh section 18 on line eight
 
03:15:55.610 --> 03:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
page nine that eligible in 2024 has
 
03:15:58.670 --> 03:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with repeal that is from
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
the historic horse racing statute
 
03:16:05.090 --> 03:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
so the effective date is entirely
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
governed by the amended section 19. oh
 
03:16:13.610 --> 03:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay I was thinking that eligible in
 
03:16:15.590 --> 03:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:16:17.269 --> 03:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
I thought it had something to do with
 
03:16:20.570 --> 03:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
facilities eligible now okay okay thank
 
03:16:20.580 --> 03:16:22.250 align:start position:0%
facilities eligible now okay okay thank
you

03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:16:24.050 --> 03:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
we have attorneys drafting this is
 
03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
attorney speaker the clarity for lack of
 
03:16:28.929 --> 03:16:28.939 align:start position:0%
a better term the moratorium that's on
 
03:16:31.490 --> 03:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
HHR right now that's what that date's
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
03:16:37.570 --> 03:16:37.580 align:start position:0%
so the moratorium goes away
 
03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
on on in in the uh in 607 it becomes
 
03:16:42.300 --> 03:16:46.490 align:start position:0%
on on in in the uh in 607 it becomes
permanent

03:16:46.490 --> 03:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:50.090 --> 03:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
60 days after Passage
 
03:16:55.370 --> 03:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:02.750 --> 03:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.809 --> 03:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion before us is
 
03:17:09.889 --> 03:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended by Amendment
 
03:17:15.889 --> 03:17:15.899 align:start position:0%

03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
no we voted on ought to pass as amended

we already had voted on the amendment so
 
03:19:12.530 --> 03:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think we're good
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
um so that will now close the exact
 
03:19:19.389 --> 03:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
section on House Bill 607 and uh
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%

no it starts at 9am for everyone
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
and it could be a long day guys but I
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
don't think we have any ways and means
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
stuff on the calendar so we've got it a
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
little easier
 
03:19:46.969 --> 03:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
um and then don't forget next Tuesday at
 
03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:49.080 align:start position:0%

session on House Bill 639
 
03:19:54.590 --> 03:19:54.600 align:start position:0%

03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
read the bill again and become prepared
 
03:19:59.809 --> 03:19:59.819 align:start position:0%

03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
