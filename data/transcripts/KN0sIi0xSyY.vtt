[Music]

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
because uh immigration is handled by the
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
federal government under the commerce
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
clause all encryption
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
regulations are handled by the federal
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
government and a lot of this information
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out during the public
 
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.950 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out during the public
hearing

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
is already public information it can
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
already be compiled by
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
our non-profits right so school
 
00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.589 align:start position:0%
our non-profits right so school
districts

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
municipal governments and even non other
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofits publish
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
information on how um primary uh
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
primary earners within families how it
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
felt that they're deported so
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
all this information all this research
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
can already be done it doesn't need to
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
be paid for by new hampshire
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and um even if we did
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
such a study there's not much our state
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
because it's out of our jurisdiction
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that would have to be
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
handled by our federal government so
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
seeing as
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
this is a federal issue and seeing as
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
this information can already be compiled
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
by any non-profit
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the country can compile our
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
information i find the uh i don't think
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
really services our constituents as a as
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%

services or handouts
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%

increased his work hours as did the
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
mother one of the children who i
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
personally investigated had a
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
particularly rough time
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
missed his dad terribly his grades began
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
to suffer in school
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
without the dad the family had to rely
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
on services from the town the school the
 
00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:18.949 align:start position:0%
on services from the town the school the
state

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
i talked with the school counselor told
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
me that two of the children in the
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
family have been doing fine
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
until the father was taken away
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
requiring all sorts of
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
intervention in school services iep and
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
so on
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
taking mr ayala from his family not only
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
created a
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
psychological damage to the kids but it
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
was a bad economic
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
call for the state of new hampshire a
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
hard-working guy making a living
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
supporting his kids and wife one moment
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
a burden to the state the next after
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
separating him from his family of
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
american citizens
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
um so while i'd like you to open your
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
heart to this
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
family's plight i'd like to say
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
practically that this type of
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
separation is bad business for new
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have critical workforce
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
problems from finding someone who
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
you can't find someone right now to
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
repair your roof in the middle of the
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
winter and

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.910 align:start position:0%
in southwest new hampshire i know that
personally

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a leak in your in your roof
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
to high-tech foreign firms upstate
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
in the lakes region who are unable to
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
attract i.t
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
professionals we desperately need to
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
increase our workforce here in new
 
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:22.630 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
deporting bread winners who are parents
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
to children who are american citizens is
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
not going to help
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
if you're concerned about the economic
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
consequences and if you can open your
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
heart to the plight of these families
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%

get everybody fumbles the last name um
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
but um i just wanted to also raise my
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
objection to the itl
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
um and i just would like to to really
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
echo what our what my colleague
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
um representative walker would said you
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
know i think
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
um while well
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think it would show an imperative on
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state if we were to
 
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.230 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state if we were to
analyze

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
analyze
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
what some of these what some of the
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
resources we have to use
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
for when when a breadwinner is deported
 
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
for when when a breadwinner is deported
from

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and you know a lot of families here
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
are mixed status families they're not
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
just single not
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
not everyone in the family is
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
undocumented we have we have family
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
members who are in the process of
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
of receiving visas or who are already
 
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
of receiving visas or who are already
citizens

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not a black or white
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
issue it is a
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
very immigration in this country is a
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
very great issue
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
where it is not just oh like there are
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
there are there's this group and then
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
there's this group no it is
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
it is much more complex than that and i
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
as somebody who's worked within the
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
system for the last couple of years
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um i want to make sure that we do our
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
due diligence
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
in studying the effects that we have
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
deportations have on on family members
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
in this state um and so
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
i am i i i would support the overturning
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
of the itl
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
to not to pass and like i said this is
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know we have a humanitarian issue
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
with what's going on with covet and the
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh homeless people like the number of
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
homelessness that's that's
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's shooting up the number
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the the mental health crisis that's
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
going on in
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
in this not only in the state but in
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
this country um and so
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
um i would really i guess i really urge
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
you all to to
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
to look at um to look at changing this
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
from an ital to not to pass but um
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%

the input from both of the colleagues
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
from across the isle but i just
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
i still we need to remember that the
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
question at the end of the day is about
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not to study the issue
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
while both tests you know both the
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
arguments that we just heard were very
 
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.949 align:start position:0%
arguments that we just heard were very
strongly

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
strongly
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
you know against the idea of deporting
 
00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:30.230 align:start position:0%
you know against the idea of deporting
primary

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
earners we still have to remember that
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's still a federal issue
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
and two testimonies last week explain
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
that this data can already be compiled
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
by any private group that's against the
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
deportation of primary earners
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
and a study in the state compiling this
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
information doesn't change
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the overall issue of our immigration
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
system that's already going to be
 
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
system that's already going to be
addressed

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
by the biden administration over the
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
coming months
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's just to collect this information
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
that's already available
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i think that's the biggest thing we
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
have to remember do we want the state to
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
be doing this and is this within the
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
state's jurisdiction
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
or is this a federal issue and should
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
this say you know if any government
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
entities can be handling it should it be
 
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.069 align:start position:0%
entities can be handling it should it be
those

00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
who actually regulate immigration i
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
believe in my personal opinion a number
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
this is more of a federal issue and it
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
should be dressed at the federal level
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i hope that someone brings some kind
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
of language like this through chris
 
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.189 align:start position:0%
of language like this through chris

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
pappas
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say i rest bye
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i'm getting it up on
 
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:41.450 align:start position:0%
my phone now so i should be hoping
 
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:52.829 align:start position:0%
my phone now so i should be hoping
[Music]

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:58.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any other hands up
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:09.430 align:start position:0%
 
representation

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh this bill came to us before and the
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
past year and of course under
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
the democrat watch it was out to pass
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
but what we realized
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
and we already know that the
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
constitution is the federalist
 
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
constitution is the federalist
responsibility

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
federal government uh responsibility so
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this is a feel-good bill
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh where we're going to get together
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay mileage to state
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
representatives during the summer
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
i mean we can't even get democrats but
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
yet they're going to meet over the
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
summer again
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
i guess to assume or something i don't
 
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:39.570 align:start position:0%
but anyways um
 
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.949 align:start position:0%
but anyways um

00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know we recommended before that uh
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer dollars
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
once again for the constitution the
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
federal government is responsible for
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
all immigration enforcement matters
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
and custom enforcement so ice comes
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
under federal law
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
everyday immigration matters such as
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
application processes
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
are handled by the u.s citizenship and
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
immigration services
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
or the uscis customs and border
 
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.309 align:start position:0%
or the uscis customs and border
protection

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
is also a player guide not only the u.s
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
border but a broad swath of land within
 
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.150 align:start position:0%
border but a broad swath of land within
it

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
plus other points of entry such as the
 
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
plus other points of entry such as the
seaports

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
seaports
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
the study will have no effect on new
 
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:16.710 align:start position:0%
the study will have no effect on new
hampshire

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
it will just lead back to the federal
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
government and constitution
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
very simple that was my verb that i just
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
read that i
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
did done the last time uh this bill came
 
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
did done the last time uh this bill came
forward

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
so i can't you know support this and i
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
support the itl on this here because
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
like i said once again it's a feel good
 
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
like i said once again it's a feel good
tight

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
tight
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
legislation great intentions i wish
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
there was something we could do
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
but really it is not it's a federal
 
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.150 align:start position:0%
but really it is not it's a federal
issue

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
now with the new president uh the
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh they opened up the gates uh the
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
immigration just looking out borders
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
so apparently the federal government
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
here with them in today's world anything
 
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
here with them in today's world anything
goes

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
and they're not concerned with the
 
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels of the taxpayers
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know in different cities and towns
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
so they want the federal government's on
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
it that's all i have
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay um i don't see any other hands up

i see flashing going on here
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay nobody else is looking to represent
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
the show
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
just just for some clarification this
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
makes it so that we're there we're
 
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
makes it so that we're there we're
within

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
federal regulations for um the specific

federal regulations for um the specific
uh

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
the use of force on any national guard
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
facilities so
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
federal governments pass legislation
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're just making it so then our
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
national guard facilities
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
are within such regulations
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you uh once again this
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%

came to us last year was past 14 to

nothing
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um it's a no-brainer

to um move forward with this and without
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%

uh representative you want to speak
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so hp 580 has a good intent to try
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
to bring back
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
some constitutional conservatism to our
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
federal government and to ensure that
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
our state is following
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
such but there's many flaws with it and
 
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.669 align:start position:0%
such but there's many flaws with it and
how

00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
we currently um regulate the federal and
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
state government regulates our national
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
guard as mobilization for duty for
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
example in 1986 the us congress passed
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
the montgomery amendment which
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited state governors from
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
withholding their
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
quote holding their consent to a
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
national guard unit's
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
active duty outside the country because
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
of an objection to the site purpose
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
or schedule of the duty the u.s supreme
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
court unanimously upheld this federal
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
statute in the 1990 case
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
pepperidge the department of defense in
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
2006 congress passed a 2007 national
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
defense authorization act
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
which gave the president the authority
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
to mobilize national guard units
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
within the u.s without the consent of
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
state governors
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
these laws in the site supreme court
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
precedent show us that the federal
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
government has the authority to deploy
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
national guard units
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
as long as such powers are mandated by
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
the constitution or
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
congress even if it's against the
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
governors or the state's desire
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
additionally there's the fear that this
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation could cause the state of new
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire to lose
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
federal funding for our national guard
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
entitled 32 of the federal
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
code section 108 it states quote if
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
within a time fixed by the president a
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
state fails to comply
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
with a requirement of this title or
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
regulation prescribed under this title
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
the national guard
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
of that state is barred in whole or in
 
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
of that state is barred in whole or in
part

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
as the president may prescribe from
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
receiving money or any other aid benefit
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
or privilege
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
authorized by law end quote this means
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
if we mandate that new hampshire's
 
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.269 align:start position:0%
if we mandate that new hampshire's
government

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
governor withhold our national guard
 
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
governor withhold our national guard
units

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
units
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
doing so against federal code then we
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
could lose federal funding
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
so this is a this could be a large risk
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
considering that
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
the president of the united states has
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
given a lot of uh authority
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
in title 32 of the federal code and
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
withholding our funding
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the fact that this bill because of
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
the warning it uses he uses the word
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
shall he use the word ciao for the
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
government for the governor
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's us imposing upon the governor
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
a requirement to withhold um
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
national guard units unless
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
if they feel if the legislature or the
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
governor feels as if
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
screen

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
don't see any evidence to you okay um
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna pass on uh just to
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
reinteract with
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
representatives uh we passed something
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
like this here with the concept
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
of the unconstitutional supreme court
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
like you said

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
executive session on hcr1
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to make a motion to itl

hcr1 i have a motion on the floor the
 
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.029 align:start position:0%
hcr1 i have a motion on the floor the
itl

00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh chairman stalisario
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
i believe that any objective
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
weighing of these comes down heavily on
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
the side
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
of risks and hazards especially heavily
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
does it come down so when the amendments
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
are claimed to be necessary
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
to get the constitution to do what
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
it is written to do i.e constrain the
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
this benefit will obviously not be added
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
to a constitution
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
whose problem is the federal government
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
is ignoring it
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
yet the proponents want us to put our
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
very constitution
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
at risk in order to fix a fault
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is not the constitution any such
 
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.629 align:start position:0%
that is not the constitution any such
proposal

00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
needs to have weighed the risk and
 
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:43.750 align:start position:0%
needs to have weighed the risk and
hazards

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
hazards
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
of such a convention over against
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
its potential for benefits particularly
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
for such benefits as the convention
 
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
for such benefits as the convention
proponents

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
proponents
 
00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
proponents
promise

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that's looking to
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
you see anyone up there with their hands
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah representative
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative of a bunch uh i was going
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
to bring forward an amendment uh
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not new to procedure is it too late
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
to bring forward that amount
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
oh it's not too late but we're gonna
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
once we take a vote
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh we've already got a motion on the
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
floor to itl
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh once they vote if the itl fails
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
then the next motion would be an
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
artifact and then the amendment would be
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
able to come forward
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
i wish i got an email on that video and
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
you got one i don't know i can't speak
 
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.390 align:start position:0%
you got one i don't know i can't speak
forever

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
let's go to the motion here before we
 
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.430 align:start position:0%
let's go to the motion here before we
discuss

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
as you see okay
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
um anyone else looking to speak uh on
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
the motion ito representative
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll say something real brief uh
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
the largest issue with
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
the um with the resolution is the fact
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
no unified within our constitution there
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
is no established rules
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
for how such a convention would work so
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's no established rules for
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
how you would uh pass an amendment you
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
know on the floor there there's no
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
established rules for
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
how many delegates each state would send
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's no established rules for
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
how you would even establish the rules
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
for such a convention so it's such a
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
gray area
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
and it's up to so much ambiguity and
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
even within
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
these resolutions not every single
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
resolution is entirely the same from
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
every state that's been trying
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
to push for uh the article 5 convention
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
on a number of levels for a number of
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we're going to uh
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
touch upon hcr4 after i think another
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing to the
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
termination correct me if i'm wrong but
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
this is a concurrent resolution
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
which i believe it means it has to also
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
go to the senate
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
there we go and the senate
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
most likely will not take up such a
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
resolution they have rules against
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll yield okay uh i'm
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
going to add
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
to this here especially for the freshmen
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire does have a
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
resolution on file for a balanced budget
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay when i was a chair a few years back
 
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
okay when i was a chair a few years back
um

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%

representative mas miller on hcl1
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh is anyone going to be taking this on
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh not that i know of chairman
 
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay i don't think um uh
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
republicans are gonna speak on it you
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
know unless the minority's gonna speak
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
right now i can tell you we're not gonna
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
fight you know
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
speak on the floor you know
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
you might wanna ask a representative le
 
00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
you might wanna ask a representative le
branch

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh i probably will not speak on the
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.829 align:start position:0%
 
hcr4

00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.839 --> 00:43:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
we have a motion it'll do we have any
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
second i said
 
00:43:49.520 --> 00:44:09.990 align:start position:0%
second i said
that

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
yes i will second the motion to itl hdr4
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
we'll go represent the branch the second
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh because he did have his hand up uh
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
so as previously mentioned with hcr1
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
large amount of ambiguity regarding
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
adopting rules for an article 5
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
convention but
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
as already i've already previously
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that but i'll touch upon a
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
different aspect for hcr4
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
in regards to its content which it does
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
not guarantee the objective
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
of its uh of the resolution itself and
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
could actually have contrary results
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
so if you're a conservative who's
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the right to life
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
this could do
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
the exact ops during article 5
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
prevention any conceivable amendments
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
can come to fruition
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
and he suggests a constitutional
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
amendment made by the convention
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
can be later ratified by individual
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
states and if enough individual states
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
ratify the amendments
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
they become adopted in our credit
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
constitution this high
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
this hypothetical convention could
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
suggest amendments that prevent
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
very reasonable limits on abortion
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
procedures or for my more um
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
for my pro-choice members on this
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee to do the exact opposite too
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
it could have extremely stringent
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh regulations upon abortion which might
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
be favorable to some but
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
unfavorable to others and we enter into
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
this article 5
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
convention with a lot of ambiguity for
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
what comes out of it so i think the best
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
way for um
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
for us to handle this kind of policy
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
issue is for us to have debates
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
in our house chamber within committees
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
to have debates in our state senate
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
to sign laws uh to sign
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
bills into law and to then debate in our
 
00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:55.030 align:start position:0%
bills into law and to then debate in our
code

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
over the merits of such laws not to have
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
a debate
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
in an article five convention where
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's no rules for this ambiguity for
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
what will happen
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
or there's ambiguity to final results
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh anyone else looking to speak
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
what that let me just look at something
 
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.349 align:start position:0%
what that let me just look at something
yeah

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay since there's no one else oh did
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
you ever end up
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
no okay uh with that i'll ask the roll
 
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:32.790 align:start position:0%
no okay uh with that i'll ask the roll
call

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
