00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
some time and weber
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
i am here in my residence in walpole and
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
i am alone except for a dog
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
i think we will proceed um
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take up the bills in the
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
order uh in numerical order just so that
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's easier to follow along i used to
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
skip around and i'm i'm going to
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
remind people that normally
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
when we have interim study bills at this
 
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.590 align:start position:0%
when we have interim study bills at this
point

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
we will have had a very robust
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee procedure
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the robust subcommittee chairman
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
will come in and make a recommendation
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
on what happened at subcommittee but we
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
are having the work session right now
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
and each work session will immediately
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
be followed by
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
an executive session on that bill so
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
the first bill we are taking up is house
 
00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.829 align:start position:0%
the first bill we are taking up is house
bill

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
1265 relative to the requirement of
 
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying medical conditions for
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for therapeutic cannabis
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm also going to remind the members
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
just before we start
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
that what we will come out with at the
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
end of this is simply a recommendation
 
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
end of this is simply a recommendation
for

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
further legislation or a
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill is not
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
should not be the subject of further
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
legislation so with that
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
um we have house bill 1265 before us
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has a comment they want
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
they can either wave at me as
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
representative knark is doing or raise
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
their hand
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
via the little raise their hand function
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
but i have seen representative knark
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to recognize him thank you
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
um basically just to remember i'm
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
currently serving as the chair of the
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
board and we're tasked with overseeing
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
issues including qualifying conditions
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
and that medical oversight board is
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
composed of the medical director of
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
dhhs a qualifying patient a
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative in atc and 10 different
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
medical providers from various fields
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
we discussed this bill in our january
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
2020 meeting
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we voted that this bill should be
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
voted in expedient to legislate
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
eight to zero with two abstentions and
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
there are basically two reasons number
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
that it concludes the words for which
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis is prescribed which we do not
 
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
cannabis is prescribed which we do not
prescribe

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis as providers we simply certify
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
that the person can obtain
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis through an alternative
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
treatment center the second
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
is the wording of stating a qualified
 
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
is the wording of stating a qualified
medical

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
qualified medical condition means a
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
medical condition diagnosed by a
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
provider for which cannabis
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
is prescribed may include the presence
 
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
is prescribed may include the presence
of

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
really opens the door wide open to
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
allowing anything because it doesn't say
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's restricted to that but it only may
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
include that
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
so we have actually been against the
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
having no qualifying conditions for a
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
couple of basic reasons
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
we feel that uh the current
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh provider community really doesn't
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
have enough
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
skill set in cannabis to know what is
 
00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:37.030 align:start position:0%
skill set in cannabis to know what is
appropriate

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
for use of cannabis and what isn't
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
we we aren't taught this in medically
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
certainly we're taught this in medical
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
school when
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
i was there and i'm not sure how much of
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
it's even taught now
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
granted providers can get the
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
information but
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh we spend hours and hours when we
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
deliberate as our own board with a
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
number of people that are specialists in
 
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.670 align:start position:0%
number of people that are specialists in
this

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
so we feel that the overall provider
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge base is not sufficient to open
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
the door wide open
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
we our work um plan for all of 2020 has
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
been to develop
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
educational provider materials we've
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
been working diligently on that and by
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
the end of the year we expect to have
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
our web page launched
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
with a number of different uh
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
educational materials available for
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
providers we do not
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
demand certification a certification
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
course for
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
qualifying providers in this state some
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
states do we don't
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
so basically the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board thinks this
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
should not go forward
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
and if it's appropriate to make a motion
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
at this time i would
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
move that this uh bill well let's hold
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
on to the motion
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
until we go into okay thank you an
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
actual executive session
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
but yes uh so let me ask if there's
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wants
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair it's just
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
a point of order for my clerking duties
 
00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
a point of order for my clerking duties
the

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
form that i have to fill out for the
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
does include a motion to either
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
recommend or not recommend
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
right um oh
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that you think we could
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
just go right ahead and do the executive
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
session concurrently
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
no if i'm to fill out my paperwork
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
properly which
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not wedded to but if i am to then i
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
would need to record
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
a recommendation of this at the
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then a motion at the executive i
 
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.550 align:start position:0%
and then a motion at the executive i
think

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
so yes representative kirk i gather
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to take
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
two votes on this because we are acting
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee of the whole
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
so i believe that your recommendation
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
was not recommended for further
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
um action is that correct yes that is
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
correct i would move that we should
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
that hb1265 should be not recommended
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
for further legislative action
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay i will second the motion
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry who was that representative
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
marsh would like to second the motion
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative marsh we thank you for
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%

okay i'm unmuted there you go my only
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
reason for raising my hand is i want to
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
raise questions about the word
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
prescription and that's now been taken
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%

oh yes go right ahead representative
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.350 align:start position:0%
i would just like to ask representative
kanerk

00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
kanerk
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
based on his comments about the cannabis
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
oversight board
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
if there's a thought that in the future
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
that doctors will be able to prescribe
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
for any condition they feel is relevant
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
and what and what time frame that might
 
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.789 align:start position:0%
and what and what time frame that might
include

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative you may respond
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
well we would actually never prescribe
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
remember this is a prohibited substance
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
um it's a schedule one substance so we
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
would not actually truly prescribe
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
but it means certify right i don't know
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
the answer to that
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think we would need some follow-up
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
work to find out what level of
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
competence people have developed
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
um our concern has always been people
 
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
um our concern has always been people
becoming

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
becoming
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
even now it falls into two different
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
camps people who never prescribe
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
and people who prescribe relatively
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
easily but we don't want to make
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh providers and decisives who will just
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
prescribe for anything to get the person
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
out of their office
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
or sorry certified all right sorry
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
not prescribed yeah right certify for
 
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.070 align:start position:0%
not prescribed yeah right certify for
anything

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh just to get the person out of their
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
office like they sometimes do for
 
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
office like they sometimes do for
prescribing

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
prescribing
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know sleeping pills um so it is a
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
bit of a concern though it's a little
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
bit more work
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
for certification and it is a one-year
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
certification has to be renewed
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
so there is some actual provider work
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
for doing this and might not be
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
as abused as prescription writing is for
 
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.430 align:start position:0%
as abused as prescription writing is for
many

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
common medications but i'm not sure on
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
that we you know we made a decision when
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
we put in this program
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we would not just open the door
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
that would just be a limiting number of
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh conditions but it is a major uh
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
job of our board is to review these and
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
we have to go back and weed out a number
 
00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
we have to go back and weed out a number
of

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative nurse are there
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%

uh yes just a sidebar on that there was
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
a group of us
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh some at dartmouth and one from
 
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
uh some at dartmouth and one from
vermont

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh about this issue um apparently
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for not having you know
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
um verse and
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
a chapter and verse on this but
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
apparently in the rsa
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
is that physicians can offer guidelines
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh not prescription but guidelines and
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
in that is
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
they have to be followed uh that was in
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
the uh again with the thought
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
that um those that are providing
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh medications for seizures do not want
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
any thc
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
but only cbd's and so
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
that was a guideline that has to be
 
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.350 align:start position:0%
that was a guideline that has to be
followed

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
followed
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
so there is a modification in rsa that
 
00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.110 align:start position:0%
so there is a modification in rsa that
would

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
potentially be expanded but just so
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%

bill
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
1538 creating a commission to develop
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
and implement
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
environmental education outreach and
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
training programs and initiatives
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
for qualified health care professionals
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
relative to environmental
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
is the floor open for a motion to
 
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.230 align:start position:0%
is the floor open for a motion to
approve

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh the floor is open and if you would
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
care to make that motion you may
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
may do so i'd like to move approval
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay so recommended for further action
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
um representative salloway would you
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
care to speak to your
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
um motion uh it's a logical continuation
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
of the work that we've been doing on
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
environmental risk
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
and chronic disease and now it's
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
imperative that we begin to get
 
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.390 align:start position:0%
imperative that we begin to get
information

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
out to our healthcare practitioners
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
to make them aware that the patients
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
that they're seeing
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
are not merely diagnosable but need to
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
be assessed
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
for the environmental risks that have
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
brought them in the first place
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay other comments
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
represent the woods uh
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes now being a co-sponsor i uh
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
basically in favor of the particular
 
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.470 align:start position:0%
basically in favor of the particular
action

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
however given the environment of uh
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
i don't mean no pun intended but with
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
the covid and all of our restrictions
 
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:03.820 align:start position:0%
and also the overlap with
 
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.350 align:start position:0%
and also the overlap with
[Music]

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
a currently functioning commission on on
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
chronic diseases i'm wondering if this
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
is something that we should perhaps
 
00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:16.149 align:start position:0%
is something that we should perhaps
consider

00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
doing for the time being um
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
i certainly uh it's aimed in the right
 
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.870 align:start position:0%
i certainly uh it's aimed in the right
direction

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm fully in favor of that but
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
re at least raise the question
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative woods i was
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
having a little bit of a difficulty
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
hearing you so are you recommending
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh going ahead with the recommendation
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
or not going ahead with the
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation and if you unmute
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
yourself again please that would be
 
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
yourself again please that would be
helpful

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i i will vote for it
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to raise the issue as
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
we go
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
forward and further discussion uh in uh
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
comes comes forward that we at least
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
consider the context in which we're
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
asking this to be done thank you very
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes can i raise a question uh i'm
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
going to take representative snow and
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to take representative
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
salloway and then i'm going to
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
look again so representative snow if you
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
wish to speak you may
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
yes i just had a question it was a
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
lengthy amendment
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh it was uh
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
1013h and that replaced the entire bill
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming that that's what we're
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
voting on not the original bill as it
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
was presented
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
what we're voting on basically is the
 
00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:36.830 align:start position:0%
what we're voting on basically is the
entire

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
concept and so
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're simply recommending
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
that the whole concept be
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
resubmitted next time or not and of
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
course as you know
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
we have no control over the members of
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
legislature it will be up to them
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
to determine whether this is resubmitted
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
and in what form
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
so if you would care to
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know say that you prefer the
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
um uh amended version we can certainly
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
we can certainly talk about that but the
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
ultimate recommendation is simply
 
00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:19.110 align:start position:0%
ultimate recommendation is simply
whether

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh whether further action is needed or
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
further action is not needed
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
recommended rather i would just ask
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative salloway if
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
i think it was him that introduced this
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment i
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
just know what his opinion was of that i
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
have no
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
quarrel with either one i guess it's up
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
to the representative that resubmits
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
to no but i just wondered what exactly
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
his opinion was
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
and representative salloway you're next
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
on my list so you may respond to that
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that representatives snow and
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
woods uh
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
bring their uh customary wisdom to this
 
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.710 align:start position:0%
bring their uh customary wisdom to this
committee

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and wonder if we might be able to
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
remand this
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the commission on environmental risk
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
and chronic disease
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
as an extension of their mandate and if
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
so how would we do that
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay first of all we have only two
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
options available to us
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
we write a report recommending further
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
action or we write a report
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
not recommending further action
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
if and that's further legislative action
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
i would suggest and i certainly
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
am subject to correction by anybody on
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
that if what is wanted is to refer
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
this matter to an existing commission
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we write a report that we
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
withdraw the recommendation for further
 
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
withdraw the recommendation for further
action

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
and write a report recommending no
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
further legislative action but include
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the language of the report
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
a suggestion that that particular
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
commission is the right place to discuss
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
it i mean that would be my suggestion as
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
to how to proceed but
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
members may have um a different thought
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
on that and i'll let representative
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
salloway respond first and then i'll
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
take representative woods
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would call for a vote of itl
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and then a report to remand it to
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
another commission we don't take a vote
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
of itl
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
we have only the option of recommending
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
for further action
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
or not recommending for further action
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
so um we don't have to do an itl vote
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
because that's not something that's
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
available to us today as a
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
as a way to proceed um representative
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
woods you wanted to comment
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you madam chair um that was
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't state it very well but
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what i would like to see
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
occur and i would refer to
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh because uh both uh representative
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
salloway and myself
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
are on that chronic disease commission
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
and i would just read that
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
articles 13 and 14 specifically state
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
that protocols be developed for
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
physician education
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
and guidelines for practice
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
so it specifically it includes
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
a to a significant degree overlap with
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh 1538 wishes to accomplish
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
and so i would uh you said it much
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
better than i and that's what i would
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
like to see accomplish
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay i see representative campion but
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
before she speaks i'm going to ask
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative salloway if
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
he would consider if it feels
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate to him withdrawing the
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislative
 
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.990 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislative
action

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
motion and if your second
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
also approves that perhaps we could have
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
the opposite motion
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
and consider accompanying it with a
 
00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
and consider accompanying it with a
report

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
that says that the legislature
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
believes or the committee believes if
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
the committee votes this way
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
that the further action that should be
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
taken should be taken
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
by the commission that's an excellent
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
suggestion madam chairman
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and i support that entirely
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay let me
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
take representative campion's comment
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
and then we'll work on that
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and it's really
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
just a procedural
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
comment i see that sai sharala's hand is
 
00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:45.990 align:start position:0%
comment i see that sai sharala's hand is
raised

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%

as an attendee from the department and
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
she may
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
have information that would help guide
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%

and you wish to say something yes um i'm
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
the bureau chief for the population
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
health and community services
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank representative
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
murphy and representative
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
woods for this legislation and uh
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned in our previous uh uh
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
process we did say that this would be
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
really suitable to sit under
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
the sb 85 the environmentally triggered
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
chronic illness
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
committee because in many ways it aligns
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
with their uh
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
prefer process and it provides that
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
and one thing we do want to also support
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire medical society is also
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
interested in providing this education
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
and um can support that and
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing that i do want to add
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
is senator shaheen has been
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
has proposed a specific legislation
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's focused on physician education
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
around pfas impacts
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
and that is uh some of that information
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
is being in the process and
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
is being legislated and that is also
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
similarly aligned with the same kind of
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh increased er physician education
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
around pfas impacts and other issues
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
and we want to thank the representatives
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
for your support on how to align those
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
committees together
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so much dr tyrella and so you
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%

00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
yes we would be that that that company
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
is specifically focused on the
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
environmentally environmentally
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
triggered chronic illnesses
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%

body to which we are referring this no
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry madam chair i meant what
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
when we on any of these bills yeah
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
action further action how do we who do
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
we refer that
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
to we are just stating
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
our opinion we're not actually saying it
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
to anybody we are stating our opinion as
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
that something ought to happen or ought
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
not to happen
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
but because we cannot as a committee
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
bind any member of the next legislature
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
anything we cannot tell anybody else
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
even if some of them are members
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
returning members who are
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
on this particular call so it
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
will be up to the next legislature to
 
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
will be up to the next legislature to
either

00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
introduce further legislation or not
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
introduce further legislation
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
and they can do that no matter what our
 
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.069 align:start position:0%
and they can do that no matter what our
recommendation

00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
is i understand that but what body
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
is this recommendation being made to
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
this specific
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation is being
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
made to the committee the name of which
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
representative woods is going to tell us
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
once more
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
well i misunderstood i think my question
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
is not specific and i think we're going
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
right direction i'm just saying on any
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
of these bills
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
when we refer for further action
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
who are we referring that further action
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
too and who takes the action
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
we can we can only suggest
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we can't mandate that anybody
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
at all do any other thing in
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
this particular case we are going to
 
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.829 align:start position:0%
this particular case we are going to
suggest

00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
to this commission that they take
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
further action on this
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
issue when we get to the next
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%

and we'll discuss that action and to
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
whom we refer it then
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
but this bill i'm going to
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes i actually have a question a point
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
of information that i need to sort out
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
are we those of us who made the motion i
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
presume are responsible for a report
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
then and if so
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
how do you want us to submit them and by
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
what time
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
um i want you to submit a report
 
00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:04.630 align:start position:0%
um i want you to submit a report
sometimes

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
say in the next 24 hours and i would
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
like you to email it to me
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and if there are
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
you know so we can work out um
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
whatever um my process will be to edit
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
it with you if
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
if i think there's any editing needed
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
and then i will forward it to ms dyer
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
for further
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
manipulation appropriate from the house
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
committee services as they normally do
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
and for inclusion in in a later calendar
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that's what will happen with that and
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the question
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
so that gets us back to the manufacturer
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical drug
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
take back program questions comments
 
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.710 align:start position:0%
take back program questions comments
thoughts

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro i see your hand i
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
um not remembering the testimony
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
um on this bill i'm unclear if this is a
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill that mandates that manufacturers
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
will create a take back program or if
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that allows manufacturers
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
of these medications to create a take
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
back program
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
my recollection and i am again subject
 
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:20.470 align:start position:0%
my recollection and i am again subject
to

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh correction by other members of the
 
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.589 align:start position:0%
uh correction by other members of the
committee

00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
is this would mandate a take back
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
program but leave to the manufacturers
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh the a pro
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
the onus of proposing how they're going
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
they have every opportunity right now i
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
believe to take back and there are
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary take
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
back programs in that you know various
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and other places have drug
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
um or at least disposal programs
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
so i believe they could certainly do it
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
on their own they don't
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
need our permission but i think that the
 
00:46:59.040 --> 00:46:59.750 align:start position:0%
need our permission but i think that the
intent

00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor was to
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
ensure that it happened there are
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
mandatory programs in a few states and
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
i think that that was the the thought uh
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative osborne i see your hand i
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
think it's fairly clear
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
if you look at um
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
line 18 it says therefore the general
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
court hereby
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
establishes a uniform drug take back
 
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.270 align:start position:0%
establishes a uniform drug take back
program

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
operated and funded by drug
 
00:47:29.119 --> 00:47:30.549 align:start position:0%
operated and funded by drug
manufacturers

00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
so it says we're going to do it that's
 
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
so it says we're going to do it that's
clear

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
finding that uh representative woods
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um one of the
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
issues that came up uh in hearings and i
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
think if i
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
remember correctly since this would have
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
not the oversight would be through hhs
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
and this would require three additional
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
people from what i understand
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
currently there's a hiring freeze
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
so there may be a difficulty and even if
 
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.710 align:start position:0%
so there may be a difficulty and even if
we

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
voted to go forward for it to to fail
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
therefore at the moment i would say
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
no further legislation okay
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative marsh you had
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
i thought thank you madam chairman i i
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that when we heard
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
about this bill when the state was in
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
considerably better financial shape than
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
it is at this point in time
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh we were told that we have an existing
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
drug take back program that it's working
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
very well
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that this new program would cost
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
considerably more than the existing
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
program to implement
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore i'm of the opinion that
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
this program is not something that we
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
should go forward with
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
and if it's appropriate i would make a
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
motion that no further legislation is
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
that that motion is certainly in order
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative marsh so
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative marsh has recommended no
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
um and i heard a second i thought
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion or
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative marsh did you want to
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
um representative shapiro
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
i have a question of clarification um
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
since the intent of this bill seems to
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
put the financial onus on the
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are making the money
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
um puts the financial onus on them to
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
where is how is this a more expensive
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
program for the state and is that
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
specifically to hire people within hhs
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
to oversee it
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative either woods or marsh
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
do you wish to respond to that
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection as well and i'm
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
at the disadvantage that my notes are
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
sitting in the drawer in the legislative
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
office building where
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
i can't read them but that's my
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
recollection yes yeah i have some note
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
i have some notes and then followed by
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am share my apologies for
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
bursting in
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
it's quite all right my my um
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
notes do in fact uh identify and i think
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
they're correct
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh three three additional ftes
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
a yes and the fiscal note
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh produced by dhhs did point that out
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
and said that the cost was going to be
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
um 106 000 in the first year going up to
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
230 000
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2023 because they do have
 
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.069 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2023 because they do have
responsibilities

00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
to collect data from wholesalers retail
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and so on and so forth
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
and uh by annual surveys and a number of
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
other features that did require the
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
hiring of new personnel madam chairman
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
stapleton's hand
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%

00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair in addition to
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
the three positions for
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh department of health and human
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
services there are survey costs biennial
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
surveys and these things can be
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
expensive they sound innocent enough but
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh what do you put into a survey twenty
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
five thousand thirty five
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
and i noticed the figures from um
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that uh or someplace
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
else that
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
if you put out a survey for ten thousand
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
people you might get a thousand back or
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
is it seven thousand out to get
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
one thousand back this is a lot of work
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
and uh i think they're just too much uh
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
for the short time that
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
that we have so um i i believe this
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
needs to go not
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
recommended and go on to the next
 
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.589 align:start position:0%
recommended and go on to the next
legislature

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
for their consideration and uh
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
well they may consider it in either case
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
but the recommendation that this we
 
00:53:47.359 --> 00:53:47.990 align:start position:0%
but the recommendation that this we
can't

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
take any further action in this
 
00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
take any further action in this

i just wanted to point out that it may
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
be read differently
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
and might one of folks might want to
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
read it as saying or not saying that
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
the department's supervisory costs would
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%

i think it depends on i don't think that
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's clear in the language
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
it does offer to pay for oversight of
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
administration but that particular
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
detail doesn't seem to be
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
noted here and i just wanted to point
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
that out thank you very much i
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.630 align:start position:0%
that out thank you very much i
appreciate

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
that uh are there other comments
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton go ahead
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
followed by representative osborne i
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
see that on page 14 at
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
um beginning at line
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
10 uh the department shall impose
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
any fees in excess of its actual
 
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.950 align:start position:0%
any fees in excess of its actual
administration

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
and it goes on to say they shall not
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
exceed 10
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the program's annual expenditures
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
so there's no idea what fees
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at here it's turning
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
it over to hhs to
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
determine the fee schedule as uh as well
 
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:04.789 align:start position:0%
determine the fee schedule as uh as well
as

00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
all of the other uh details and figures
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the cost and operation of this and i
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
think that's a little too open
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
um especially for uh the circumstances
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves in now with covid
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
and tight budget thank you very much
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative osborne
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh once again from the
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
document itself they do estimate
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
um how much those specialists those
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
three specialists will
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
cost and it ranges um
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
from do do do twenty three thousand
 
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.309 align:start position:0%
from do do do twenty three thousand
dollars

00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
forty seven thousand dollars and forty
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars are the
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%

okay i'm going to close the executive
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1610 fn
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
i am going to say that if you thought i
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
had trouble dealing with control issues
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
when we all sat
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
in our same seats the idea that the
 
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.150 align:start position:0%
in our same seats the idea that the
pictures

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
pictures
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
on my screen rearrange themselves
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
regularly and with no forewarning or
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
rationale that i can figure out it
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
drives me nuts but i will say that it's
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
very nice
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to just move a little cursor
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
and have the names appear
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
because that's very helpful to those of
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
us with aging minds so i'm going to open
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
the work session on house bill 1616 fn
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the age for minors visits to
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro yes
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
um i was originally opposed to this bill
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
given the documents from the researcher
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there are bills with
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
lower ages of consent for mental health
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
treatment in a variety of states
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
a variety of ages and a variety of
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
conditions put on that treatment
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
i am now open to this bill um
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
given that i think there are tremendous
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in the bill
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
as it is um written
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
so i would like to move to recommend
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
further legislation given
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill comes back in a different
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
form and i'll suggest
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
some of the things that i think need to
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
be done
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay let me see if i have a second to
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
that motion first i'll second that
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative snow has seconded um
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
so representative shapiro please go
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
ahead and
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
and state your your thoughts on it
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay so first um while none of us
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
want to see someone who is in
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
significant distress not be able to
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
obtain help because their parent is
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
emotionally unavailable or doesn't have
 
01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.710 align:start position:0%
emotionally unavailable or doesn't have
money

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
or is abusive in some way while we
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
all would not like to see a young person
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
slip through the cracks in that way
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think the sponsors of this bill
 
01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
i don't think the sponsors of this bill
initially

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
initially
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
established the need for this kind of
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
this kind of change there are ways that
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
can access treatment through a school
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
counselor through dcyf
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
so i think a better job needs to be done
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
about establishing the need
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think also a better job needs to be
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
done to establish why
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
also the bill does not refers to
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
temporary treatment but does nothing to
 
01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.069 align:start position:0%
temporary treatment but does nothing to
define

01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
define
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
temporary treatment if you look in the
 
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.470 align:start position:0%
temporary treatment if you look in the
documents

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
documents
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
from the researcher some of the other
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
states do define
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
temporary treatment in terms of a number
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
of sessions or a number of months
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
so i think that needs to be fixed the
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
question came up in our hearing about
 
01:04:53.359 --> 01:04:54.630 align:start position:0%
question came up in our hearing about
payment

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
if the parent is not to know about this
 
01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
if the parent is not to know about this
treatment

01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
which is a distinct possibility if a
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
young person can give consent on their
 
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.750 align:start position:0%
young person can give consent on their
own

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
who will pay if the insurance is not
 
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
who will pay if the insurance is not
accessible

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
a better job would have to be done to
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.190 align:start position:0%
a better job would have to be done to
describe

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
describe
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality of records since
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
generally speaking a parent or guardian
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
it would also have to be defined whether
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of treatment includes
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
prescription of psychotropic medications
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
by a medical doctor
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
as well as psychotherapy
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
and lastly on my list anyway
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
is that i think um the hospital
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
association or hospitals in general
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
would have to be brought into this
 
01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
would have to be brought into this
discussion

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
because um it's very dicey to have a 12
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
year old admitted to the hospital
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
without their parents
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're being admitted and
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
possibly where they are even so i think
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
um there would have to be discussions
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
with other stakeholders including
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals because hospitalization is
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned as part of mental health
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
treatment in this bill
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
okay so if i may summarize
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
what you are talking about
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
is that a further legislation
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
needs to have more considerations about
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
scope of the treatment the duration of
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
the treatment
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the treatment as well
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
as issues of confidentiality
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
and i i'm thinking about the
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
hospitalization part as being
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
part of the scope and range of treatment
 
01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
part of the scope and range of treatment
that

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
falls under the bill is that correct yes
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other thoughts uh
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
represent osborne followed by
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative woods followed by
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
when i first read this i was um in favor
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
of it but
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
i've researched some about all the
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
different states that have
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
all different plans sometimes you can
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
tell a parent sometimes you can't
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
and they do talk about cost uh i think
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is simply
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
too simple what we have here i
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
i think uh i agree with uh
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
that it it needs further study it's an
 
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:37.829 align:start position:0%
that it it needs further study it's an
important

01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
subject but it needs further study
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative woods
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
um i i can concur that this is an area
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
that this is a chance
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
to intervene at an age when we can
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
really make a difference
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
um and i think it it behooves us to
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
this carefully uh but not
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
step into a wormhole someplace
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
the other question um is the difficulty
 
01:08:08.799 --> 01:08:09.109 align:start position:0%
the other question um is the difficulty
of

01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
of and wasn't answered sufficiently
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
at least in my notes uh the issue of the
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
federal um statutes uh and significant
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
note was made that
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
conceivably violates federal law and
 
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
conceivably violates federal law and
might

01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
endanger some of the funds that are
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
currently in place
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
if it were to go through under its the
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
representatives snow you had a comment
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
yes i have i agree completely with
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
everything that everyone has said
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
i was contacted i think we all remember
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony we heard in
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee especially
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
from a young woman who was now at unh
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
who refused the ability to seek
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
treatment until she turned 18
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
was at the university and the remarkable
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
recovery she's made as a result of that
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
so there certainly is a reason why we
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
should proceed with this but this
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
bill needs a lot of work but one thing
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
the researchers said that the average
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
age for all the
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
states that have uh this kind of
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is 15.
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
so there's only two that i could see
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
that had 12 is an eight
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that seems very young that's seventh
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
grade that
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know there is a little bit of a
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of how early you
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
intervene in a family's
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
situation they do have dcyf for some
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
other problems but they don't
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
another is that whole issue of temporary
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
and that's defined all over the place
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh but we need to have a very definite
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
definition about what temporary means
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh confidentiality is a big problem
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
eobs will have to go out two parents
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
most of these children if they aren't on
 
01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.149 align:start position:0%
most of these children if they aren't on
medicaid

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
will have a be covered under their
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
parents insurance whatever that is
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
how the accountable care act or just
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
private insurance
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
and the eob goes to the parents so
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to know right away that
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
certain information and at this point
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
i've heard of
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners where they've been
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
threatened to be sued
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
if they didn't also send their notes so
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
i think we need to make very
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
sure that the protection of the exact
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
records is protected and this bill
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh to really cover that and i read the
 
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
uh to really cover that and i read the
medicaid

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
rules about this and it's very unclear
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
about exactly what's coming
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of medication this bill says
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
everything is covered but it doesn't
 
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
everything is covered but it doesn't
include

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of medication by a medical
 
01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.669 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of medication by a medical
doctor

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
right and i'm going to remind people
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we're not
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
writing the future legislation we're
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
just deciding whether
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
or not or shouldn't have future
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
legislation i was contacted by
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh the young woman who who uh submitted
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh her name is i think it's nicole
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative wine night yeah by night
 
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.669 align:start position:0%
representative wine night yeah by night
yes

01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
and she's the first thing she's very
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
very she's definitely going to resubmit
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
this bill no matter what we do but i did
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
urge her to
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
take a little time to work on it a
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
little bit i brought she asked me to
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
help her design it and i
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
did not accept that i said i thought she
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
had to go to legislative services
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
that they would be very helpful to her
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
but i did mention the issue of age and
 
01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
but i did mention the issue of age and
confidentiality

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
but another thing that i think is not
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
included in this bill is some provider
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
protection there's going to be lawsuits
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
by parents if they start seeing somebody
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't think a lot of the
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners or agencies are going to
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
want to be bothered
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
with a legal expense even though they're
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
on firm ground
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
of having parents suing in order to get
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
clinical notes
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh seeing as the law is pretty clear
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
that they have a right to medical
 
01:11:48.159 --> 01:11:48.790 align:start position:0%
that they have a right to medical
information

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
under children and i guess the final
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
thing is that um
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
well i get i think that's enough but i
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
completely agree with what everybody
 
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.390 align:start position:0%
completely agree with what everybody
said

01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
but i do think i would hope that somehow
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
we looked at a way
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
of in a meaningful way put a piece of
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislation in place
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
because suicide rates are going high the
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
kids are in
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
recognition of it and many times it's
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
not because of abusive or drug abusing
 
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.750 align:start position:0%
not because of abusive or drug abusing
parents

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
this particular girl it's because a lot
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
of people who are socially prominent
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is don't want their kids
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
to go into treatment
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
because of the possibility they'll
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
reflect badly in their family
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we need to avoid those barriers to
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
treatment for kids so
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
i'll shut up at this point but i do okay
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
representatives know you had something
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
else to say no i think
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro already made a
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
motion i don't want to repeat it so
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay the motion has been made the motion
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
is recommended for further action
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh i'm afraid
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
that i
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
i will not be able to vote in favor of
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
this motion i think
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
that it is intimately
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
related to the informed consent laws in
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and as we
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
know minors are not
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
legally able to give informed consent
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
unless they've been emancipated or dcyf
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
gets involved or
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
other legal matters happen which there
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
are mechanisms for those things to
 
01:13:14.239 --> 01:13:14.870 align:start position:0%
are mechanisms for those things to
happen

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
without informed consent uh
 
01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.229 align:start position:0%
without informed consent uh
practitioners

01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh even if we allow them to do treatment
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
their insurers
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
their malpractice insurers are not going
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
to permit them to do so or it would
 
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
to permit them to do so or it would
become

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
exorbitantly expensive for them to do so
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
even if we have a mechanism to pay for
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
it i think these are
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
are really huge complications with this
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
concept at this point in time
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
um i i don't see a way of fixing them so
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against further action
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative marsh
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative shapiro yes
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
i would just remind the committee that
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
um according to federal law
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
um people as young i think as 14
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
can already access family planning
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
and substance use disorder treatment
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
so um this would not be completely new
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
stapleton

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
stapleton
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i uh am opposed to the
 
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.070 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i uh am opposed to the
motion

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm troubled with uh lack of uh
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
for the exclusion of certain parent uh
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
parental uh consent and involvement
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's a dangerous protocol
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
there may be well there is
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
time and need for a special exception
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think the bill reflects the
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
precision necessary
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
to handle those things and instead it
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
broad brushes
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
and impugns the parental
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
rights and prerogatives to be involved
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
provide for payment and care and to be
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
part of the decision
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to oppose the motion thank
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh representative
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um shapiro and then representative snow
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
i would just like to say that i share
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton's concern
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
being a family therapist for most of my
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
most issues that young people face
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
are not going to be adequately addressed
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
without including their family
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i um also am concerned about
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
um excluding family excluding parents
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
um however i think there are some
 
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
um however i think there are some
situations

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
where the parents are unable to be
 
01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:46.950 align:start position:0%
where the parents are unable to be
helpful

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that in a future bill
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
um there could be some way to discern
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's really necessary for a
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
young person to give consent
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
and exclude parents i think that's very
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
tricky to do
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
but that would be my hope because i do
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
think excluding parents is a concern
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
yes i agree with what he said uh
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro said but
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
in some of the other states there's a
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
concept called mature
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
minor and they they somehow define that
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
and it puts the onus on the provider
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
that sees them
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
to determine that this seems to be a
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable and mature decision
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
being made by a minor and that the
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
therapist or the provider
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
document why they established that fact
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
and is determined to try
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
very hard to get the family involved
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
because many times with kids problems if
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
you don't include the family you're
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
not going to really get anywhere anyway
 
01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.630 align:start position:0%
not going to really get anywhere anyway
but

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
and they if they do make the
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
determination that the family should not
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
be involved
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
that they have very clear documentation
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
about why they made that decision
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
but that should be included in the law
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your comments
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no further representative
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
woods yes
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you manager um uh just a
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
slightly different perspective i realize
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
put forth my own concerns about the
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
federal issue
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
um but overall my
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
guiding principle is this is an age
 
01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.669 align:start position:0%
guiding principle is this is an age
group

01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
where we can really make a difference
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
and we have to look at it
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of deficiencies but
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes at least in my perspective
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
when i talk to my constituents
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes we bring forward legislation
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can develop a social dialogue
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
and gain critique but without that
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
public discussion and the awareness on
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the awareness for from legislators
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
on a continued basis we'll never have
 
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.350 align:start position:0%
on a continued basis we'll never have
discussion

01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
so i think given the age group that is
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
extremely vulnerable and has impact
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
in a multitude of dimensions farther in
 
01:18:10.239 --> 01:18:11.910 align:start position:0%
in a multitude of dimensions farther in
life

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's worthy of going forward if
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
nothing more than to keep the
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
the conversation going and raise all of
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
and even if we're not in the legislature
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
next time
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
those in the legislature will look at
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
the issue afresh
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
and probably raise exactly the same
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions and maybe have
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
better solutions thank you
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
this time i have 11 to 7. that would be
correct

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
because representative salloway has left
 
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.910 align:start position:0%
because representative salloway has left
us

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%

01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
first and then we will get to that uh
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie you had a yes
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
if my memory served me right by looking
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
at my notes
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the state and that in fact that they
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
are overburdened
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
presently in the job they're trying to
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
do now i thought that we heard testimony
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
for that fact and on that basis to give
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
them another
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
job if you will i think is not
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
wise legislature
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay other comments from the committee
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes right representative snow go ahead
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
according to my notes
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
we heard from the medical examiner's
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
office and others
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
that although we understand people
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about making sure everything
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
is done
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
to track down the reasons why an infant
 
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:13.990 align:start position:0%
to track down the reasons why an infant
dies

01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
dies
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
suddenly the medical examiner said they
 
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.189 align:start position:0%
suddenly the medical examiner said they
do

01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
all the tests that are presently
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
available and there's nothing else they
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances and she said
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
she felt the bill was not necessary
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
to do a thorough job in examining why
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
children die
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
suddenly and unexpectedly
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative snow
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
um yes indeed and i'm just looking back
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
at her letter
 
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh that she provided in testimony uh
 
01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:43.669 align:start position:0%
uh that she provided in testimony uh
that

01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
some of the the tests are are all the
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
tests that can be done are being done
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
and some of the
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
requests that were made are just not
 
01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.189 align:start position:0%
requests that were made are just not
feasible

01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay um are there other questions or
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh i will then take yes representative
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
hello this is rep camarada
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
welcome representative camerota and
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak to the
 
01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.270 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak to the
committee

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and let me just before
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
you start
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
remind you that this is not the time for
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
new testimony
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
this is just the time to argue whether
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
this should be recommended for further
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommended for
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
i understand thank you um
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that the
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
amendment 2020 0
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
656 was discussed
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
at the committee level i'm not sure if
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
that was the case
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
that amendment basically just
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
asks that the office of medical examiner
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
followed the federal law with regard to
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
reporting to bears
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
answer the question as to whether
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment was discussed i have a cop
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
i have a copy
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
of that let me just answer that on
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of the committee
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
we certainly had the submission and the
 
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.229 align:start position:0%
we certainly had the submission and the
committee

01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the committee members are aware of
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
that submission
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll take it into
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
account in in making our recommendation
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um and in respect
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
to that amendment i would like the
 
01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.270 align:start position:0%
to that amendment i would like the
committee

01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
to consider the importance of collecting
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
raw data so that we don't miss something
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
we don't yet understand
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
we do have an increase in sued cases so
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
with cases both nationally and new
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's not debatable
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
and if we collect data
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
we may see trends
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
and when you see trends then you
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
research further and that would be put
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
on theirs at a federal level
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
versus the new hampshire level but we
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to report it
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i asked the community
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
to vote in favor of
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
recommending further legislation because
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
it has merit
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
in order to bring new hampshire into
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal law
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for your
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
comments and your attendance today
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman i would like
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
to say that i agree with representative
 
01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:50.629 align:start position:0%
to say that i agree with representative
camarada

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
camarada
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh i think that the minority amendment
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
which would simply require
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the reporting to the veer system be
 
01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:58.709 align:start position:0%
that the reporting to the veer system be
done

01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and it's probably even
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
more appropriate now
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
when we are considering fast tracking uh
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
certain vaccinations which may be
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
enrolled to the public
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
with perhaps less than adequate testing
 
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
with perhaps less than adequate testing
uh

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think that that to compromise the
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine monitoring system
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh when children could conceivably die
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
from side effects would not be wise
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
and and therefore i agree that further
 
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.390 align:start position:0%
and and therefore i agree that further
legislation

01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
not to the extent of the original bill
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
but to the extent of the minority
 
01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
but to the extent of the minority
amendment

01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh would be appropriate thank you very
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
much i'm just going to state
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
my own personal deeply held conviction
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
on this bill that i think that
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
based on what we have heard
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
that the medical examiner is
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
doing what uh is required to be done
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
and really is following
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
is is doing everything that
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
can be done both to bring a resolution
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
to a parent who is grieving the loss of
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
a child
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
which is a terrible thing and also
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
to increase the availability of
 
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.270 align:start position:0%
to increase the availability of
scientific

01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge so my own
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
feeling on the matter is that it should
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
not be recommended for further
 
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.629 align:start position:0%
not be recommended for further
legislation

01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh but that's just um i'm speaking from
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
a personal level there
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
rather than anything else uh i see
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative knurk has his hand up
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair uh one
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
of the points made by the chief medical
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
examiner in her
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh testimony both oral and written is
 
01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:43.430 align:start position:0%
uh testimony both oral and written is
that

01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of 22 states that
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
participate in the suid
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the sdy which is sudden death and
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
the young
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh case registry and the advantage of
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
that you're not just getting the
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
inference you're getting infants and
 
01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.229 align:start position:0%
inference you're getting infants and
young

01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
young
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the idea in this is you're taking a
 
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.430 align:start position:0%
and the idea in this is you're taking a
problem

01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
death you're then going to look at all
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
the factors that may be involved the
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
various bias is it because it says
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
you had a vaccine and there was a
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
concern so you're already
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
kind of coloring the data by bringing it
 
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:14.229 align:start position:0%
kind of coloring the data by bringing it
in

01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
for a and for an intervention that was
 
01:31:16.719 --> 01:31:17.350 align:start position:0%
for a and for an intervention that was
done

01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
and gathering data on that rather than
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
looking at an outcome which is
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
death and looking at potentially all the
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
causes that may be there
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
and including a broader age group that
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
covers the age of vaccination
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
beyond just infants so that is a program
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
which is already
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
if you see a trend that um you know
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have a number of kids who are dying
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
and we find out that there is a common
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
factor of vaccines in excess
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
of other factors that would then open up
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
a door
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
for further investigation and i think is
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
a parallel process to bears but a
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
cleaner way to gather up the scientific
 
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.790 align:start position:0%
cleaner way to gather up the scientific
data

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative knark uh do we
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
have a motion at this point
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
oh i raised my hand oh i'm sorry
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
representative frieda
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
i beg your pardon go ahead and go ahead
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so much i just have had a lot
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
of communication with people
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
about this bill and much of it has to do
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
with the connection
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
to vaccines and what they're asking
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
is is that documented in any way that
 
01:32:24.159 --> 01:32:25.510 align:start position:0%
is is that documented in any way that
the

01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
death of the child the child had been
 
01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.270 align:start position:0%
death of the child the child had been
vaccinated

01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the recent past and so i don't know
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
whether that is out of what the
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
medical examiner has in his report now
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
or is this going to be something that
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
this group is asking to have
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
added to my understanding
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
is that the uh scheduled of vaccines
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
that a child
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
who has this form of death
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
the schedule of vaccines is part of a
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
child's medical records
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
that the medical examiner will look on
 
01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:01.270 align:start position:0%
that the medical examiner will look on
look

01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
at in any case of child death so
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
that is definitely part of what they are
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that that was what the the
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
medical examiner testified to
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it would be part of
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
the examination
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh under any circumstances and it would
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
be part of the record
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh as to what vaccines the child had
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
received and when
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative snow has his hand up as
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have representative snow
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
and then i believe representative nelson
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
also wishes to speak
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
representatives now yes i i do have a
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
note here on
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
on that i wrote down on the amendment
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
when it was passed out to us
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
and the medical aim that did say that in
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
all cases of a
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
sudden infant death syndrome if they've
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
had vaccinations that the
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
the test is done and the report is made
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the ba
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh what is it uh vex uh
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine address events reporting system
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
so she's already doing that
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we would need this in
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
order to compel her to do it
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing it as an automatic product
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
when they do that exam
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative snow and
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative nelson you wanted to
 
01:34:20.239 --> 01:34:21.030 align:start position:0%
representative nelson you wanted to
comment

01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes matter chairman i more have a
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
question i'm
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
wondering if anybody counts a child
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
pre-born child that
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
may be aborted or uh
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
die before their births anybody count
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
that as to possibly
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh does that fit in counting the number
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
of people that might have a
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh problem with a vaccine or something
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
do they include kids
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
pre-born they wouldn't have had a
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine yet
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
we it's not the only person who might
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
have had a vaccine in that case would
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
have been the
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
mother rather than the fetus um
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
but this bill does not deal with that so
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative nelson you wanted to
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
comment further yeah we're so interested
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
in getting this information which i do
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
think we should
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
it should be i would think you would
 
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.149 align:start position:0%
it should be i would think you would
somehow

01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh pre-born child and fetus that you
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
would want to know if the mother had a
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh some kind of shot a couple weeks
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
before and all of a sudden leave the
 
01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:20.629 align:start position:0%
before and all of a sudden leave the
baby

01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
baby
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
still born thank you representative
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
um ms dyer were you trying that's my
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
apologies you have several attendees
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%

have their hands up i'm not sure if you
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
want to entertain them but um

to all of them
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
that this is the time for the um
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee to be making their discussions
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%

01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
testimony so
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to recognize representative
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
campion and then representative tyshurst
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
and then representative knerk and then i
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%

further uh representative
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
champion thank you madam chair i would
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
just like
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
to reinforce representative connerk's
 
01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:20.629 align:start position:0%
to reinforce representative connerk's
comment

01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
about the order in which one might ask
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
the question about the effect of a virus
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry a vaccine
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
on death not the virus
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
got it on the brain right now and that
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
is that if we go
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
looking for a particular cause and
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
collect data about the cause
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
before we understand the outcome that
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
the answer will be
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for we will def we
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
will find
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
a connection between vaccines and sudden
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
unexpected infant death if we start
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
as representative kenork suggested with
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
a child has died which is a tragic
 
01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.310 align:start position:0%
a child has died which is a tragic
circumstance

01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
and then seek to understand whether
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is anything that has
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
occurred either in the immediate
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
past or over some time to affect that
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
child's health
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
and survivability we'll have a better
 
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.030 align:start position:0%
and survivability we'll have a better
understanding

01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
from a scientific perspective about
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not there exists a
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
relationship between vaccines and or
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
any other either environmental or
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
other cause so i will i will vote
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
not to recommend i would vote against
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
recommending further legislation thank
 
01:37:37.679 --> 01:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
recommending further legislation thank
you

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
you recommend representative campion
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i guess for me
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
um this is a a terribly difficult
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
subject but i feel that
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
um whether we vote to recommend or don't
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
vote to recommend is kind of neither
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
here nor there because
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is likely to come up i'm
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably going to vote against
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
further legislation just because i think
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
um start fresh i think this bill had
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
some problems and may have been overly
 
01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.510 align:start position:0%
some problems and may have been overly
complicated

01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative um
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative knurk yes i
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that we should not be
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
hearing uh testimony again but if
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
doctor sai sharala is in the audience
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
and asking to comment
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%

is one of the uh 22 states that has the
 
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:37.990 align:start position:0%
is one of the uh 22 states that has the
suit

01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
suit
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
the sudden unexplained infant death
 
01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.669 align:start position:0%
the sudden unexplained infant death
registry

01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
so we actually follow every suit that in
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
and we have a suite committee that
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
actually looks at
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
all of these cases they review
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and try to understand what are the con
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
what's what is happening
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
for this child to have that kind of
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
situation so they look at the medical
 
01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:01.669 align:start position:0%
situation so they look at the medical
history

01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
they understand the physical uh any kind
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
of issues that under
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
whether it is the sleep environment are
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
there some other factors that are
 
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.149 align:start position:0%
there some other factors that are
involved

01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
so they do a very in-depth kind of
 
01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:13.270 align:start position:0%
so they do a very in-depth kind of
review

01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the case so they try to understand
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then they that they use that
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
information to point out
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
what a public health campaigns or more
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
medical provider education
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
or even kind of provide more services to
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
the families who might need them
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
including like home visiting uh parent
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
education or unsafe sleeps
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
a safe sleep kind of those kind of
 
01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.149 align:start position:0%
a safe sleep kind of those kind of
things

01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
those are some of the things that are
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
done and has a part of review they also
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
ask questions that on vaccine history
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
whether what kind of vaccination that
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
the child had or the infant had before
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh before that event so those are some
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that are taken uh
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
taken into account and actually part of
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
that also
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
is they do follow um the families
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
basically for a great
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
grievance grief process and provide
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
resources to the families about what
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
kind of things that they can do
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
and they are the resources that they can
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
access to
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
so if there are any other follow-up
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions i would be ha
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
i would um i can answer any of those
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions but i also
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
have dr jenny duval from office of chief
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
medical examiner is also on the call
 
01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.990 align:start position:0%
medical examiner is also on the call

01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
again we're trying very hard not to take
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
new testimony
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
does the committee want to hear for dr
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%

pardon me madam chair but could i also
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh dr paul are you with us i think so
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can hear you and if
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
you would state your name and spell your
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
name for the benefit of the clerk
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh jenny j e n n i e
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
duval d u v a l okay
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much welcome and um
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
your uh clarifications
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i i was just making myself available
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
questions um i think that uh
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
what dr representative kenner and
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative campion said is
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
is very true if we're talking about this
 
01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.870 align:start position:0%
is very true if we're talking about this
amendment

01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
which i haven't seen the text of but it
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would require us to
 
01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.669 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would require us to
report

01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
all suid deaths to the vaccine adverse
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
event reporting system
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
and as as has already been mentioned i
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
think that would
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
um muddy the data if if every
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
medical examiner office did that then
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
all sewage would be
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
would be you vaccine and i think that
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
would be a disservice
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
and um it would not help us in the least
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
trying to find an explanation for these
 
01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.350 align:start position:0%
trying to find an explanation for these
deaths

01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much dr duvall um
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative woods uh just to expand
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
on that a moment oh i think what she's
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
and i uh wish our other representative
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
who's an epidemiologist that left us but
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's by the the structure of that data
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
collection is by definition
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
conformational what's called
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
conformational bias
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh and as a consequence uh the data is
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
not just muddied but in essence is valid
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you doc representative woods
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
um any further questions for dr duval
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
doctor mike excuse me go ahead
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding was during the
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony in the amendment
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
that you already did report it to the
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine thing
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
if there was any reason to believe that
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
this sudden infant death
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
was a result of a back seat not
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
reporting every single
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh sudden infant death thing but if
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
if it is evident that it is from some
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
procedure that you're doing you already
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
report that is that not correct uh
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative snow i think there's a
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
confusion here about the different
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
bodies to which things may be reported
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
and if dr duvall
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
could clarify for us
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
what to whom she reports and under which
 
01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.430 align:start position:0%
what to whom she reports and under which
circumstances

01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful i yes so
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
we would certainly report to theirs
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
the va ers any death that we suspected
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
was caused by a vaccine
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
but as i understand it this amendment
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
is requiring us to report
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
any death temporally associated with
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine administration
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and that would i don't think would
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
be appropriate
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
um because the data is becomes
 
01:45:08.639 --> 01:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
um because the data is becomes
meaningless

01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
meaningless
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know temporal relationship is does
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
not mean cause
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for dr
 
01:45:22.719 --> 01:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for dr
duvall

01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
duvall
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh i
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
would entertain perhaps emotional at
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
i can't someone make a motion
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
who's speaking please representative
 
01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.550 align:start position:0%
who's speaking please representative
snow

01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
snow
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative snow go ahead i make a
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
motion that
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh no further action be taken on this
 
01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:53.830 align:start position:0%
uh no further action be taken on this
bill

01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
on this bill 16 16
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative snow has moved no further
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
action than who was the second
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative woods um
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
is there further comments we have
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
certainly heard a great deal of comment
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
from people both for and against
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
that particular emotion
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
i don't see any further discussion
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
so the motion is a recommendation of no
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
further action
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh no further legislation uh
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
and when she is ready on house bill 1666
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
and when she's ready the clerk may call

01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
additional recommendation but the other

sponsors do not have to write a note
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has to write a brief report
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%

01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
the person who made the motion is the
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
person who writes the report
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
and so i will be glad to help out with
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
that in any way i can
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
but we need to get them done relatively
 
01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:11.350 align:start position:0%
but we need to get them done relatively
quickly

01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%

zooms that we just end and all vanish
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%

ending meetings there's no
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
