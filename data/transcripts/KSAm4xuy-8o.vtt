here all right and seeing that we have a
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
quorum uh we'll go ahead and get started
 
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
let me just refresh everyone's memory
 
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
what we're doing this morning uh as you
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
recall two weeks ago we looked at uh HB
 
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
542 and HP 744 in detail uh there were a
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that were brought up
 
00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
which required amendments and uh so
 
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie's done a lot of
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
work to uh
 
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
amend those bills and so we thought that
 
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
it would be worthwhile for us to take a
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
hard look at those amendments and uh see
 
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
where those bills could go from there
 
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
and so I open I opened the session on HP
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
542 uh this
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
is based on a resource recess that we
 
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
did two weeks ago and representative
 
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
McKenzie if you could go through sort of
 
00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 align:start position:0%
a recap of where we were at and then
 
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
what your Amendment does I'd appreciate
 
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
that all right sure enough Mr
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
chairman so the original uh legislation
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh had six additional steps at the top
 
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
scale uh we have uh this particular
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation the amendment will
 
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
if the member could suspend and you're
 
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
you're in testimony now so because we're
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
in a hearing so if you can uh sit at the
 
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
the witness I think that'd be uh more
 
00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman my name is Mark
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I am a representative from
 
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 40 in
 
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm here this morning to
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
introduce uh the amendment
 
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
to uh HB
 
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
542 uh the amendment uh as drafted is
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
differs from the original um bill in the
 
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
sense that it takes back uh six of the
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh 12 steps that were
 
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
proposed the current schedule will go up
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
52,000 uh would in uh at the rate of
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
$535 will be the top of the scale uh
 
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
$427 now the uh initial uh
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and I think I shared with
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
you the amendment fiscal impact of the
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the the original uh the
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh was more was a reach
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
and very difficult I think to uh uh
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
given there would be no tax increase on
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
the other side it would be a difficult
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh thing to achieve uh but I think what
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
we've done is to strike a balance and I
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
was kind of hoping the UI people would
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
be here this morning but what it does is
 
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
strike a
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
balance so the proposed uh Amendment uh
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
stays within the lines in the sense that
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
it uh does not break the fund uh and
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
there is a I don't know if everybody has
 
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
this in front of them but you kind of
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
get into weeds with this let me let me
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
go through
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
it the the system uh tests uh when they
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
do a stress test on the system they do
 
00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
it by looking at what's known as a mild
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
recession uh and a major
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
recession and the original Amendment uh
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
put too much stress on that on the
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
system and so if you look under the
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
forecast for the mile
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
recession uh what that has done is to
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
scale back
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh so that under a mile recession the
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
fund would would finish at 237 million
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the current uh balance in
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
the fund is I think about
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
$380 or $85 million right
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
now uh what you don't want to do when
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
you look at passing any kind of benefit
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
increases you don't want to get to the
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
point where the system is in a negative
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
draw because at that point you have to
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
go to the federal governments you have
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
to uh draw money down uh and borrow
 
00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
money actually from the federal
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
government so this amendment avoids that
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh even in the times of U uh impact of a
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
major recession now this doesn't mean
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen but the way that
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
they approach the funding of the bill
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
they they do it this way so that you
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
understand that what could potentially
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
happen so even um even under that uh the
 
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
impact of a major recession the fund
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
would still be in a position where they
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
would would not have to borrow uh so it
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
would finish I think at in
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
2026 at 200 uh 42 million if the major
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
recession uh were to
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
occur so what you have here is uh is an
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
amendment which I I think presents an
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to increase the unemployment
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
benefits and keep in mind the employers
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
are at a 30-year low in terms of that
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
tax rate the current tax rate is about
 
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
$85 a uh uh an employee for unemployment
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
they're at the all-time low well a
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
30-year low the fund is at a high it's
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
never really been this High uh 400
 
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
million would be the top end but they
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
have as a result of it being over $350
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
million they have taken advantage of
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
each and every uh reduction
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh that is that is in the law
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
so the way it works is that
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
250 I think it's
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
275 so every time that fund goes up the
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
the uh tax rate goes down so at this
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
point they have reached that level where
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
the tax rate is the lowest it's going to
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
be so this particular Amendment would
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
have no impact on that that uh that
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
level now
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
what this in expanding what's going on
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
with the system currently is that when
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
you and this has been going on for 20
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
years because there has been no increase
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
in the unemployment rate in 20 years so
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
what what happens right now is that
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
people making more than $41,500
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh they max out so the maximum benefit
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
people can receive is
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
$427 under the current
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
system now with this um and just give me
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
a minute so I can uh make sure I get
 
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.110 align:start position:0%
a minute so I can uh make sure I get
this

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
right um there will be an increase so
 
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh the maximum weekly benefit uh am M
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire during Kia was count 23
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
ATT there were 11,400 individuals paid
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
UI benefits and 6,500 of them or 58%
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
qualified or were paid to 427
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh the average base period however for
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
the claimants uh qualifying for 427 in
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
86,5 so the base so that's important to
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
note because what happens as you get up
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
415 when you start to go Beyond 415 the
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
replacement ratio goes down and so those
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
people who are making more than
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
415 uh uh and you in the uh uh UI people
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
presented this to us uh it represents
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
26% wage replacement
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
rate and uh that's that's the problem
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
with not increasing the upper level of
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
it now
 
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh there were other uh there were other
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
is things that they talked about when
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
they went into 2024 but the trend is
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
continues to be basically the same
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
um except that the wages get higher each
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
year so the more they go up the the less
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
that that deteriorate the more that
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
deteriorates that replacement rate now
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
nationally what you try to shoot for is
 
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the 50 some OD percent
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
range and that happens to be the case as
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
you come from the bottom of the scale
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
and you go up until you hit that that
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
415 that's where it really shoots down
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
so you got you basically have this uh 50
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's 53 to
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
56% replacement rate uh towards the
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
middle and in the top end of the 415 but
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
once you hit once you go over that
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
threshold it really starts to
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
deteriorate so the question it's a
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
question of um of equity I think in
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
terms of you know do people can we
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
increase that so that the replacement
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
rate is increased uh and is that given
 
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
that the lower end of scale is getting
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
it getting more money uh it doesn't make
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
sense to to increase the top end of that
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
scale as
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
well so that essentially is is the the
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
nature of the of this legislation and
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
essentially that's what it does now
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario you could end up
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
with uh tax increases and things like
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
that that's why they test this for mild
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
and and severe recessions but currently
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh as I understand it there will be no
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh impact on the uh contribution rate uh
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
if this legislation is is passed as I
 
00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
understand it from UI because the rates
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
have already been set all of the
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
discounts are in
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
place so that's uh that's essentially
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and representative a
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
thank you U Mr chairman thank you
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie for being here
 
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.150 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie for being here
um

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
did Mr lers means test this for
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
utilization like a higher rate means
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
they're going to be on unemployment
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
longer oh wonderful oh good I will defer
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
well let me just say that and I'm sure
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like to hear from him more than
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
me um there is there is some evidence uh
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
I believe in some testimony that we
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
heard that when the rate went up for Co
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
there was some uh some increase in in
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks as I understand that
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
the average week a number of weeks that
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
people are unemployment is about 12
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
weeks up slightly from the last time I
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
it but let me say let me say and those
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
people that ever been unemployed
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
understand this uh that the unemployment
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
system there is no sitting around on the
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
when you're on
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment there is no you know I'm
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
just going to watch TV and stay home
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
there is a very strict uh rigid system
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
that requires you to be available and
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
looking for work all the time so you you
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
and if you don't do that you don't file
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
with the with the Department Employment
 
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
Security then you're not going to get
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
your benefits you be denied so it's a
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
very important thing to understand and
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
let me also say that uh while the UI
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
benefits are one component of uh of the
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
support system that surrounds a
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
unemployed worker
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
there are all of these other things that
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
are taking place when somebody's on
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
Unemployment uh you have all the
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
services that are available to you
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
training and resume writing and job
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
seeking and and polishing up all of the
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
things that uh that you need and
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
understand that people are not quitting
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
you can't quitting get on unemployment
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
you have to be let go uh and many times
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly so is 12 weeks reasonable I
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
don't know but I I don't think think
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
that the evidence would show that
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
increasing the UI benefits going to keep
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
people on longer this is not a u so I I
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
mean and Lees um commissioner Lees can
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
could are there any other questions
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
representative K thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
question uh while I I might have thought
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
that someone making 42,000 or 2,000
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
would be in a better place to prepare
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
and and be ready for such an impact I I
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe have you know 30% of their
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
salary you know set aside I realize that
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
inflation has taken a a big b out of
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
that and it takes a lot more to make
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
your monthly obligations and it's also
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
true that people tend to live maybe a
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
little bit closer to what they can
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
actually afford rather than you know
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
comfortably uh so does this is it also
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
is it also true that there are more High
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
earners coming into the state I think I
 
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
read this from Mr gly that people are
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
generally making you know in the in the
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
80s it's an average or median wage and
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
that this is the people that you're
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
trying to assist uh so that they don't
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh fall short on their mortgage payments
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature well the the
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
according to the uh analysis that was
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
done by the employment security uh 427
 
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:25.829 align:start position:0%
done by the employment security uh 427
in

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
2320 uh the base period for that was 8
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
6,359 was the base period and because of
 
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.350 align:start position:0%
6,359 was the base period and because of
that

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
427 against the 86 359 the base the wage
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
replacement was
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
26% so if you look at the economic data
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest that that somewhere around
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
58,000 is what somebody needs to live in
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire family needs you pay
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
insurance you pay all car and all that
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so this gets us somewhat
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
closer uh to uh to to that number but
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
there are high earners coming into the
 
00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
state uh for sure
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
and you know people are going to get
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
people can walk into work we hear this
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
all the time and all of a sudden they
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
they have no job and you is 12 weeks uh
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
too much uh they're entitled to 26 and
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
very PE few people ever get there most
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
people but people are back to work and I
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
think the system does a good job and
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
getting him back to work and you know
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
just think as you as you go through this
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh the impact on people's family when
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
you all of a sudden you you come in on
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
Monday and you go home on Tuesday and
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's it don't come
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
back that has a big impact on on the
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
stability of the family uh the stress
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
that causes is enormous and this I hope
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh I can appeal to you to increase the
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
rate to help put that stress and and
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
discomfort that occurs whenever anybody
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
is suddenly laid off thank you
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions so I did have a
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
clarification so in in in your testimony
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
just now I thought you said that there's
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
no impact on the employer in terms of
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
higher rates but when I look at the
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
analysis it says that
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
employers that taxes owed by employers
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
during 2027 will increase by 22.5
 
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.549 align:start position:0%
during 2027 will increase by 22.5
million

00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
so can you clarify that please well I if
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
you would mind I defer to uh we can
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
defer that yeah fine minus any is at the
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
rate itself um because it's already set
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
that the rate itself will not be
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
impacted the the um the UI rate that
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
they have that's my understanding
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
because of where because every every one
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the discounts has already been
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
applied but I I think that um
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
clarification could be made all right
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions sir thank
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
you for the work on the amend
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
explanation and Mr labers if you have a
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
minute and if you could both fill out
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
pin cards so that we're straight on
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I appreciate that yeah I'm
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
sorry for being a few minutes late
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
to um do the members have a copy I think
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
I started around here copy of the
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
analysis of the amendment
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so uh for the record Richard
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
labers Deputy Commissioner New Hampshire
 
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.430 align:start position:0%
labers Deputy Commissioner New Hampshire
employment

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
security um so the amendment to House
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 542 that representative McKenzie
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
has introduced um in the analysis that
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
the department provided you can see what
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
he's what he's uh um um suggesting now
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
to do is rather than 12 additional tiers
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
it would be six additional tiers so the
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
maximum uh benefit uh would be uh under
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
his proposal
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
um would be
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
$535 a week for someone that had earned
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
at least $52,000 in their four quarter
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
base period compared to the current
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
maximum of
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
427 uh which someone who earns $41,500
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
in their base period uh would need to
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
earn um his proposed new maximum
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
maintains the same wage replacement rate
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
as in the current schedule of Ben
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
benefits um it's
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
53.5% wage replacement meaning it's
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
replacing just over half of the dollars
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
you earned an employment with your
 
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.669 align:start position:0%
you earned an employment with your
unemployment

00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
benefit um I did excuse me I did um
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
update the analysis to show that in the
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
actual filers what their wage
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
replacement rate has been so in
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
2024 um the individuals that qualified
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
$427 their average base period earnings
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
was just over
 
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.390 align:start position:0%
was just over
$88,500

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
$88,500
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
so they had a an actual wage replacement
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
rate of about
 
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
25% uh when we look at the average
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
private sector worker right now in New
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um when I look at the the data
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
that we have available is for the first
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
half of 2024 this is from the
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
administrative records filed by
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
employers U this the this bill um at the
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
maximum weekly benefit amount of 535
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
would be a wage replacement rate of
 
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.870 align:start position:0%
would be a wage replacement rate of
about

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
35% to that average private sector
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
worker uh with regard to so that's the
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
impact on the individual filers and I
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
did include information showing how many
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
individuals from 2020 before would have
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in their weekly benefit
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
if this bill uh were in effect um
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
shifting gears for the impact on
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
employers uh we did update that analysis
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
so you can see uh what the impact would
 
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
be under current economic conditions as
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
well as applying this to the model that
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
mimicked a mild recession as well as a
 
00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
model that mimicked a severe um U or
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
major recession I believe is how we
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
refer to it in the current economic
 
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
conditions there would not be any impact
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
to the fund balance reductions or the
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
discounts that employers have on their
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
earned tax rate right now employers get
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
a 1% reduction to their rate because the
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
fund balance uh exceeds $350
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
million that that is what is currently
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
forecast without any changes the fund
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
will continue to maintain a balance
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
north of
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
350 but will not hit the $400 million
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
threshold which would trigger the
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
maximum fund balance reduction or
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
discount of
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
1.5% so right now without any changes to
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
the benefit schedule we are not
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
forecasting employers to get to that 1
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
and a half% reduction we're forecasting
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
the 1% reduction The Proposal from
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie as amended would
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
not impact the fund performance in terms
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
of that fund balance reduction that
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
employers um are forecasted to
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
experience again that's with current
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
economic conditions no economic
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
downturn um when we looked at the um
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
mild and the major recessionary
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
scenarios again a lot of assumptions
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
that are made here um The Economist do
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh try to uh caveat these by reminding
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
me that the further you get out from
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
your current date the less um uh
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
confidence they have in the accuracy um
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
of those forecasts but when you look at
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
both recessionary scenarios The Proposal
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
from representative McKenzie in his
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment would cause an impact on
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
employers where they would lose the
 
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
forecasted fund balance reduction a
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
quarter sooner than they would without
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
making these changes to the benefit
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
schedule uh so you're looking out uh to
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
the first quarter of 2027 in order for
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
that uh forecasted impact to hit uh but
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
without any change in those recessionary
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios we would forecast employers to
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
still have a half Point reduction in the
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
first quarter of
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
27 with the ended benefit schedule from
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie we forecast that
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
the employers would not have that half
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
Point fund balance reduction in the
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
first quarter of 27 uh so it's with the
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
impact of not having that half Point
 
00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
reduction in the first quarter of 27
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
that causes a forecasted increase in
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
taxes paid for that quarter of just
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
under $23 million so to recap that
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
current economic conditions we do not
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
forecast this proposal to have any
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
impact on the fund balance reductions in
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
both recessionary forecasts we do impact
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
do forecast there to be an impact on
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
Employers in the tax rate at which
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be paying to support
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program and I can stop
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
right there Mr chairman and if there are
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
any questions I can take them now thank
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
you for the explanation are there any
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Flanigan thank
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr Shar it's good to see you again
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
Mr L uh and thank you for your testimony
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of bented around that the
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
longer you have the ability to
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
collect it's a propensity to stay
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
unemployed is there any studies out
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
there or is there any research that you
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
know of that can say that if if the
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
duration longer that tend people tend to
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
be on unemployment
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
longer yes so it's it's a good question
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
um what I can tell you is so with this
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
proposal is simply proposing to increase
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
the amount and not the increase the
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
duration for which you can file um when
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
we look at our current duration New
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does quite well um both um
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
when we look at average duration of
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
being uh just over 12 weeks and also our
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rate being uh I believe we
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
right around 16% exhaustion um so right
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
now you're eligible for up to 26 weeks
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay average duration is just over 12 it
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
has been increasing slightly since the
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of 23 I had noted in previous
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
testimony I will say and we get this
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
data monthly I will say that the
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
December to January um average duration
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
didn't change um it actually stayed
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
right where it was um that could be a a
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
sign of a leveling off I don't know um
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
but right now you just over 12 weeks
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
despite having eligibility for 26 so
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
people are going back to work quickly
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
they're going back to work sooner than
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
most um individuals filing for
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
unemployment in other states uh our
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
average duration is the 11th lowest in
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
the country and our exhaustion rate of
 
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.669 align:start position:0%
the country and our exhaustion rate of
uh

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
15% um is uh the second lowest in the
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
Northeast and second lowest EX austion
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
rate in the country Vermont's at
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
15% um I will point out states that do
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
have fewer weeks and 26 weeks is the the
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
dominant um number of weeks available in
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment programs um in States
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
across the country US Department of
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
Labor you you can adjust your weeks that
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
you have available they are not going to
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
cry foul and suggest that that is
 
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
somehow uh a violation of Conformity or
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
compliance with Federal standards U but
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
states that do have few fewer weeks uh
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
they tend to have very high exhaustion
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
rates uh so um Florida being one of them
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
I believe Florida has 13 weeks available
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
um more than half of their filers
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
exhaust the weeks that they have
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
available um so I I
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
think in my in my opinion and my
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
experience with the Department is having
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
more weeks available than you use so
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
right now we're only using less than
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
half of what is available but having
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
those available so you have the
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility to adjust with economic
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
conditions and the needs of your
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce that um could find themselves
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
needing to file for unemployment right
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
now um there are uh the the jobs that
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
are available continue to be uh fairly
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
plentiful um so your ability to find new
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
Employments um is definitely a weight on
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
the on the side of the worker if we were
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
to get into to a different uh set of
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
economic conditions jobs are more
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to find um and your duration
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
goes up uh I think most people would be
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
um pleased that they had the
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility with the current structure
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
of the program to um provide some level
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
of wage replacement for people in those
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh situations where you have fewer jobs
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
available and it's harder to find
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
employment um I know um certainly the
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
the pandemic was an outlier um in terms
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
of the ability to return to work uh but
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
the ability to continue to file and have
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
some wage replacement was certainly um a
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
godsend for a lot of individuals a lot
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
of workers in the state during that
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
period and and was certainly um um
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
helpful for families and individuals
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession as well
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you and for followup
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
representative FL thank you uh very
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
brief although I'm not sure if it can be
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
answered briefly but um if we do in fact
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
make this change that is allow for a
 
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.509 align:start position:0%
make this change that is allow for a
higher

00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
income um and all of a sudden we have
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
some catastrophic economic events it's
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
very unlikely that we can go back isn't
 
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.549 align:start position:0%
very unlikely that we can go back isn't
that

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
true um in terms of uh reducing the
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
um it would be highly unlikely to reduce
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
the weekly benefit uh amounts at that
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
point because um I can tell you which
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
direction inflation is going to continue
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.350 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much thank you Mr
represent

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
pass did you have
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
kale thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
lers uh so if if this amendment were to
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
pass I understand we' be going from a
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh 26% wage replacement to a 35% wage
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
replacement for uh the average uh the 80
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
was that the 86,000 uh
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
earner that was um and sorry that that
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
was somewhat confusing so the
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
35% is looking at the average private
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
sector worker the other the which would
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
be a 35% wage replacement the other
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
statistic I cited was for the
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
individuals that filed for unemployment
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
benefits during
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
2024 their average base period earnings
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
during that four quarter period was
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
88,500 so their wage their actual wage
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
replacement with the current benefit
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
structure was about
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
26% but when we look at the entire
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
private sector Workforce that average
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
private sector worker it'd be about a
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
35% under what is being proposed by
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie follow up yes
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
sir thank you so it it would seem to me
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
unlikely that someone would
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
lollygag uh with that difference in in
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
uh payments they would still be needing
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
to make closer to their normal earnings
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
in the event of her layoff and they
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
haven't found a suitable replacement
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
position even with this uh increase is
 
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.269 align:start position:0%
position even with this uh increase is
that

00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
correct um we do work um uh all of our
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
staff throughout all of the New
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works offices work hard uh
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
with individuals help helping them find
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
employment and individuals do have uh
 
00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:03.559 align:start position:0%
requirements on their weekly claim where
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
they have to document their efforts to
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
make themselves available for work uh
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
they have to show that they're able to
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
work and they have to demonstrate that
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
they are actively searching for work so
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
um without any change to any of those
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
requirements individuals would still be
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
required to contact employers be still
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
required to make that effort and
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
certainly a wage replacement rate that
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
that is providing you with less than
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
half of what you were earning uh
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
provides uh some extra motivation as
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you and repres stop thank you
 
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.350 align:start position:0%
well thank you and repres stop thank you
Mr

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um as I'm looking at the um
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
impacts of the mild recession and the
 
00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.230 align:start position:0%
impacts of the mild recession and the
major

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
recession um it says that at the end of
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
2027 there would be an impact on the
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
amount that employers had to pay um can
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
you describe when that recession when
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
you're predicting that that recession
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
would start I mean is it 2025 2026 and
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
then at the end of 2027 so you know two
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
and a half years or three years or two
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
years um so just to be clear we we are
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
not forecasting there to be a
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
recession um let me say that again New
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security and the
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
economic and labor market information
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
Bureau is not forecasting there to be a
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
recession um but when we apply the
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
stress testing to the trust fund to see
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
how the trust fund would perform under a
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
different benefit schedule that's what
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
you were seeing there so hypotheticals
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
not what we are forecasting um our start
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
our starting uh quarter for each of
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
those hypothetical situations was the
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
third quarter of this year third
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
calendar quarter assuming that if this
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass um that would be the
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
quarter that you would uh see the impact
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh would start me ask a followup yes
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
um so if in that case um we've said that
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
um um you've said that the average
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
amount that employers are paying in per
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
employee is $85 and at the end of 20 27
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
there would be more um they would need
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
to be contributing more do you have you
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
done the math to figure out what um what
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
the average cost per employee would be I
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
kind of did
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
some so the so the average right now
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're correct um the average employers
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
paying at 61% so they pay that on the
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
first $14,000 in annual earnings to each
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
employee for $85 per year right now um
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
so the impact there that you're seeing
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
in both recessionary scenarios is the
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
employers would be for be projected
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
again a lot of assumptions made here um
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
but they would be projected to lose the
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
half Point fund balance reduction so if
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
you were still um at that average 61 or
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
actually you wouldn't be at the average
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
let's make this even more complicated um
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
um you would have already lost a half
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
point because right now they got a full
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
point reduction on their rate right
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
that's what they currently experience um
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
when you go that deep into the recession
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
they would have already lost that full
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
point and they would be at the half
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
point so that average employer at 61
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be um at
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
1.1 um and so by not having that half
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
Point reduction in that first quarter of
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
27 they would actually be at a point and
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
a half
 
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.430 align:start position:0%
a half
1.5%

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
1.5%
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
1.6% would be what they would be paying
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
on the first
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
$144,000 um in annual earnings for each
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
employee comp compared to 1.1 versus is
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
1.6 and when you when you um um
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
calculate the impact the total impact on
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
employers Statewide that's where you get
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
the figure of
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
$22.9 million collectively amongst all
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
employers by not having that half Point
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
discount in that
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
quarter that's clear thank you and
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative Roy or Hall I'm sorry
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
that works fine thank uh thanks for uh
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank thanks for testifying um as I look
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
at this table um a question comes up I
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
it seems to run from the benefits run
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
from 1.14% to
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
1.02 but is there an advantage to having
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
it structured this way versus just
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
having in the statute a straight
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
percentage does this make the
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
Department's job easier does it you know
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
is it saving money somehow I mean would
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
it be better and save the taxpayers
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
money overall would it reduce your costs
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
if we just had in the statute a straight
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
percentage um
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire has always done it this
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
way um with the the benefit table that
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
you see um Can the department do it a
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
different way we certainly can't um
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
there would be uh money and time uh
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
needed to do that to reprogram the
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
current system to calculate that weekly
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
benefit amount differently if we were to
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
calculate it based off of not the the uh
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
earning tiers that you see but as a
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
straight replacement rate for what you
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
actually earned during that four quarter
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
base period um you'd obviously want to
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
put in some sort of uh maximum at which
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to provide that wage
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
replacement I think we've talked before
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
about how social security has a wage cap
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh that they no longer um tax those
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
earnings above I think it's in the mid
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
140s um is how Social Security applies
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
that most short-term disability programs
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Paid Family Leave
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
program they they do it the same way
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
where they cap the uh wage replacement
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
um at that same level um it would um at
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
least based on our current claim filing
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
population with the some of the numbers
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
I provided with those people that uh um
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
qualified for the maximum right now 427
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
those that qualified in 2024 their
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
average base period earnings was over
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
$888,000 over $88,500
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
actually um so there would be a higher
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
benefit cost um depending on what you
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
set your wage replacement rate at um but
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh to do a um um you know to keep a a
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
50% 54% like the current um goal um at
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
the uh 415 which is not what happens in
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
reality because people are earning 885
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
um but to set a a 50% wage replacement
 
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
there would be a significant increase in
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
paid okay representive km thank you
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair and thank you again Mr
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
labers so uh when the uh fund balance
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
reaches a certain level like when when a
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
bell rings the angel gets its
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
wings um so that affects Statewide all
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the employers regardless so their
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
history get a little bit of something or
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of a benefit but uh
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
how does that come down to the the 22
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
million to the individual average
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
employer right now at 85 uh if we pass
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
this would it go to 8550 or $86 annually
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
could you tell us that today
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
um the quick math my father was my high
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
school calculus teacher okay he's
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
probably looking down and wondering how
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
well his lawyer son is going to do um
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
but um you'd be looking at so instead of
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
paying at that again to be Apples to
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
Apples for that particular quarter um
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
without any change employers would be
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
paying at 1.1% on the first 14,000 with
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
this proposed change they'd be paying at
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
1.6% on the first
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
14,000 uh so
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
um I can do that math off of uh
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
when I'm out of the spotlight I do see a
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
few of your colleagues that are doing
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
the math right now so um it's um a sign
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's more than double of probably more
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
than double of what they're paying at 85
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
right now but 85 is not what they'd be
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
paying in that scenario anyway um 85 is
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
only what they're what they're paying
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
right now per employee at 61% is the
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
average employer but the Apples to
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
Apples would be to compare 1.1% versus
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
1.6% well please and and again this is
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
is only on the first 14,000 we're not
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
adjusting that to uh 25,000 or anything
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
crazy correct it's that that uh um that
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
rate the amount of earnings would be
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
there's no um uh um request in this
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
proposal uh from representative McKenzie
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
to change that um and the reason why the
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
impact being as high as it is that $22.9
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
million is because as we've talked about
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
um employers that don't have seasonal
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
patterns to their employment most of
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
their unemployment tax is paid as a
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
result of earnings in that first quarter
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
and it's that first quarter that this
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
proposal would be uh projected to impact
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
in 2027 thank you very much good good
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner labors um
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
utilization typically when the benefits
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
of higher people will stay on
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
unemployment longer um did you means
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
test any of that in here with under the
 
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.630 align:start position:0%
test any of that in here with under the
new

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment so so it's a it's a good
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
question um as um elme Economist Brian
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
golob has pointed out before the
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
existence of an unemployment program
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
increases duration increases the
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
duration of unemployment um but that's
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
why it exists right it's to provide that
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
support rather than fall off a clip and
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
try to dig your way out uh to to
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully find a job on the other side
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
um what these um stress test scenarios
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
did so the answer is yes um because they
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
they they mimicked as best they could
 
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
claim filing behaviors from those two
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
recessionary scenarios so we we
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
obviously started from the current size
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
of the labor force rather than the the
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
prior um configurations of the labor
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
force but so we took our current labor
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
force and we applied that 2001 mild
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
recession um unemployment going from
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now 2 uh 6% going up to 4 and a
 
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
half% um the same patterns with duration
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
that were experienced in that mild
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
relatively short economic downturn of
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
2001 are what were applied there in the
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
mild recession and then the major
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
recession um we applied the the um Great
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
Recession scenario so um 6 and a half%
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
Unemployment uh uh duration um went um a
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
significant increase I believe you were
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
probably in the average duration of
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
probably 18 weeks um in that time period
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
so again we borrowed the behavior years
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
from that time period uh to apply to the
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
um worst case we hope worst case um
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
stress test
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
scenario thank you uh followup Mr
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yes sir thank you um the fund
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
triggers um I know you mentioned them in
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
here so it's actually a two-part
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
question when the fund triggers a
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
reduction or an increase in the taxes
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
are we also going to see some positive
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
rated employers now fall into being
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
negatively rated because of additional
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
the additional expense of utilization
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
and the additional length of time that
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
people will be on it and would they now
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
be not subject
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
to that credit because of the fund
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
balance so the um impact on the fund
 
00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:46.710 align:start position:0%
balance so the um impact on the fund
balance

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
reductions that would not cause an
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
employer to go from positive rated to
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
negative rated right the calculation
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
that could be imp Ed would be um every
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
year um in August we send out our annual
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
redetermination and in that we provide
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
the employer with all of their
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
experience in the entire history of them
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
being an employer in the state of New
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
recalculate their entire amount of taxes
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
paid their entire amount of the benefits
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
we've paid out to their former employees
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
so they were the last employing unit
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
which uh led to someone um being
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
unemployed and eligible for unemployment
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
benefits but we look at all of that and
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
we compare it against their current most
 
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
recent total wages paid and that's what
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
determines whether they're going to be
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
in that um lowest wage uh lowest tax
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
schedule for the positive rated um and
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
then if you're newly negative you go in
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
that mid schedule and then you're
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
chronically negative long-term negative
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
over four years you're you're in that
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
highest wage schedule so if you are
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
right on the uh you know you're you're
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
balanced on the edge of a knife right
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
with being positive rated an increase to
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
the amount of benefits going out could
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
hypothetically could cause you to go
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
negatively rated um you'd be in that
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
second schedule because you'd be you
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
know you'd be a newly negative rated
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
employer um but again if you're if
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
you're right on the cusp of having the
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
amount of benefits paid uh being more
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
than the amount of taxes you have paid
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
um then that could cause you to move to
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
that negative rated schedule but if you
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
haven't had um a a high amount of layoff
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
activity um you've been paying your
 
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
taxes timely and you're um comfortably
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
within that positive R category then it
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cause that but if if someone's
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
right on the edge um yes and an increase
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
in benefits could cause them to go to
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
that higher schedule thank you thank you
 
00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:02.510 align:start position:0%
that higher schedule thank you thank you
Mr

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for the question
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative K thank you Mr chair and
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lers um in your experience
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
with on the topic of
 
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
utilization what's the larger factor is
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
it the benefit amount or the skills uh
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
and age and availability you of
 
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.430 align:start position:0%
and age and availability you of
replacement

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
jobs uh the the biggest the the biggest
 
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.349 align:start position:0%
jobs uh the the biggest the the biggest
Factor

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
um that influences duration is a current
 
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
state of the
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
economy um right now duration is low um
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say it's because of the
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
people that work for the Department
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
doing such a great job of getting people
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
back to work um but duration is low
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
because of the economy it's because New
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire continues to have a strong
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
economy stronger labor force growth than
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
any other state in the entire Northeast
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
exceeding labor force growth of the
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
entire country for the second half of 24
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
um that is what leads to individuals
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
quickly finding employment um because no
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
one wants to be unemployment for longer
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
than they have to be um and that's why
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
no one is here talking about 100% wage
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
replacement um so there needs to always
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh be uh an effort to strike that
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
balance of a wage replacement that can
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
continue to allow you to provide for
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
your family but encourage you to find
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
that new employment opportunity
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully comparable or better than what
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
you had before as quickly as possible
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
but it's always um in my experience the
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
economic conditions um that influence
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
that duration um um unless you go to an
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
extreme like Massachusetts um and you're
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to have uh wage replacement rates
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
that are incredibly High um and even
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
right now um you know New Hampshire
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
we're at 12 weeks average duration
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is Massachusetts right now
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
is at New Hampshire's recessionary
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
duration um they're over 18 weeks so
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of an example of when you um
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh strike uh too far on the other
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
side and are providing too much of a
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate and they don't and
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
their their trust fund is insolvent so
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you res Schultz thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
um to follow up on that conversation I'm
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
wondering to what degree uh does an
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
unemployed person find a job comparable
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
and pay at that higher end of wages are
 
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
do they find are they relegated to
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
crappier wages for lack of a better
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
term um
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
so what we use to gauge um whether or
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
not the job that you are offered is
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
suitable we look at a lot of factors so
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
you can take whatever job you want right
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
um in order to continue to be eligible
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
for unemployment benefits you can't
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
reject an offer of suitable employment
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
and for suitable employment we look at
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
what you were earning before we look at
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
what the proposed earnings are with the
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
job that you were offered we look at a
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
whole host of other factors as well um
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
is it the same shift that you were
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
previously working um what are your
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
reasons for not being able to
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
potentially take this shift you know are
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
there family responsibilities um what's
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
the commuting distance what is the um
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
job itself how does it compare to what
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
you previously did so we look at all of
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
that and it's not just because you Deni
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
you turn down a job offer that we're
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
automatically going to say that you
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
you're no longer eligible for
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment we need to make sure that
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
is suitable um but an individual can
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
accept whatever job that they want um
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
and stop filing obviously if you're um
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
working only part-time you could
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
continue to file New Hampshire allows
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
part-time workers
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh to continue to file for unemployment
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
but that's how we um look at those
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
situations if you if you refuse a job
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
offer we we do the um our our staff are
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
skilled on looking at whether or not an
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
offer was suitable or
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
not for a
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair um you
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
didn't really answer my question but
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
everything you said was informative and
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
I appreciated that because I learned a
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
few things um so say someone is going on
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
um unemployment in the average economy
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a little a little bit of a
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
recession but you know whatever um and
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
they are making say 880,000 uh a year on
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
the white color job I'd heard that um
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
the New
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a good job market but not
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
for the $80,000 white collar job
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily that's really my question so
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
if someone's unemployed they've been
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
laid off or you know their business
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
shuts down whatever um are they so in
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
addition to comparable uh suitable
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
replacement do you maybe you just don't
 
00:53:03.309 --> 00:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
know the statistic to what degree are
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
people able to find you know similar
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
enough wages in their next job after a
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
period of
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment um and so I would just look
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh point you back to the average
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
duration right now uh where um
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
individuals are filing for um just over
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
12 weeks despite having 26 available the
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
average private sector earnings
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
continues to go up um all of those are
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
indicators that um uh people are not
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
just feeling they need to take whatever
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
job is offered to them um people uh you
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
know they're they're quickly able to
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
find uh what they believe um in their
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
situation is suitable and I would assume
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
be comparable to what they were were
 
00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:50.150 align:start position:0%
be comparable to what they were were
previously

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
earning and represent stop thank you Mr
 
00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:55.109 align:start position:0%
earning and represent stop thank you Mr
chairman

00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
um there are some Industries in the
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
state Advanced manufacturing Etc that
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
are always saying well we have plenty of
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
job openings but the jobs are very
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
specialized and so there are shortages
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
in those Industries so I guess my
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
is are those people those people tend to
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
be at the higher end of the scale who
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
are only getting like if they lose that
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
job they get like a 25% replacement and
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
it may be a while before another job
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
opening comes in that field um
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
are we likely to lose that person to
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
another state and then continue to have
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
this shortage in our own state of you
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
know highly skilled specialized um
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
workers um so New Hampshire hasn't
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
experienced an increase in the number of
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
of residents that are are working
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire um you know it
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
continues to be what it was prior to the
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic um with some um slight change
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
with the number of people that are
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
working remote obviously ly is that has
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
increased uh since the pandemic um but
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
you have about 120,000 New Hampshire
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
residents that commute out of state uh
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
to work um and we get about 880,000
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
people that commute into the state uh to
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
work um what we do for those individuals
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
that um um are looking to gain the
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
skills in a particular high demand
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
occupation uh we have several different
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
training programs that can provide uh
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
financial support and one-on-one case
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
management with an employment counselor
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
we connect them with the uh training
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
institutions most instances that's going
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
to be one of our community college
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
system campuses um but we connect them
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
with the training opportunities in most
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
instances if you're uh a dislocated
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
worker um you're going to be able to get
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
that training paid for um not out of
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
your own pocket you're going to get it
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh paid for pour out of the um Workforce
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
Innovation Opportunity Act dollars that
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh come in from the federal government
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
um but we also have other training
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
programs for individuals coming off that
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
are on Medicaid snap tanif we pay for
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
their training as well we try to
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
encourage them into high demand
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
occupations particularly in those
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
sectors that we know offer good solid
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
career trajectory and the and the state
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
has a critical need for like healthcare
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
individuals don't always make those
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
choices um as uh but we try to encourage
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
them into those fields but there's a lot
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
training all right sir I hope I

don't don't hurt yourself represent
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
K I'd like to open the H open the uh
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
reopen the hearing on HP
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
744 and uh much like the HP 542 is that
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
we we had a great discussion on 744 but
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
there were some things that needed to be
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
worked on it and uh representive
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
McKenzie's done a lot of good work um to
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
get at some of those issues and so we
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
like to hear about that I'm just going
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
to state that I have to step out at
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
11:30 and representative avalani will uh
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
assume the the chairmanship while I'm
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
gone um but representative McKenzie can
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
you sort of recap on where we're at and
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
then uh describe your Amendment and uh
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
before we move forward thank you sure
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Mark
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
McKenzie at Hillsboro District
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
40 and I'm here to present the amendment
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.309 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
744

01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
744
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
FN so the original uh legislation uh was
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
focused on one section of the law and in
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Department of
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
Labor it was brought to my attention
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
that there were other sections of the
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
law that were affected and therefore
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
they they asked uh to to forward an
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
amendment which would take into
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
consideration all the areas of the law
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
um that were affected I I ran this by
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
them uh They said that the corrections
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
had been made and that the uh change is
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout the
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
law and that is essentially what the
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that that was restructuring
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment now it doesn't change the
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
initial um proposal which is to move the
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
rate from 60% to 66 and
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
23% for those areas of the law uh that
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
involve the emity
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
benefits and if I could Mr chairman uh I
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
would like to just uh give a very
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
brief um uh presentation relative to put
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
this in
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
context uh and I think I sent you some
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
of this uh some of this
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
stuff this uh this uh period reform
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
period I would say began sometime in the
 
01:06:14.029 --> 01:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
uh in the early
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
90s uh and it was uh the Catalyst for it
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
was a a proposed increase of 37% in the
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in the uh workers
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
compensation rate
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
it caused a um a series of uh reform
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
study committees it was one uh that took
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
place in the 90 and then
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
93 so you did one under Governor
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
um uh Greg one under Governor Merill and
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
one under Governor
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
Lynch the two first ones were probably
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the most
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
um were probably the most impactful on
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
the system Governor Lynch didn't uh his
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
commission didn't report out much I was
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
actually on it um and
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
so what we what we ended up with was
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
this series of reforms and this was one
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
of those reforms that took place under
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
1409 now also included uh uh at the time
 
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.349 align:start position:0%
1409 now also included uh uh at the time
was

01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh was a a ser series of things which
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
were were done to affect the overall
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
rate give you an example without going
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
too far into the
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
weeds um they adopted things like uh AMA
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh schedules for Disabilities the whole
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
idea of of work as compensation is to
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
try to uh to to try to insulate I mean
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at pricing it the
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner the insurance department is
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
there but you want to limit risk
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
um and I say that in the sense that uh
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
there is this balance that you try to
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
achieve in the law you try to achieve uh
 
01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
get to a place where the benefits are
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient because the law uh is a
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
tradeoff workers's compensation
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
represents a trade-off between the
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
employer and the worker and the idea is
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
that the worker uh loses for the most
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
part except in some really unreasonable
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
cases the ability to sue the employer
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the Qui quo is that there is this
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
system of benefits and so over the
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
course of these reforms they chipped
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
away at the benefits uh to get the cost
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
what they think said is a cost in line
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
and it and if you heard recently that it
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
has resulted over a period of some 20
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
years in reducing uh the cost of uh UI
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
now I cost of work as comp
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh but I would suggest that those those
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
were uh the the the industry has
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
recovered uh there were representatives
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
from the industry that here to suggest
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
that the industry is in good shape is a
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
good line of business so this is one of
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
one of the many
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
things um that I think need some
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
attention and
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
essentially what this will do is to
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
restore that uh that piece of the law
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
that was reduced to 60% under house bill
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
1409 now pretty much around the country
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
the rate for the replacement rate for
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
the indemnity side of the of the agenda
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
is is 66 and 23 essentially uh
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the country I don't know if
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's in every state uh that's what we
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
heard I'm not sure it's in every state
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
but that's a that uh would take some
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
research on on my part to figure if
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's actually accurate but the
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
majority of states will say pay 66 and
 
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.149 align:start position:0%
majority of states will say pay 66 and
2/3

01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
2/3
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
now I I think there's a lot of
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
justification for restoring this you
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
know at the same time they were reducing
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
this they were also rolling back things
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of the length of time you could
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
be on
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
disability so at one point you could be
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
on disability for 350 weeks at the same
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
almost in the same page that they were
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
taking the 60% they were cutting that
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
back to 262 weeks so these are the kinds
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
of things that were happening and we got
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
caught up in it and I think by the
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard is that the
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
industry has recovered there were
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
hundred I think it was testimony there
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
were 100 people doing workers
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
compensation in the state offering it in
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
the early 90s there was one and that
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
particular company was going to pull out
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
and this was not only the case here it
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
was the case in Maine it was the case in
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
other places in this country
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
so something needed to be done and
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
something was done now you might some
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
people might say well well that was a
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
deal and you know things don't change
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
well in fact things have changed uh one
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
of the cornerstones of this for workers
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
was to keep in place uh the safety and
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
health plans so part of our demand when
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
we were going through this was that we
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
wanted programs that would make the
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
workplaces safer and they did that and I
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
think the evidence will show the dity
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
benefits are about 40% of the cost as
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to 60% of the uh o of the the
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
cost of insurance so we have done a
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
pretty good job of making workplace
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
safer which is an upside of of this but
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
there have been changes to that for
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
instance when we originally negotiated
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
this it were uh you needed U it was 10
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
employees I believe that you need a
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
safety plan you had to file it each year
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's up to 15 now and you don't
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
have to file it each year anymore so
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
that was a big change uh that they made
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
they made some other changes uh also uh
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
in a while they dealt with
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
things uh around safety committees in
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
general um so they have made changes in
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
this but not none of the things that
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
really impact the the cost of the
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
program this will impact the cost of the
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
program uh I you have some analysis that
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
was done by The ncci Who is the agency
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
that ENT
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
does a
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
rating uh for the uh for the system and
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
they show and I think the insurance
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
department indicated this kind of off
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
the cuff and I think it's we're right in
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
line it's it's between five uh and
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
6.3% increase in the in the work in the
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
workers compensation rate I also uh was
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
given some information from the ncci
 
01:12:51.719 --> 01:12:53.110 align:start position:0%
given some information from the ncci
which

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
I um V loss cost filing history is a
 
01:12:59.229 --> 01:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
little out of my
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse but I think if I get this
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
right if I understand this is is there
 
01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
has uh been a series of
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
decreases uh and the insurance company
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
can re and if I'm misstating this I'm
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
sure I'll be corrected but there seems
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
to be a trend where the where the where
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
the actual cost of the insurance has
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
been has been going down it's it's
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
varied over a period of years is from 19
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
to 2025 from a high
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
of-4 to a low of uh I think 1.8 back in
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
2021 projection is minus
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
5.6 so if I get that right it looks like
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
trending um it's we're in a position
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
where uh where there have been some
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
decreases but again I may not have that
 
01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
correct and I hope somebody would would
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
correct that if I'm misstating it so Mr
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
chairman I think the the this this
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
simply restor of benefit uh I could
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
spend three days talking about the
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
workers comp reform um but I think it's
 
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
given that there are 100 people offering
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
this today that the system has recovered
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
that there's some room to go back and
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
restore some of the stuff that occurred
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
over the course of the years and uh I in
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
this this particular piece has been as
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative aino knows this has been
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee on more than
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
one occasion
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
uh but I think we have pretty good
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
evidence now that this makes sense to
 
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.229 align:start position:0%
evidence now that this makes sense to
restore

01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you for your your work and
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
clarifying that and updating the bill as
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
as amended are there any questions
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative K thank you Mr chair and
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
question um so I I've noticed that in
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment we are not going
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
retroactive which would be very
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
complicated we are merely going forward
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
from the after the acct is that correct
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct that was uh that was
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
something that we need to clarify from
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the last hearing we did so so this will
 
01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
be only for injuries that occurred uh on
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
or after January 1st of uh 2026 thank
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
you okay good question any other
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions repres clar thank you is it
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
true that most of the states in the
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
country have the 66 and 2/3 that's
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
that's mine standing and I think there
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
was testimony from the insurance
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
Department relative to that as
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
well okay Roger thank
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions sir
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
please please uh state your name and who
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
you represent for the record thank you
 
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
Nathan fennessy uh I'm an attorney at
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
pretty flarity here in conquer I
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
represent ncci good to see most of you
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh back again uh I did bring hard copies
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
I sent out to the committee the analysis
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
that ncci performed if you could just
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
hand those to both sides so we can send
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
so I won't go through all of the
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
analysis but I I did want to just
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple of things I'm sure
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
you've had an opportunity to review it
 
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
at this point um ncci after doing the
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
calculations uh and as I understand it
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment uh reflects what was
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last public hearing
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
which is what we uh base the analysis on
 
01:17:00.629 --> 01:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh as representative mckenny McKenzie
 
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
sorry uh said the estimate is that the
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
if an acted it would result in an impact
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
of between 5% and 6.3% increase on
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
overall workers comp system costs in New
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that's based on the private
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
Market um we did include a footnote uh
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's footnote one at the bottom of page
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
one so
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh the 5% to 6.3% is based upon our
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
calculations that based on the private
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
Market there be an increase between 12
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
million and 15 million in overall
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
workers comp system
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
costs uh we don't get data about
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
self-insured but uh there's an
 
01:17:49.629 --> 01:17:49.639 align:start position:0%
organization called uh the National
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
Academy of social
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
insurance which has some data uh we
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is but they have
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
certain information about self-insurers
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and based on their data
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
we did make an estimate that if you
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
include what they uh consider to be the
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh self-insured Market in New Hampshire
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
that uh the range would be between 17
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
million and 22 million so you know
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
approximately five uh to um to uh 7
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
million more as far as overall workers
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
comp system costs and that's a ass uming
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
we use the same percentage that the the
 
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
same percentage would apply to those in
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
market one thing I I did want to
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
highlight and this came up at the last
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing so there are different
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
types of benefits uh so the calculations
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
are slightly different um based upon one
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the one of the factors that we
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
considered was utilization uh NCC has
 
01:18:58.030 --> 01:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
done analysis in the past that shows
 
01:18:59.790 --> 01:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
that if you increase the indemnity
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
benefit there's an increase in
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
utilization which basically means people
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
may stay on the benefit longer so uh for
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
purposes of the
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
calculation uh we used uh different
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
utilization factors based on different
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
benefits so uh if you look at the chart
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
on uh page
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
three uh we broke out the essentially
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
the four different types of benefits
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
that there are and then uh showed the uh
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
the share of the indemnity losses
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
overall in the system so for example the
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
Fatal injury type makes up about 4.8% of
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
the overall uh emity losses in New
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we then uh performed a
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
calculation so the analysis was
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
essentially that this increase from 60
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
to um 6 and 2/3 was approximately
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
97% in direct Indemnity cost going so in
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
the in the Fatal category uh that works
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
out to 99.4% there's no change to
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
utilization we didn't because you know
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
if you die you're not going to use it
 
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
anymore uh but then we did going down to
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh permanent total
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
disability uh that's only 1.3% and then
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
we have estimates of again there's no
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
change to the the utilization because if
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's permanent total disability
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to change the really
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
change is going to happen with the two
 
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
categories of uh permanent partial and
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh total um total temporary disability
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
or um total
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh I'm blanking on the other one but we
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
calculate them the same the
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
total uh partial disability because it's
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
calculated the same way uh and we use
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
slightly different utilization factors
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
based on the analysis that ncci has done
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
in the past to come up with the the
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
lower bound and the upper bound
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
estimates which are reflected there uh
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
again you're looking at uh 41.9% is the
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
permanent partial disability category uh
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
and 52% is the temporary total dis
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
ability piece uh we then if you uh
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
multiply those all together and uh you
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
then come up with a lower bound estimate
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
of 12.2% to
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
15.3% uh but then you have to uh uh
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
divide by uh 41% because only uh 41% of
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
the overall system uh cost is associated
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
with the indemnity benefit which gives
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
the 5% to 6.3% range that we
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
provided if anybody wants to uh ask any
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to take them yeah so
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
first of all I appreciate you turning
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
this around as you said you would by
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
last Friday thank you and for sending
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
that out to everyone just just from my
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
own clarification who pays these costs
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
this five to six
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
6.3% who's whose pocket does that come
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
from so the five to 6.3% the assumption
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
is that's
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
overall uh system costs now in the
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
private system the assumption would be
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
that uh at least some if not all of that
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
would be picked up through an increase
 
01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.350 align:start position:0%
would be picked up through an increase
in

01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
premium okay so that's a premium PID by
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
the the employer by the employer correct
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
questions represent Clair yeah thank you
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
so the utilization part doesn't a doctor
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
typically let a person on work on work
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
as comp know how long they should be out
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
and you know when they could go back to
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
work obviously depending on the type of
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
job they have but doesn't yeah doesn't a
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
doctor more tell them how long they
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
should be out more than a person saying
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be out for 10 weeks a
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
doctor might say no six does that really
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
how it works yeah I I would say that is
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
generally true however um and CCI has
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
done analysis over time and and when
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
there's been changes in Indemnity
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
benefits they've seen in the
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
categories uh that are either permanent
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
partial or uh temporary total there
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
tends to be a slight increase in uh
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
utilization for uh individuals so um
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
whereas before maybe they were um on uh
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
workers comp for you know 20 weeks
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
incrementally it may go up to 21 or 22
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
weeks and so that that's uh based on
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
those observations and calculations that
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
ncci has done in the past uh in pricing
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
this we made the assumption that that
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
would hold true with a similar type of
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh increase
 
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
here for followup sir yeah thank
 
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
you but so are you saying that they're
 
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
going against what their position might
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
tell them I I don't know I I don't know
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
what the conversations might be between
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
an individual worker and their doctor
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
doctor uh I can just tell you that based
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
on what ncci's done in the past with
 
01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
information that they've had they've
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
observed this phenomenon where uh
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers uh when there's a rate
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
increase may stay on the benefit
 
01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.430 align:start position:0%
increase may stay on the benefit
slightly

01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
longer all right thanks okay K thank you
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
question uh so workers comp uh a bit
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
like uh unemployment insurance is is not
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
universally the same rate if you have if
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
you're a roofing company your rates are
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
probably a little higher than if you had
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
a coffee shop so it's so the rate
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
increase isn't spread across the whole
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh State of New Hampshire all the
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
employers it's going to be effective by
 
01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
the type of business they have is that
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
correct and their experience that's
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
correct so I I'll give you sort of the
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
very basic you have uh a classification
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
code so uh if you have a roofing company
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
the classification code likely uh is uh
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
I'll call it the the rate is higher than
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
clerical uh but then you also have an
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
experience rating modification so you
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
the individual company could have a
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
different uh higher or lower based on
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
how many claims that you have had in the
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
past as your company itself so I I I
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
like to think about there's sort of two
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
separate aspects to uh coming up with
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
that follow up please thank you so so
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
then the employer you know acting in
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
their best interest and the interest
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
your employees will in Institute the the
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
best more robust uh safety program
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
encourage the roofers to have the the
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
harness and and all those things not
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
take any shortcuts to uh
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
right I would say that there is a
 
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
financial benefit if you are
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing claims losses and your
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
experience rating modification goes up
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
there is a financial incentive for you
 
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
to take uh safety precautions to drive
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
that number down in the future thank you
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
represent King thank you Mr chair and
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
had a question looking at your
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
statistics here would the um specific
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
businesses that have a higher rate of
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
let's say code right now would they see
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
think

01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know I don't know it would
 
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
depend on sort of how it played out
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
across the different classification
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
codes um I I I don't know that sitting
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
right right
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
here representative avalani thank you Mr
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
you talked about
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
utilization um some Industries have
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
longer utilization than
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
others um you figure you know a more of
 
01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
an office setting is going to be back to
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
work quicker than somebody that's broken
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
their leg falling off a
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
ladder um how does that square
 
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.030 align:start position:0%
ladder um how does that square
with

01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
the impact overall
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
for getting back to work without
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
extending the utilization because you're
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
getting paid more to stay home while
 
01:27:54.679 --> 01:27:56.149 align:start position:0%
getting paid more to stay home while
you're

01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
injured so I would say the numbers that
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
we used there were just sort of we used
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
a range uh for each of those categories
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
so uh while it may be true that um that
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
someone who suffers a more severe injury
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be on uh the benefit for longer uh
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
we didn't really get into the
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
particulars of how it would impact one
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
uh classification code versus another
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
classific ification code thank you
 
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman for followup uh
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
right now the payment system has
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
41% for wage replacement or Indemnity
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
payments um with increased utilization
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
will would require a change in that and
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
given that some in insurance people have
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
a very small margin given higher
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
healthier costs administrative
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
costs uh independent doctor costs
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
utilization claims
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
how does that translate into just a 5%
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
possible um private insurance going up
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
so uh I mean based on the analysis that
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
we did which uh factors in um
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
essentially what the impact to Indemnity
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
um our analysis that was that the range
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
would be between five and
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
6.3% now over time uh the the 41%
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
obviously could increase in the future
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know if that's going to be true
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
or not but it could go up from 41% to
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
some other uh higher portion of the
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
overall benefit because if you're
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
increasing the indemnity presumably it
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
would go it would go above 41% at some
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
point um but I will say over the
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
last probably five to six years the
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
indemnity so of the gross amount of
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
Indemnity has generally remained about
 
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
the same um and the the rate decreases
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we have seen have been dra have
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
been derived almost uh exclusively
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
through an a an incre or decrease in
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
frequency of medical claims and then the
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
severity of the claims generally has
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
gone down over time which means that the
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
medical portion of the benefits gone
 
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.510 align:start position:0%
medical portion of the benefits gone
down

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
on on sort of on a on a gross
 
01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
level oh if I can just uh because I know
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
represent McKenzie uh raised what I
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
provided to him was uh a slide that we
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
provided to the insurance department
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
with our rate filing for
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
2025 which showed I have a copy of it
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
with me right here it basically showed
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
what the history of the loss CA filings
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
have been since uh
 
01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:51.639 align:start position:0%
2019 and the loss cost filing is
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
essentially the I'll call it the the
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
rate uh that ncci is filing for purposes
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the voluntary Market this is
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
different than the assigned risk pool uh
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking with the
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
exception of um well actually it's gone
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
down every single year since 2019 so
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's year-over-year
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
um in 2021 the filing was for a 1.8 uh
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
percent decrease which um was the lowest
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
decrease uh but uh the filing we made
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
which was approved by the department uh
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
this fall for starting on January 1
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
2025 Was A 5.6 5.6 decrease from the
 
01:31:38.119 --> 01:31:41.310 align:start position:0%
2025 Was A 5.6 5.6 decrease from the
year

01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.669 --> 01:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
prior I hope that answered the question
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
and for a followup sure um so we talked
 
01:31:47.719 --> 01:31:50.709 align:start position:0%
and for a followup sure um so we talked
about

01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
the voluntary Market but there's also an
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
involuntary Market which is your
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
assigned risk correct did you look at
 
01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
that in relations to this 5 to 6% or is
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
that going to be a different hold that's
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
a whole different ballpark with my
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is that was part of the
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
analysis that was done uh because
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
because we we do that filing on behalf
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the assigned risk pool in New
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so my understanding is that
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's part of this
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
analysis thank you I'll save my next
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
questions for the insurance commissioner
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
all right good represent K sir thank you
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you again and um I'm
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
not really a math wizard but I'm not
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
either oh my God U maybe someone else in
 
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
earshot but I was looking at the we
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
talked about 86,000 annual salary that
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
is somewhat common in New Hampshire
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
though not in this room um and I just
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
sort of ran you know 60% times that it
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
was like $992 a week and I think it was
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
a you know with the 66 and 23 it was
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
another $110
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
is that sound close to anyone's uh math
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
Wizardry $110 more a week that they
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
would get would they would they utilize
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
it much longer for $110 a week I I I
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the math uh because I'm
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not good at math uh in front of a
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
crowd uh so I I can't speak to uh the
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
motivations individuals might have I
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
would say that it uh if you look at the
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
benefits it's not strictly 60% and 66
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
and 23 there's an analysis as to how the
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
average weekly wage compares to certain
 
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
things so it's a little bit more nuanced
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
I would say than just a strict 60% right
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
much all right seeing no further
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you sir I appreciate
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
the quick turnaround and the detailed
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
analysis thank you and I'm going to step
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
out and hand a gavel over to
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative avalani for the rest of
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing thank you thank you Mr
 
01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.550 align:start position:0%
the hearing thank you thank you Mr
chairman

01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
um Christian cerella I'm guessing from
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
department thank you for being here with
 
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.790 align:start position:0%
department thank you for being here with
us

01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
me hello my name is Christian citarella
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
I am the chief Property and Casualty
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
actuary at the New Hampshire insurance
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
department Department I have reviewed
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
the analysis of the ncci I believe their
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
range of estimates for the change to
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
loss cost due to the proposed change in
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
in in benefit is reasonable and actuly
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
sound I think it is important though to
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the anticipated change
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
to loss costs does not necessarily
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
mean uh premiums will adjust by the same
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
factor uh loss cost are strictly the
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
underlying costs as Mr fennessy
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
described these are the underlying costs
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
that an insurance carrier has to pay out
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
the claims that that occur loss costs do
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
not account for other expenses to an
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company such as overhead
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
marketing uh completing Audits and of
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
and some profit provision each carrier
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
will likely adjust their premium as they
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
deem necessary um considering the kind
 
01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:15.159 align:start position:0%
of business that they deal with as was
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the types of uh the types of
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
employers that they sell their business
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
to um and kind of the overall Market
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
approach each carrier is going to
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
interpret these changes slightly
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
differently um
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
but I would I would so because of all
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
that I would be surprised if if in the
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
end the effect of this legislation would
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
result in an overall average premium
 
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
increase of that 6.3% high upper bound
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
that was presented by
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
ncci nevertheless I do concede after
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
reviewing the work of ncci that the
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
change to premium would likely be
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
greater than the than than the upper
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
bound my upper bound last week of 4% so
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
there is every reason to believe after
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
looking at their analysis that yes we're
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
looking at somewhere in the five to six%
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
effect in the end on
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
premium so let me be clear passage of
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
the spill would very likely result in
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
increased workers compensation loss
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
costs for the first time in more than a
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
decade um Mr fen's um chart that he
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
showed goes back to 2019 but in fact
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
we've had decreases in our state for
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
loss costs what did I say third it's
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
been 13 years so it's at 20 what are we
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
now 20 25 so it's been back to 2012
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen decreases and it's been
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
consistently decreasing every year with
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
that one blip was a 2021 where it was a
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
very very small decrease but a decrease
 
01:36:41.199 --> 01:36:42.750 align:start position:0%
very very small decrease but a decrease
nonetheless

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
um so if we do have an increase this
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
time around due to this legislation you
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
know that would trigger an increase in
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
workers compensation premium paid by
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
business owners throughout the State and
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's important and the commissioner told
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
me to remind you all that the insurance
 
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
Market as a whole is a is in very
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
difficult time right now that in you
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
know business owners employers are
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
purchasing Insurance of many different
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
kinds different types different
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
coverages we got they have Commercial
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
Auto they've got property they've got
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
general liability that they purchase all
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
of these other types of insurances the
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
the premiums are going up workers
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
compensation has been the one kind of
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
bright spot in the insurance Market in
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in many other parts of
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
the the country
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
where you know premiums aren't going
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
down as as the loss costs are going down
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
at the same rate
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
but but things are very very stable very
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
um affordable right now and so it's kind
 
01:37:43.229 --> 01:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
of that one bright spot in the insurance
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
world and uh the commissioner this
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
morning wanted me to make sure you all
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
knew that uh that do we really want to
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
mess with that one bright spot guess is
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
the way uh he he wanted to impress upon
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
you um but again this this is a balance
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
between you know benefits to workers and
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
you know to be clear as mentioned New
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an outlier when it comes to
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
that benefit to you know uh wage
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
replacement um you know nationally but
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
then to balance the other side of the
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
effect on premium to employers and so
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's your decision to make um so I'm
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative K shair and
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
um in in the area of insurance is uh
 
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
workers comp unique in that it is sort
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
of what the employer does that has a
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
larger impact than when you say property
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a flood in California
 
01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
if there's a flood in California
everybody

01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
pays right I mean the
 
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know natural disasters do affect
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
property insurance more broadly across
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
the whole country and internationally
 
01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
for that matter so because of the effect
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
of uh costs of
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
reinsurance workers comp I would say is
 
01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit more isolated from those
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
effects you know to an extent I
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
mean you know for certain types of
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
employers and certain types of workers
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
there just isn't enough experience
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
within our state to develop their own
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
rates and so we may look to similarly
 
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
situated workers in other states to then
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
develop and when by say we it's ncci
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
that does the analysis we review it but
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
and then we approve it but yes so short
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
answer yes it is more protected more
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
isolated than than other types of
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
coverage yeah follow up follow so again
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
most of the most of the impa
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh the the rate increase that an employ
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
a given employer would have is based on
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
their industry and their history uh and
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
their ability to change that by being
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
really focused on safety is that correct
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
oh yes yes and and I do think that
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's part of the one of the main
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
reasons that we have seen these loss
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
costs going down over the last decade is
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
implementation of safety measures risk
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
mitigation um and you know just better
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
practices within the within you know on
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
the factory floor you know one more Yep
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you again so if the
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
worker is injured this is obviously uh
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
you know something not that they didn't
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't jump off the ladder this is
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
an involuntary thing that no one
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated and their income is reduced
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
if this law passes you know to 66 and
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
2/3 do don't they have an incentive to
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
get back to work as soon as they're
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
right I the decision to go back to
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
work it it it's it is based on you know
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
what the doctor is going to approve
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
right but to Mr fen's
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
point that the correlation is there that
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
there there in you know historically
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
there has been an uptick in utilization
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
when there's been an increase in
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
gently I'll push back uh to that
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
analysis in that we're probably due for
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
an updated analysis in that regard
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
because it has been a while since that
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
work has been done and the economy is
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
different than it was and and and there
 
01:41:43.709 --> 01:41:43.719 align:start position:0%
are many factors that go into that um
 
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
but yeah it is true that if if you're
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
going to if there is a greater Indemnity
 
01:41:53.229 --> 01:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
benefit you know that it does correlate
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
utilization one one more final
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so for $110 a week
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
more uh an an employer an employee might
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
talk to his doctor and say well this is
 
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
really still hurting me is that is that
 
01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.149 align:start position:0%
really still hurting me is that is that
the

01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
fear intuitively that that seems I guess
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's the logical conclusion that for
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
some reason and we don't know I mean it
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell us why it's just numbers do
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
seem to parallel you know that when
 
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
there's a higher benefit there's greater
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
utilization that seems to be the
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
intuitive approach I guess yeah thank
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
questions um now there was one other
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
thing if I might I had thrown out a
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
number last week and I just wanted to
 
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
kind of give a little more around that
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
number and that's the number of writers
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
in the state I said that there were over
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
a 100 writers in the state and that is
 
01:42:57.870 --> 01:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
true there are right now there areund
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
well as of this is 2023 data there are
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
112 insurance carriers that have WR that
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
wrote more than one more than 0.1% of
 
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
the market so there are 112 ins
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
individual insurance companies that are
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
active in the state many of them are
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
affiliated so like a you take it in like
 
01:43:20.189 --> 01:43:20.199 align:start position:0%
a liberty or a Travelers and they're
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to have many different companies
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
inside that umbrella and so if we look
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
at groups like an insurance an
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
affiliation of insurance carriers or a
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
group of carriers we're looking at about
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
60 groups that write more than 0.1% of
 
01:43:34.719 --> 01:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
60 groups that write more than 0.1% of
the

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.750 align:start position:0%
the
market

01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
so it's still a very very healthy Market
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
in short sorry any further
 
01:43:51.589 --> 01:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
um is there a fear of or an expectation
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
that if wage replacement percentages go
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
up that
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
certain carriers might drop the more
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
expensive clients that have a
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
recurring issues with workman's
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
compensation um I don't I wouldn't be
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
able to answer that with any level of
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
confidence I
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
mean there are representatives of of the
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
insurance industry at least there were
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
behind me earlier that might be a
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
question for
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
them the change being
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
proposed this is the way I think about
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
it you know going to 66 and 23% wage
 
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
replacement is very very common that
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
amount of you know that benefit is very
 
01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
common around the country every
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company that writes workers
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
comp in New Hampshire writes it in at
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
least two or three other states and most
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
of them write Nationwide you know and so
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
this this isn't in my opinion this is
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
not this would not not be a debilitating
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
change to any insurance carrier I don't
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
I don't see this as the thing that they
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
would then say no we're not going to
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
write you
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
you correct but would that Force more
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
people off the voluntary market and into
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
the involuntary Market with for their
 
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
experience it would just mean that it
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
would be no because the involuntary
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
Market would be more expensive as well
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
and and this is the sort of thing where
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
again this is my opinion
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
I can't speak on behalf of the insurance
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
companies but as a regulator and just
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
way I see the the market run it's just
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like that would have any
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
measurable effect on the appetite you
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
know on the on the appetite that
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers would have in writing
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
business thank you any further
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
you anybody else wish to speak on this
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
7:44 uh we have a
 
01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
one we have a one o'clock exec
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
session and the chairman wants you to
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.840 --> 01:47:21.830 align:start position:0%

03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
work to make bills more uh compatible
 
03:04:45.349 --> 03:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
and understandable and as such as my
 
03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
Deputy reminded me this is my
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted wound but at the end of
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
the day I do respect what everyone's
 
03:04:53.710 --> 03:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
doing and we've got seven
 
03:04:57.630 --> 03:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
amendments okay so I talk to Paul Smith
 
03:04:59.190 --> 03:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
this morning just to make sure we got
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
this right and I just want to review the
 
03:05:02.990 --> 03:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
bidding for everyone so we can keep
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves honest okay so what what's
 
03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
going to happen if there's a mo if
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment on a bill the
 
03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
person with the amendment will introduce
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as ought to pass as an ought to
 
03:05:18.990 --> 03:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
pass motion with Amendment
 
03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay then and then that person will be
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity to explain the
 
03:05:24.750 --> 03:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and we can have a discussion
 
03:05:27.150 --> 03:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
on Amendment and then we'll vote on the
 
03:05:30.349 --> 03:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment will either pass
 
03:05:33.469 --> 03:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
or fail if the amendment fails then
 
03:05:35.710 --> 03:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the original motion of a to
 
03:05:39.309 --> 03:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
pass if a to pass passes then off to
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
pass and off we go if off to pass fails
 
03:05:45.389 --> 03:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
then a new motion will be made for
 
03:05:48.670 --> 03:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
itl or or could be to retain or whatever
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
the new motion would be all right and
 
03:05:54.190 --> 03:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
then so we'll go through that now of the
 
03:05:57.389 --> 03:05:57.399 align:start position:0%
nine bills we're doing that seven times
 
03:05:58.870 --> 03:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is why I just wanted to go through
 
03:05:58.880 --> 03:06:00.150 align:start position:0%
which is why I just wanted to go through
the

03:06:00.150 --> 03:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:04.510 --> 03:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
process um as as I've research this more
 
03:06:07.030 --> 03:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are straight are
 
03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:07.750 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are straight are
there

03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:06:11.070 --> 03:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
any issues with that any questions
 
03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
comments yes sir of course I just wanted
 
03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
to express my appreciation to the home
 
03:06:19.469 --> 03:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
that you did because I was a little
 
03:06:22.229 --> 03:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
unclear about the process and by the
 
03:06:24.030 --> 03:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
time we get to the fifth one I think
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be good at
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
it we'll see but no I I did I asked the
 
03:06:31.070 --> 03:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
question four times I got four different
 
03:06:34.150 --> 03:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
answers so I went to the mountain and
 
03:06:36.510 --> 03:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
and I talked to Paul this morning I I
 
03:06:38.910 --> 03:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
think even if we're not right we're
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
right enough but quite honestly I think
 
03:06:44.309 --> 03:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
I think we're good to go okay so to lead
 
03:06:45.790 --> 03:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
off this
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh I opened hearing on HB 248
 
03:06:52.269 --> 03:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
representative Flanigan do you have a
 
03:06:54.910 --> 03:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I do have a
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
motion I have a motion to OTP with an
 
03:06:59.550 --> 03:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'd like to have the
 
03:07:01.150 --> 03:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce the amendment
 
03:07:02.990 --> 03:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
once it's as soon as we get a second do
 
03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
we have a second
 
03:07:07.550 --> 03:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
yes yes Warden second and do you want to
 
03:07:09.469 --> 03:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
speak to your Amendment yes very briefly
 
03:07:10.750 --> 03:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
because there really wasn't a lot of
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
changes um if one remembers the uh
 
03:07:16.990 --> 03:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for the uh uh state employees
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
union came in because they was concerned
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
that there was the already existing
 
03:07:24.429 --> 03:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
language in the CBA that they had uh and
 
03:07:27.269 --> 03:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh what I did was I amended this bill on
 
03:07:28.910 --> 03:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
the last sentence saying this section
 
03:07:30.670 --> 03:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to employees covered
 
03:07:32.870 --> 03:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
under collective bargaining agreements
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
and that's it and uh I think we met the
 
03:07:37.630 --> 03:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
objectives that and I think the vice
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%

03:07:41.670 --> 03:07:41.680 align:start position:0%

discussion on this bill representative
 
03:14:28.830 --> 03:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
Susi thank you Mr chairman uh I'm going
 
03:14:30.349 --> 03:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
to vote against this I think the
 
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is bad I don't think we need
 
03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
to change the uh the wage payments I
 
03:14:36.670 --> 03:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
think people are pretty happy at work um
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the way things are um I think this
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
just some would say it would make it
 
03:14:42.590 --> 03:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
easier but I think it complicates the
 
03:14:44.190 --> 03:14:44.200 align:start position:0%
matter so I'm going to vote against it
 
03:14:47.229 --> 03:14:47.239 align:start position:0%

this would work if it wasn't in fact uh
 
03:14:59.469 --> 03:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
valid currency that was used and that's
 
03:15:01.950 --> 03:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
not specified actually it's crossed out
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill and remains crossed out in
 
03:15:07.150 --> 03:15:07.160 align:start position:0%

to your Amendment sir yes thank you Mr
 
03:17:41.469 --> 03:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
chair uh during the hearing on the bill
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
there were several good suggestions made
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
from committee members and I've tried to
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate them uh among them were uh
 
03:17:55.150 --> 03:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
the the change from the during the uh
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
School uh school vacation week to weeks
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
because there are a
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
couple and we also added the uh Monday
 
03:18:07.630 --> 03:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
or Friday holiday which I thought made
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
good sense and I thank the uh members
 
03:18:12.229 --> 03:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:18:16.110 --> 03:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
and clarified that is that during the
 
03:18:18.550 --> 03:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
period in which school is in session uh
 
03:18:21.030 --> 03:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
so that would be the the time that uh no
 
03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
youth 16 or 17 year old in the night
 
03:18:27.150 --> 03:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
work so I I think I've dotted all the uh
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
eyes and crossed all the tees that were
 
03:18:31.710 --> 03:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
offered so I would hope that you would
 
03:18:34.910 --> 03:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and allow uh our
 
03:18:38.070 --> 03:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
younger workers the time to uh prepare
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
for their adult work careers uh although
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
they certainly value The Experience from
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
this high school year work uh their High
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
School diploma and further education
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
will have lifelong effects and that is
 
03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
why I have brought this bill
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%

03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%

otpa for 2 37 9 representative Schultz
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do want to just
 
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
take a moment to say why I I voted no
 
03:20:56.189 --> 03:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
and it impacts the bill now is I don't
 
03:20:59.070 --> 03:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
think it goes far enough to protect uh
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
the young folks who were working I feel
 
03:21:04.590 --> 03:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
35 hours is too many hours in a school
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
week in my opinion and I think we should
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
be putting a lot more restrictions with
 
03:21:11.790 --> 03:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
parental permissions and school
 
03:21:14.590 --> 03:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
involvement all those things so I didn't
 
03:21:16.349 --> 03:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable voting for it for that
 
03:21:16.359 --> 03:21:17.229 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable voting for it for that
reason

03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:21:18.910 --> 03:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
having said that I would be fine if it
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
goes on consent I don't know where that
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
threshold is so okay thank
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
you any and I'm sorry did we get a
 
03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%

03:21:45.429 --> 03:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
bills amended I think it goes too far in
 
03:21:45.439 --> 03:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
bills amended I think it goes too far in
restricting

03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
restricting
 
03:21:51.550 --> 03:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
employers and giving the freedom and um
 
03:21:53.389 --> 03:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
choices that young people need to work
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
around their school schedules so I will
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%

chair I'm going to Echo representative
 
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
warden's thoughts uh this bill doesn't
 
03:22:07.710 --> 03:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
keep in mind homeschoolers and those who
 
03:22:09.309 --> 03:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
do not attend a typical public school
 
03:22:10.950 --> 03:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
education which is going likely going to
 
03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
be the majority in the future and uh
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
getting those kids in in a real life
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
work experience in a real life job is
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
one of the most important parts of their
 
03:22:21.870 --> 03:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
education and so I would vote against
 
03:22:24.269 --> 03:22:24.279 align:start position:0%

Amendment please yes thank you uh we
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
heard testimony uh indicating that there
 
03:26:31.150 --> 03:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
was a problem with the lack of
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
information and formed consent with the
 
03:26:34.319 --> 03:26:36.510 align:start position:0%
information and formed consent with the
um

03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:36.520 --> 03:26:39.950 align:start position:0%
um
um

03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
um sorry with the
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh what's the word I'm looking for it's
 
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
terrible uh uh any anyway nurses would
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
often work for a an agency be assigned
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
to several different places and each in
 
03:26:56.590 --> 03:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
every place they work to shift uh they
 
03:26:58.750 --> 03:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
could know they could no work not be
 
03:27:01.229 --> 03:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
hired there uh directly by the employer
 
03:27:03.469 --> 03:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
no matter how much both sides wanted it
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
without some sort of exorbitant payment
 
03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps as for as long as a year or two
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we also heard that uh there was a
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
local uh interim health agency who used
 
03:27:21.269 --> 03:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
a period of 13 weeks and after that uh
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
they were free to go so uh that seemed
 
03:27:25.950 --> 03:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
to be there seemed to be some interest
 
03:27:27.790 --> 03:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
in that some consensus that those were
 
03:27:31.590 --> 03:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
both concerns that we could address and
 
03:27:34.110 --> 03:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
U while if if this does not work I would
 
03:27:36.189 --> 03:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
hope we would retain the bill but that
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
delays the ability to to address the
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
issue and we all have uh we all have
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in our counties some there
 
03:27:46.269 --> 03:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
are sometimes correction facilities and
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
we certainly have schools and school
 
03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
nurses so this affects the whole state
 
03:27:53.950 --> 03:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see us do something uh
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
this year if at all possible and I offer
 
03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment to uh make something
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
happen thank you sir I appreciate your
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
work on putting this amendment together
 
03:28:04.429 --> 03:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz would you like to
 
03:28:05.550 --> 03:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
03:28:08.790 --> 03:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
second um I really think it's import yes
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I really think it's important
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
that we acknowledge that these
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
agreements take place as today between
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh the employer and the agencies who or
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
the agency and the employers who
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
contract with them and I think that we
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that um any employee
 
03:28:34.349 --> 03:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
uh in this situation understands the the
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
rules from the beginning about
 
03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
non-competes and I think this uh
 
03:28:40.630 --> 03:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
addresses it in a fair
 
03:28:43.030 --> 03:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
way okay representative Warden would you
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
like question for the sponsor
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
please re reading line number one of
 
03:28:53.110 --> 03:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
your Amendment it reads funny to me to
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
my reading and it says amend so and so
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
as inserted by section two of the bill
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
by replacing it with the following is
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
your Amendment designed to replace the
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
entire bill or just section two with
 
03:29:06.670 --> 03:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
this new
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
language and if and second secondarily
 
03:29:12.269 --> 03:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
do you agree that that analysis in line
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
one is
 
03:29:17.229 --> 03:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
clunky okay thank you for the question
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is intended to replace just that
 
03:29:24.389 --> 03:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
section and it shall it before the
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
letter e there should be shall not which
 
03:29:28.229 --> 03:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
I think survived in the bill and this is
 
03:29:30.150 --> 03:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
one of the unfortunate things where we
 
03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
had the amendment only and not the whole
 
03:29:34.349 --> 03:29:34.359 align:start position:0%

03:29:37.630 --> 03:29:37.640 align:start position:0%

Mr chair I I think this section of law
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
is okay as it is and I don't think that
 
03:31:21.550 --> 03:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
we need to retain it um because we can
 
03:31:24.110 --> 03:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
just put another bill in next year or
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
something thank you any other questions
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
I have one represent McKenzie good thank
 
03:31:34.870 --> 03:31:34.880 align:start position:0%

03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
the nursing field and the Staffing of
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
facilities and I Vice chair of the
 
03:31:42.990 --> 03:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County
 
03:31:45.990 --> 03:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
delegation everybody's facing issues
 
03:31:49.150 --> 03:31:49.160 align:start position:0%

03:31:49.160 --> 03:31:50.950 align:start position:0%
everybody is facing issues uh around
Staffing

03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
03:31:54.309 --> 03:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
questions I think the testimony from the
 
03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses that came before this
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee are
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
compelling to the extent that we need to
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
take a look at people who are
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners in the business Who coming
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee saying look
 
03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
we need some relief from some of these
 
03:32:13.070 --> 03:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
issues I I think we owe that to them
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
they gave very compelling testimony they
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
appr Professionals in this business they
 
03:32:21.630 --> 03:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
not only are they uh nurses but they are
 
03:32:24.670 --> 03:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
union Representatives who know what's
 
03:32:28.830 --> 03:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
going on and so I think we got to
 
03:32:31.189 --> 03:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
respond to people who come in with this
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
kind of testimony and you know nursing
 
03:32:36.670 --> 03:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
in general is is a field that's changing
 
03:32:38.070 --> 03:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
and not in a very good
 
03:32:40.590 --> 03:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
way all right thank you represent
 
03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr chair one thing I
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
also heard though was that a gentleman
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
came came in and testified that he
 
03:32:50.189 --> 03:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
strikes a business relationship with a
 
03:32:52.349 --> 03:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
county or a school district or whatever
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
the case may be
 
03:32:57.150 --> 03:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and now we want to insert
 
03:33:00.030 --> 03:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
after the fact that we don't like it
 
03:33:01.269 --> 03:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of things out there
 
03:33:03.150 --> 03:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
we don't like and yeah there's a lot of
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
things that cost more money for the
 
03:33:06.910 --> 03:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
towns and the counties and and the
 
03:33:06.920 --> 03:33:08.830 align:start position:0%
towns and the counties and and the
schools

03:33:08.830 --> 03:33:08.840 align:start position:0%

03:33:12.750 --> 03:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
03:33:15.389 --> 03:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
stupidity I I just don't get the whole
 
03:33:18.429 --> 03:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
idea of trying to usurp this Arrangement
 
03:33:20.269 --> 03:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's been made and it's made in other
 
03:33:22.990 --> 03:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
Industries too it's not just for nurses
 
03:33:25.389 --> 03:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm having a tough time with the bill
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
and there nothing personal it just that
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing practice and I just
 
03:33:33.590 --> 03:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't don't see it and representative
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
Drago I'm just going to build on what
 
03:33:38.229 --> 03:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative Flanigan said I agree uh
 
03:33:40.750 --> 03:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had a few employees call
 
03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
out so we actually had to hire an agency
 
03:33:45.389 --> 03:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
to staff us and would you know it as
 
03:33:46.590 --> 03:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
part of the paperwork we had to filled
 
03:33:47.550 --> 03:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year we had to
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
sign a non-compete we couldn't hire the
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
employee outright they had to work for
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
us for a certain amount of time
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
rightfully so that the agency can make
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
their money off us and then then we
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
could hire them so it's not unique just
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the nursing field it's I think it's
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
across the board everybody has worker
 
03:34:06.670 --> 03:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
shortage so um singling out one one
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
industry is not something I can agree
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
with okay representative kale thank you
 
03:34:16.349 --> 03:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I'd like to point now it's
 
03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding that if we filed a bill
 
03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the first year and it did not pass we
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
can't file it again in the second year
 
03:34:26.349 --> 03:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
so that means retaining is the best
 
03:34:27.870 --> 03:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
option if we actually would want to do
 
03:34:30.510 --> 03:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
something with this bill and further
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
that uh while uh there certainly are
 
03:34:36.950 --> 03:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
temp agencies uh who Supply workers and
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
and they are paid for it uh nursing is
 
03:34:43.389 --> 03:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
is is a critical part of healthc care uh
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
you can't just get anybody off the
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
street and now you're a nurse and giving
 
03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
medications and our our population is an
 
03:34:53.309 --> 03:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
aging population myself included and and
 
03:34:55.550 --> 03:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have the the be able
 
03:34:57.670 --> 03:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
to open the wards at the at the County
 
03:34:59.550 --> 03:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
nursing homes not close them because we
 
03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
can't get people or we can't afford the
 
03:35:04.030 --> 03:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
people and uh I think we need to work on
 
03:35:05.630 --> 03:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm disappointed we didn't do
 
03:35:07.830 --> 03:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment but let's go forward and
 
03:35:10.110 --> 03:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
and work on it further all right
 
03:35:12.870 --> 03:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
represent Schultz thank you Mr chair I
 
03:35:15.790 --> 03:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
think this is an issue of just basic
 
03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
oldfashioned common sense and fairness I
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
mean the situations that we heard about
 
03:35:24.510 --> 03:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
in testimony to really stick out to me
 
03:35:26.510 --> 03:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
um the first is the general thing that
 
03:35:28.990 --> 03:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
we heard over and over again which is
 
03:35:32.189 --> 03:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
these agreements aren't involving the
 
03:35:35.429 --> 03:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
employee at all these are between an
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
agency and who hires the agency which is
 
03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
a business or private entity whatever
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
the employee comes in after that and is
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
often times not even aware there is a
 
03:35:50.189 --> 03:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
non-compete Clause that will inhibit
 
03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
them from taking a job at say that
 
03:35:56.910 --> 03:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home uh for some years that
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
seems just incredibly unfair to just you
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
know if this contract that was signed
 
03:36:04.110 --> 03:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
separate from you is it presented to you
 
03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
to let you know that this is what's
 
03:36:08.229 --> 03:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
happening but the one that re the second
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
example is the one that just really
 
03:36:12.670 --> 03:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
sealed the deal for me and that was
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
someone testified that you know folks
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
don't even know they're necessarily
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
taking this interview for a job with an
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
agency they think that they're actually
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
working for say Hillsboro County Nursing
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
Home the way it's advertised to
 
03:36:33.309 --> 03:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
employees makes them believe they're
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
working for that nursing home so in what
 
03:36:39.189 --> 03:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
Universe if we don't at least find a way
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
to inform them which we could do we
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
could change the bill if we retain it in
 
03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
what Universe could we even give a
 
03:36:49.189 --> 03:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
chance for that employee who is really
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
here to pitch in and do the right thing
 
03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
and work in these jobs you know that
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be a fair way to deal with it you
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
know what I assume a reason to be
 
03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to a concept around this to be
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay with this contract situation would
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
be because you don't want poaching okay
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
you don't want poaching that I
 
03:37:13.389 --> 03:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
understand as a temp earli you know 30
 
03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
years ago I did some temp work I know
 
03:37:16.590 --> 03:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
what that's like like you know we
 
03:37:18.510 --> 03:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
definitely had limits on the laws there
 
03:37:20.469 --> 03:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
on at that point but I was I was aware
 
03:37:23.469 --> 03:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
of them you know to to not put an
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
employee in the situation to even help
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
them understand that they're not
 
03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
applying for Hillsboro County nursing
 
03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
home or that this agreement even exists
 
03:37:37.269 --> 03:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
to me seems incredibly unfair so I if
 
03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
you oppose this bill I hope you will
 
03:37:43.710 --> 03:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
seriously consider a level of fairness
 
03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
to just the average person taking these
 
03:37:48.429 --> 03:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
jobs to find a way to do the notice
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
piece because if we don't even notice
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
the workers and we lead them to believe
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
that they're working directly for that
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
nursing home and not an agency and so
 
03:37:58.950 --> 03:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it's too late I think that's
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
incredibly unfair so I agree that I
 
03:38:03.309 --> 03:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
think retaining this if you oppose the
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill would be really helpful to people
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the granite state and it might
 
03:38:09.150 --> 03:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
actually make say health care and other
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
things deeper that's my two cents thank
 
03:38:14.550 --> 03:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
you and representative Susie thank you
 
03:38:17.309 --> 03:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so I think there is a
 
03:38:20.429 --> 03:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
problem um in general overall speaking
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily with the bill but I
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
believe there's a problem and I think
 
03:38:25.469 --> 03:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
retains a good option it doesn't hurt to
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
retain it there's going to be a little
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
work to be done and at the end of the
 
03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
day if we decide that you know retaining
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
it and we can't come up with anything
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
then we voted a different way but I
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
don't think retain is a bad way to go on
 
03:38:38.429 --> 03:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
this and just take a look and see if
 
03:38:39.630 --> 03:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we can do to help
 
03:38:41.830 --> 03:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
this situation out thank you okay thank
 
03:38:44.429 --> 03:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
you and representative Granger thank you
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think the the laws of
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
Economics are important in this
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
specifically because nursing is such an
 
03:38:50.590 --> 03:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
important field and because we have a
 
03:38:52.830 --> 03:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
nursing shortage ignorance of Economics
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
is going to be all the worst if we have
 
03:38:57.550 --> 03:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
a tendency to ignore them uh there's a
 
03:38:59.389 --> 03:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
mentality in modern America where we
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
think that just because an industry is
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
important that means for that for the
 
03:39:04.349 --> 03:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
reason that it is important we can
 
03:39:06.990 --> 03:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
ignore econ but we can't it's more
 
03:39:08.429 --> 03:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
important because it's an important
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
industry to follow the laws of economics
 
03:39:12.309 --> 03:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
and if we have these non-compete
 
03:39:15.070 --> 03:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
agreements banned and or if we have come
 
03:39:16.590 --> 03:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
out with the bill and retain it and do
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
all that we're still going to be
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
ignoring the laws of economics if you
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
want to have like a notification or
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
something like that that's should be a
 
03:39:25.389 --> 03:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
separate bill it shouldn't be part of
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and I don't think even if this
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
Bill gets indefinitely postponed on the
 
03:39:30.910 --> 03:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
floor I don't think anyone would be say
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
that uh a notice to an
 
03:39:35.550 --> 03:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
employee that there's a non-compete
 
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
agreement is is the same thing as the
 
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
last bill so I think it would be
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine to file it next year and
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
representive Flanigan thank you Mr
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
chairman on a similar note not that I'll
 
03:39:48.309 --> 03:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
say I say the same thing as my sidekick
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
here but to representative Schultz's
 
03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
concern is the bill if it is to itl it
 
03:39:59.189 --> 03:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
can be brought back though similar to
 
03:40:01.030 --> 03:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
what representative Susi was commenting
 
03:40:03.150 --> 03:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
about was it uh
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
sharing to the prospective nurse or
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
whatever employee is that there is a
 
03:40:11.070 --> 03:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
relationship with the the location where
 
03:40:14.070 --> 03:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
you'll be working at and that you you
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
cannot just leave us and go work for
 
03:40:18.750 --> 03:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
them there's a process in place if that
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
bill was submitted I don't see there'd
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
be a conflict between this bill in in
 
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
something Bill like that because they're
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with two separate issues
 
03:40:29.429 --> 03:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
one's the new one one would be this a
 
03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
notification whereas this is basically
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
saying you can't do it as an agency so
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's a two different things but it does
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
the goal I think that the sponsor wanted
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
was to make sure the person knows that
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
you can't just take a job unilaterally
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
now maybe that's the case but I I I
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
think with the agreements that we have
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
and uh it creates problems but that that
 
03:40:54.030 --> 03:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
can be resubmitted next term represent
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
kill Mr chair I I again that would be to
 
03:40:59.630 --> 03:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
my my friend Mr Frank and that would be
 
03:41:02.189 --> 03:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
up to the speaker to decide but I wanted
 
03:41:05.229 --> 03:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
to add that we did hear from a gentleman
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
who I said I believe he had over 40
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
years experience in this business and he
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
has relationships with the with the
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
facilities and with the the uh people
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
that he calls upon and it seems to be
 
03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
working with just 13 weeks of uh
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
recouping his expenses and making a
 
03:41:26.189 --> 03:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
profit otherwise he wouldn't be doing it
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
for I think it was 43 years so I I think
 
03:41:32.590 --> 03:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
this was not saying you can't have a a
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
non-compete it just says the length of
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
time for which you can have it uh 13
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
weeks as opposed to 52 weeks or some you
 
03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
know there's there's no limit right now
 
03:41:46.990 --> 03:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
so so I think again I think we should
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
retain it and do some additional work uh
 
03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
thinking of our of our districts uh the
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
people that we serve uh this could be
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
helpful representa
 
03:42:01.469 --> 03:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
lebrin thank you Mr chair just to sum
 
03:42:03.229 --> 03:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
this up I think and we've hired
 
03:42:05.070 --> 03:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
temporary workers too and when we go to
 
03:42:08.149 --> 03:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
ATT temp service we know how it works
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
the workers know how it works everybody
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
knows how it works so to to put on this
 
03:42:17.309 --> 03:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
charade that we don't know how it works
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
charade and and I don't know that we
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
should retain this I think it needs to
 
03:42:23.229 --> 03:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
be gutted and brought back as something
 
03:42:25.469 --> 03:42:25.479 align:start position:0%
else if there's truly a problem I think
 
03:42:27.870 --> 03:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
it needs to be we need to dive into it
 
03:42:29.630 --> 03:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
deeper this is not the build to solve
 
03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
deeper this is not the build to solve
the

03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
problem represent
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
McKenzie let me um let me repeat
 
03:42:45.550 --> 03:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
this in in nursing homes and and agen
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
all over the the state and County
 
03:42:51.950 --> 03:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
government there is this issue and
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
Staffing uh agencies are an
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
issue uh they cost more money they
 
03:43:03.149 --> 03:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
displace workers uh so we need to figure
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
this out I think somebody comes to us
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
and says we have this problem we need
 
03:43:11.189 --> 03:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
this committee which is the charge that
 
03:43:14.590 --> 03:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
we have to look at issues around
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
Staffing of uh and how Staffing works
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
and whether or not this is impeding uh
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
people's rights and but more importantly
 
03:43:25.830 --> 03:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
what kind of impact is this having
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
generally on the workforce and the
 
03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
nursing profession uh is one of the the
 
03:43:36.189 --> 03:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
places where there are shortages where
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
the Boston hospitals are just pulling
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
them out of the state of New Hampshire
 
03:43:43.149 --> 03:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
and so if somebody comes to us and said
 
03:43:45.429 --> 03:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
will you take a look at this I I think
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
we should take some time we we don't
 
03:43:50.149 --> 03:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
have a lot backed up here to take some
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
time to really to go through this and
 
03:43:55.630 --> 03:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
try to understand uh how these pieces
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
fit together in the broader question
 
03:44:00.070 --> 03:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
about uh the impact is this having on
 
03:44:02.830 --> 03:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
the on the on the business so I would
 
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
legislation right um
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
all good
 
03:44:20.910 --> 03:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
points I think we should listen to it uh
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
I do believe that the opport I do
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
believe that as I read the bill that we
 
03:44:25.950 --> 03:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
missed the
 
03:44:28.830 --> 03:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
mark and and what I would rather see is
 
03:44:32.149 --> 03:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
coming in with uh a more specific thing
 
03:44:34.590 --> 03:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
related to the agency versus the
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
employee uh next year with a separate
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
03:44:42.189 --> 03:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh I just listen to everyone and having
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
read through it that that's sort of
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming out on it
 
03:44:49.070 --> 03:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
um any other comments seeing none Mr
 
03:44:50.910 --> 03:44:50.920 align:start position:0%

119 all right the motion to retain uh
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
sales at 11:
 
03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
to9 uh we back to our original motion Mr
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
motion are we ready for a new
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
motion yes well I think so no do bear
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
with me here do we vote on our to
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
pass that was the original motion was
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and then the amendment and
 
03:46:15.790 --> 03:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
then a subsequent retain
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
original motion is to pass rain I
 
03:46:20.149 --> 03:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
believe that the process is the
 
03:46:22.149 --> 03:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
amendment is offered then you make a
 
03:46:24.510 --> 03:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
motion to ought to pass as amended or
 
03:46:26.110 --> 03:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
you make a motion to itl or an
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
alternative motion I do not believe the
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
original original motion when you're are
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
trying to amend the bill is ought to
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
pass as amended because you haven't
 
03:46:33.309 --> 03:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
adopted the amendment yet no no no the
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
original motion was ought to
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
pass then Amendment failed the amendment
 
03:46:42.189 --> 03:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
failed right but no mo mo but so you
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
make a motion to amend and then if you
 
03:46:46.590 --> 03:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
want so if you want the motion to amend
 
03:46:48.670 --> 03:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
to pass and you voted on that that's one
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
thing but you can't vote to pass as
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
amended unless noal motion was ought to
 
03:46:57.309 --> 03:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
pass not ought to pass as
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
amended the the motion to ought to pass
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
as amend it was never made because we
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
did not pass the amendment but in order
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
to vote on an amendment we need to vote
 
03:47:08.269 --> 03:47:08.279 align:start position:0%
on whether or not you need to make a
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
03:47:13.269 --> 03:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
amend we did and we and it failed 119
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
right so now we don't now we up to New
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
motion you can make the the motion of
 
03:47:18.389 --> 03:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
ought to pass doesn't outrank the motion
 
03:47:18.399 --> 03:47:19.710 align:start position:0%
ought to pass doesn't outrank the motion
of

03:47:19.710 --> 03:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:47:22.110 --> 03:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
itl except that theemotion to ought to
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
pass was never voted on but with the
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
motion was to amend not a motion of
 
03:47:28.149 --> 03:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
03:47:30.189 --> 03:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
pass I the process that we've been
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
following in this in this executive
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
session just seems strange to me okay it
 
03:47:37.550 --> 03:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's not strange to me okay so we're
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to vote on a the pass and then if
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
that passes or fails then we'll make a
 
03:47:46.110 --> 03:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
new motion I did disagree cuz he made a
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
motion the excuse me the representative
 
03:47:50.830 --> 03:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
made a motion to retain correct that
 
03:47:53.309 --> 03:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
failed now we can entertain a new motion
 
03:47:55.349 --> 03:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
which I'd like to
 
03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
move it's not OTP doesn't hang out there
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
until we vote against it retain was a a
 
03:48:03.309 --> 03:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
valid motion and it died and it failed
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
and now it failed now the bill is open
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
for a new motion as far as I'm concerned
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
unless somebody can prove me wrong
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
you're right yeah you're right
 
03:48:16.189 --> 03:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to move to legislate on

representative kill thank you
 
03:51:24.710 --> 03:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
sir yeah I have to WR Mr chair I have a
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
point of order point of order sir so the
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh the chair as I understand it has the
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
authority and if somebody disagrees with
 
03:51:38.469 --> 03:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
the chair they can challenge the
 
03:51:41.070 --> 03:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
decision of the chair and call for a
 
03:51:43.429 --> 03:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
challenge what we just witnessed there
 
03:51:45.510 --> 03:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
quite frankly where a member of the
 
03:51:49.990 --> 03:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee was was challenging you uh on
 
03:51:52.710 --> 03:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
on on your decision I think was
 
03:51:55.229 --> 03:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and I think it I think it
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
violates the rules in the sense that you
 
03:51:59.550 --> 03:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
have they have a responsibility to
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
challenge you and there is a process
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
whereby they challenge a chair so I just
 
03:52:04.990 --> 03:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
want to object to what just happened
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
here uh as much as we may not agree with
 
03:52:10.149 --> 03:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
you from time to time you're still the
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee and you have the
 
03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
authority to make these decisions thanks
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%

03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%

would like to present Amendment um
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
0459 which is an amendment to House Bill
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
487 um which is a um a bill to require
 
03:55:08.830 --> 03:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
employers to provide schedules a week in
 
03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
advance so that people can plan their
 
03:55:14.070 --> 03:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
schedules um based on the information
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
that we heard during the hearing there
 
03:55:19.149 --> 03:55:19.159 align:start position:0%
are some
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
um some positions some jobs that just
 
03:55:24.790 --> 03:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
don't fit into a regular schedule and
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to passed it
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
would have created a lot of unintended
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
consequences so the bill has been
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
narrowed um if you look at um lines 8
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
and 19 18 and 19 it has been um reduced
 
03:55:44.349 --> 03:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
to apply just to um people in the um
 
03:55:44.359 --> 03:55:45.790 align:start position:0%
to apply just to um people in the um
hospitality

03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
hospitality
 
03:55:50.189 --> 03:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
industry and it um requires um
 
03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
notification um at least s days in
 
03:55:55.750 --> 03:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
advance of any scheduled shift and that
 
03:55:57.870 --> 03:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
would be the starting time of the shift
 
03:56:00.269 --> 03:56:00.279 align:start position:0%
because there was some confusion about
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know how long the shifts were going
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
and it also changes um section two um
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
requirements of this section shall not
 
03:56:11.389 --> 03:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
apply when um Regular operations of the
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
employee are suspended during
 
03:56:15.309 --> 03:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances beyond the employer's
 
03:56:17.870 --> 03:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
control such as extreme weather
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
earthquakes um also it would allow for
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
um employers to call people in um on
 
03:56:29.950 --> 03:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
short notice if um three buses full of
 
03:56:32.030 --> 03:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
leaf peers show up at the business and
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
they need extra people to come on so
 
03:56:36.389 --> 03:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
those are the changes that have been
 
03:56:39.870 --> 03:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
made uh to this um a bill and this is
 
03:56:42.030 --> 03:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I'm offering thank
 
03:56:43.950 --> 03:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
you all right and representive schz
 
03:56:46.189 --> 03:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
would you like like to talk to your to
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
your second no Mr chair she did a great
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
job okay and are there any other
 
03:56:54.269 --> 03:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
amendment representa lb thank you Mr
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
chair I think with the amendment we have
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
still continue to miss the mark on this
 
03:57:05.830 --> 03:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
we have hotels restaurants cafes I saw
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
something on Channel 9 in the middle of
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
the snowstorm we just had there was a
 
03:57:11.149 --> 03:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
guy in your neck of the woods in antrum
 
03:57:13.269 --> 03:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
that stayed open and I just don't know
 
03:57:15.149 --> 03:57:15.159 align:start position:0%
how you're going to staff that or not
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
staff it with weather so I mean if you
 
03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
want to have this type of law go into
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
effect maybe it would work in a hospital
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
where it's guaranteed or the fire
 
03:57:28.229 --> 03:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
department or the police department but
 
03:57:30.030 --> 03:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
in any of these that are listed here
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's too much there's too much VAR
 
03:57:34.510 --> 03:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
variability going on here so I'm not for
 
03:57:36.990 --> 03:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
this all right now are there any other
 
03:57:39.550 --> 03:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
comments on this
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
amendment suing seeing yes represent
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
Schultz forgive me if I didn't
 
03:57:47.710 --> 03:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly but the section
 
03:57:51.070 --> 03:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
on weather here is actually excluding
 
03:57:51.080 --> 03:57:52.389 align:start position:0%
on weather here is actually excluding
those

03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
situations it's saying that you know in
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
events of of such of extreme weather and
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
acts of God basically um not mandating
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
that it's removing that as a contingency
 
03:58:08.309 --> 03:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
I think to meet what you were
 
03:58:10.630 --> 03:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
saying represent wrong on that I'm not
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
sure representative Bri do you have a
 
03:58:14.910 --> 03:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair um and I
 
03:58:16.349 --> 03:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
won't go back and forth on this I would
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
just state that I understand that I
 
03:58:21.149 --> 03:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I just look at the the the
 
03:58:23.149 --> 03:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
um businesses that are labeled here and
 
03:58:24.830 --> 03:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
the question would be who then is the
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
judge jury and executioner on this in
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
terms of how does it qualify at the end
 
03:58:32.349 --> 03:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
of the day right thank
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
you further
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions R M K thank you Mr shair just
 
03:58:41.950 --> 03:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
a comment really I I while I sympathize
 
03:58:44.830 --> 03:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
that things can be unti ipated in the
 
03:58:47.469 --> 03:58:47.479 align:start position:0%
restaurant world and hotels and such but
 
03:58:50.590 --> 03:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
I do think if uh if the owners of those
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
businesses were a bit more conscious of
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of their employees
 
03:58:59.389 --> 03:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
that maybe they would make the effort to
 
03:59:01.469 --> 03:59:01.479 align:start position:0%
prepare a schedule and tell them a
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
little bit ahead of time so that we
 
03:59:06.349 --> 03:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be looking at bills like this
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I just don't think it's
 
03:59:09.670 --> 03:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
unmanageable I think it could be done
 
03:59:10.750 --> 03:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
there are probably quite a few
 
03:59:12.910 --> 03:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants that say you know these are
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
the days that you work and those are the
 
03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
days that someone else Works uh and and
 
03:59:21.309 --> 03:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
it uh it probably works out fine but uh
 
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to be the prevalence
 
03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
in the industry and that's why we heard
 
03:59:28.269 --> 03:59:28.279 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the sponsor and from
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
her constituent who was trying to uh
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
work for a living and finding it
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
difficult because of this uh
 
03:59:38.309 --> 03:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
unanticipated schedule you I'm working
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at 5 5: a.m. uh now you tell me
 
03:59:43.269 --> 03:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
not that she doesn't want to work but
 
03:59:45.389 --> 03:59:45.399 align:start position:0%
she like to know when she's going to
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you

04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
and this closes
 
04:04:04.910 --> 04:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
487 all right and i' now like to open
 
04:04:14.030 --> 04:04:14.040 align:start position:0%

Amendment
202-02

04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
52h and would you like to speak to your
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment information yes please Mr

chairman can you repeat that motion
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
again well is I well it's let me just
 
04:04:41.630 --> 04:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
say I I think it's inappropriate because
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
this came up in another bill it was CA
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
confusion when the very original motion
 
04:04:48.510 --> 04:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass as amended no you
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct stand by stand by
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
so your motion is ought to pass you'd
 
04:04:55.950 --> 04:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
like to introduce an
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we'll vote on the
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
amendment so the uh it'll be uh ought to
 
04:05:05.630 --> 04:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
pass and
 
04:05:05.640 --> 04:05:07.469 align:start position:0%
pass and
second

04:05:07.469 --> 04:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
and representative L cler you uh second
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
a motion yes okay now can you speak to
 
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
your Amendment Place sure uh so this is
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
25252 so we have an opportunity here
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
to improve the unemployment
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
system which is badly
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
needed we have lagged behind for more
 
04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
than 20 years in terms of increasing the
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate for workers in New
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is is the time when we
 
04:05:48.510 --> 04:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
have the lowest employer rate in 30
 
04:05:51.750 --> 04:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
years where we have a fund that's that's
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
not quite 400 million but it's climbing
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
up it's about 380 somewhat million
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
dollars so the employers have one more
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
Notch to go which they probably won't
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
get to which is the 400 million Mark but
 
04:06:08.429 --> 04:06:08.439 align:start position:0%
for the most part uh it's a lowest rate
 
04:06:10.389 --> 04:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
they've had in 30 years and the fund is
 
04:06:13.030 --> 04:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the best shape has been in many many
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
years a high highest
 
04:06:17.790 --> 04:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
level what this bill does is to take an
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
increase six
 
04:06:23.550 --> 04:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
steps so it brings it to uh
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
515 and let me say the the impact of
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
that particular uh legislation
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
has so right now you hit the top when
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
you hit four
 
04:06:39.309 --> 04:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
$41,500 you hit the
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
top for that you get um you get 400 you
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
get $427 and you hit the top of the
 
04:06:51.070 --> 04:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
scale the people in
 
04:06:54.429 --> 04:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
2003 the claimants qualifying for
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.630 --> 04:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
86,5 in
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
2003 that's a
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
26% wage replacement rate in contrast to
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
the lower end of scale which is which
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
has a
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
54% replacement rate
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
if you go to the following year uh it
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
885636 replacement rate what this
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
particular legislation will do will be
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
to move up that scale and close the gap
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
on that uh on that
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
50% or 50 2% which is really the target
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
to close the gap on that and the the
 
04:07:52.269 --> 04:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
important thing to note about this is
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
because the balance is what it is in the
 
04:07:56.830 --> 04:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
fund and I think it's a three I I think
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
after this goes through would be
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
362 but the trigger at $350 million will
 
04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
not be affected at all so this is not
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to raise the employer's rate it'll
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
stay the same all the triggers will be
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
in place
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
now you heard a couple of things about
 
04:08:16.439 --> 04:08:17.710 align:start position:0%
now you heard a couple of things about
mild

04:08:17.710 --> 04:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
mild
 
04:08:20.830 --> 04:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
recession uh uh there's two things that
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
they they call myor recession and major
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
recession and they are
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
forecast there is no guarantee that
 
04:08:31.149 --> 04:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
would happen uh but they have an
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
obligation uh as the UI uh uh has stated
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
to give you what could potentially be
 
04:08:41.870 --> 04:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
and could potentially happen in the
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
economy in the years to come so it's the
 
04:08:48.429 --> 04:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
best guess it's it's not un it's not
 
04:08:51.550 --> 04:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
it's informed but it's the best guess in
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
that case it would potentially increase
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
the rate uh
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
22 uh by $22 million if that if that
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
were to happen but the interesting thing
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
about that is that even under the worst
 
04:09:10.830 --> 04:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
recession the major recession the fund
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
itself does not go into the negative it
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
stays within that range that the pment
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
employment security said because at the
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
end would be the trust fund would finish
 
04:09:26.590 --> 04:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
at $242 million so there is no borrowing
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
from the federal the federal government
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh the fund still has a has $242 million
 
04:09:36.109 --> 04:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
under the worst case
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
scenario so in all the years I've been
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
doing unemployment insurance work uh and
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
I was on the advisor Council for years
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
i' I've never quite seen this come
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
together the way it is and it is our
 
04:09:53.109 --> 04:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
best opportunity to contribute to
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
people's lives in a way that's
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful and to allow them to have
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
some more money this is not a ton of
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
money but it helps each and every person
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
and you and you notice in the
 
04:10:09.750 --> 04:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
analysis there were 6,000 people had
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
this been in place that would have got
 
04:10:14.830 --> 04:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
this uh just for for the the past for
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
2003 and more so 6,200 62,000 people
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
would have got it in
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
2024 this is impactful it's something
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
that we can do it's not going to hurt
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
the employers it's not going to break
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
the fund and it's reasonable uh to move
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
in this direction at this time because
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
of the way that this has aligned and Mr
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
chairman I would urge this committee
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
this is good work and this is a good
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
thing to do for each and every one of
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
your people who are in who are
 
04:10:47.070 --> 04:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
unemployed and they're I looked at the
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
statistic there's not one place of
 
04:10:52.109 --> 04:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
that's represented in this room that
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have unemployed workers so you
 
04:10:56.830 --> 04:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
got to think about when you bang into
 
04:10:58.950 --> 04:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
this person in the bank or you hit them
 
04:11:00.990 --> 04:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
in the supermarket you got to look them
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the eye and say we had a chance to
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
increase your unemployment benefits and
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
we turned it down it's not fair this is
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
not unreasonable and it's not
 
04:11:12.189 --> 04:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
extravagant in any way it's only
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
bringing that up few dollars and I think
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is the best time that we can do it
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I urge this committee uh to
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
please bring that rate up to
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
52,000 and give workers
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
$535 for the maximum benefit please do
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
this thank you sir for your Amendment
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative L do you have a comment
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
to your second uh yes please just just
 
04:11:40.349 --> 04:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
obviously echoing everything that um my
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
seatmate here
 
04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
described for another $108 a week you
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
know that doesn't sound like a ton of
 
04:11:49.229 --> 04:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
money but $400 a month you know whatever
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
that that could really uh help a lot of
 
04:11:54.910 --> 04:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
people out so I agree with I agree with
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment thank you okay thank you
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
and represent Susie thank you Mr
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I agree with my colleagues as
 
04:12:04.830 --> 04:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
well I also sat on the advisory Council
 
04:12:06.510 --> 04:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
for two years when we were in the
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
majority um and I look back and I look
 
04:12:11.590 --> 04:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
at the what the fund balance is right
 
04:12:14.710 --> 04:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
now and I look at at the fact that it
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't been raised in years and I would
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
ask everyone in this room to look at
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
things that haven't been raised in years
 
04:12:22.910 --> 04:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
I mean if we go back if it hasn't been
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
raised in 10 years tell me what hasn't
 
04:12:27.389 --> 04:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
been raised in 10 years in today's
 
04:12:29.469 --> 04:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
society everything's been raised
 
04:12:31.149 --> 04:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
everything been been raised but
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation so I think
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's time um I think Mark brought did
 
04:12:40.590 --> 04:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
some good work on this and um I think
 
04:12:45.149 --> 04:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative Granger and then
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative Leb uh parliamentary
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
inquiry so when we vote on this we're
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to be when we call the role we're
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
calling a role on the amendment just the
 
04:12:55.870 --> 04:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
amendment only the amendment we got to
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
approve that first thank you
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative Le thank you Mr chair and
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
if I could ask representative McKenzie a
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
question yes please um representative
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned to me that you know
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
currently it's 427 and I have some
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
seasonal employees if I wanted to pay
 
04:13:11.830 --> 04:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
out of pocket to give these guys a boost
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know instead of bringing this to 52
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
3 or whatever it was could I then give
 
04:13:17.550 --> 04:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
them a boost where they wouldn't have to
 
04:13:20.189 --> 04:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
have this ding there unemployment and
 
04:13:22.990 --> 04:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
could I do that would it be 30% could I
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
as an employer offset this from a
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
seasonal employee perspective I I think
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
that the the way the law reads is that
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
an employee can make 30% more than their
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits that was before
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
this committee a couple years ago in
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
pass for a followup so I could
 
04:13:41.630 --> 04:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
personally shoulder the
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
load in that case if I wanted
 
04:13:47.910 --> 04:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
to I I assume you could okay I just
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to check thank
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
you all
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
right Mr chairman I got one more point
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
stand by representative
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
K yeah excuse me Mr chair I I think
 
04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps my friend Mr McKenzie may have
 
04:14:04.269 --> 04:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
under Mis misunderstood the question
 
04:14:07.149 --> 04:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
that my other friend Mr lry was asking I
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
okay I I think if I think they're
 
04:14:10.510 --> 04:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
looking the employment office is looking
 
04:14:12.510 --> 04:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
at your wages and unless they're going
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
to give his going to give another 30%
 
04:14:16.590 --> 04:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
under the table which we're not sure is
 
04:14:18.670 --> 04:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
legal I I don't think that would be
 
04:14:21.389 --> 04:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
advisable for him to shoulder the load
 
04:14:23.070 --> 04:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
as much as much as a nice gesture it
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
would be if I understood what what he
 
04:14:26.349 --> 04:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
was getting
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
to okay and represent
 
04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I I I do just want to um and I
 
04:14:35.429 --> 04:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
we probably can speak to the broader
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
when this in the
 
04:14:38.830 --> 04:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
amendment but there was raised during
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
the course of the hearing the question
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this would cause
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
people to stay
 
04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
home um and I think there's some
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
evidence that that
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
showed that maybe when when this rate
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
goes up that that may tick up a bit but
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
let me say what that does is it gives
 
04:15:01.469 --> 04:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
people more time to make the
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
adjustment it's you know I've never been
 
04:15:06.189 --> 04:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
laid off I don't know what that's like
 
04:15:08.790 --> 04:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
I've never been laid off but for those
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
people who are that are trying to
 
04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
transition we'll say one careator to the
 
04:15:12.680 --> 04:15:13.870 align:start position:0%
transition we'll say one careator to the
next

04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:15:15.870 --> 04:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
giving people a couple of extra weeks to
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
make that transition and certainly we're
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
well within the range of the 26 weeks
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
gives them that additional opportunity
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
and and to be honest I don't I listen to
 
04:15:27.720 --> 04:15:28.630 align:start position:0%
and and to be honest I don't I listen to
the

04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
Unemployment uh people at the UI uh
 
04:15:33.990 --> 04:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee advisory committee they have a
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
pretty hefty legal
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
department so if you're found to be
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
sitting around and you're not complying
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the with the rules uh looking for
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
work and filing the paperwork and you
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
got to file two or three uh contacts
 
04:15:51.070 --> 04:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
week then you're going to get you're
 
04:15:53.469 --> 04:15:53.479 align:start position:0%
going to lose the benefits so this gives
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
people a couple of more weeks perhaps a
 
04:15:59.670 --> 04:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
little more L room to do that and I and
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
I hope that that doesn't become the
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
thing that deters people from from
 
04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this important
 
04:16:08.149 --> 04:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:16:09.429 --> 04:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
representative lbre did you have a
 
04:16:11.070 --> 04:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
comment you good representative
 
04:16:13.510 --> 04:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
Mackenzie or kale please
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to add that this this
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
extra fund while we well I think Mr
 
04:16:20.149 --> 04:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
labor has also assured us that this
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't likely to trigger a a lot of uh
 
04:16:25.389 --> 04:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
abuse of the system I think what we
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
should know about what it does and if
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
you're someone who's earnings this much
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
money and now you're getting this much
 
04:16:35.149 --> 04:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
money through no fault of your own
 
04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
you're looking for work you're trying to
 
04:16:38.590 --> 04:16:38.600 align:start position:0%

necessary is that could we could we
 
04:16:54.630 --> 04:16:54.640 align:start position:0%

04:16:56.269 --> 04:16:56.279 align:start position:0%

04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
a hundred years in the experience
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
experiment of having a welfare state
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's sort of turning into a welfare
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
trampoline and it's good thing it's good
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
thing have a safety net like a lot of
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
people think that it's important to have
 
04:18:46.990 --> 04:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
a safety net however I don't think that
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's good for the soul of a country to
 
04:18:52.149 --> 04:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
just have private charity churches and
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
all the other organizations in society
 
04:18:55.389 --> 04:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
crowded out by the government coming in
 
04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
and saying you can only survive when
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
you're unemployed through us because
 
04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
we've put the churches out of business
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
we've put the Charities out of business
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
we need to get back to starting to
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
respect each other in our communities
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
and taking care of our friends and
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
taking care of our neighbors and taking
 
04:19:10.030 --> 04:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
care of our communities rather than
 
04:19:11.790 --> 04:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
relying on the welfare state to bail us
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
out every time uh it's very bad not just
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the P not just for society as a
 
04:19:18.510 --> 04:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
whole to have this it's for the person
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
receiving the handout it's it's attacks
 
04:19:23.309 --> 04:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
on their soul it really it it's it
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
really just degrades the existence of
 
04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
their being they're no longer receiving
 
04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
charity they're no longer receiving a
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
gift given from the kindness of their
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
hearts they're getting some money that
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
was coercively taken away from a
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
business against the will of the
 
04:19:37.149 --> 04:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
business holder they're receiving stolen
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
funds and we've had a 100-year experient
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
with this and we've seen the results we
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
are not the same people that we were 100
 
04:19:46.990 --> 04:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
years ago we were better 100 years ago
 
04:19:48.750 --> 04:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
we were more moral we were more Pious we
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
were more righteous people 100 years ago
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
and we in order to get back to that in
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
order to undo a lot of the terrible
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
things we've seen done in the 20th
 
04:19:59.550 --> 04:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
century we need to start saying no take
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
care of each other correctly instead of
 
04:20:03.870 --> 04:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
doing it through coercion and force and
 
04:20:06.510 --> 04:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
violence thank you thank you for your
 
04:20:08.429 --> 04:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
04:20:12.990 --> 04:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
McKenzie waves off thank you um oh you
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
don't wave
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
off I'm composing myself thank
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
you so I I I think uh to suggest that
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
unemployed workers are in some way uh on
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
the do that they aren't
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
deserving uh of of the system uh of
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
wages that come out of a system that is
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
jointly uh that employers buy into they
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
spend the money for it they understand
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
how important it is to have a
 
04:20:50.429 --> 04:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh to M to maintain a
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce to support
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
them do away with that let me tell you
 
04:20:58.349 --> 04:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
the the experience I have with Berlin
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where I got the call from
 
04:21:04.189 --> 04:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
Governor Shaheen that they closed the
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
plant when you had four five 6,000
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
people out of work in one area of the
 
04:21:11.560 --> 04:21:13.149 align:start position:0%
people out of work in one area of the
state

04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:21:15.309 --> 04:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
had it not been for unemployment these
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
were people who worked that tailes off
 
04:21:20.189 --> 04:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
for 30 years in a
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
mill these people weren't looking for a
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
handout they were looking for somebody
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
to help stabilize their lives for that
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
period of time and that's what
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment does it helps people to
 
04:21:34.750 --> 04:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
stabilize their lives had that not been
 
04:21:37.510 --> 04:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
in place during the time that Mill
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
closed it would have been a disaster in
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
Berlin New Hampshire an absolute
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
disaster F people wouldn't have the
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
money to eat they wouldn't have the
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
money to drive they wouldn't have the
 
04:21:49.109 --> 04:21:49.119 align:start position:0%
money to do anything quite frankly in a
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
place like Berlin New Hampshire so the
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
idea that these people are somehow
 
04:21:55.950 --> 04:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the system that
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
somehow this makes that this is not a
 
04:22:02.349 --> 04:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
legitimate uh uh uh system of benefits
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
to people is is offensive to me in a
 
04:22:07.469 --> 04:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
whole lot of ways these people are not
 
04:22:10.109 --> 04:22:10.119 align:start position:0%
looking for hands out this is a system
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
that works and it has worked for many
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
many years is since the 40s and I
 
04:22:17.149 --> 04:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely think it's the right thing to
 
04:22:20.189 --> 04:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
do to pass this amendment thank you Mr
 
04:22:22.630 --> 04:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your comment
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr chair
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
um as uh Mr McKenzie so aely uh spoke uh
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
this is a system of insurance and I know
 
04:22:36.910 --> 04:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
that Mr Granger wants to privatized this
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
insurance but we haven't had any takers
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
for $85 a year for the the average
 
04:22:42.119 --> 04:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
for $85 a year for the the average
premium

04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
premium
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh and if the employer doesn't lay off
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
people uh that's about where it
 
04:22:52.830 --> 04:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
stays and for the employee to come out
 
04:22:54.750 --> 04:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
with not enough you
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
know what is it 26% of their income and
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
try to survive on that uh when they're
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
laid off not because they're taking a
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
break from work not because they were
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
laid off something happened and now
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
they're out of work the work that they
 
04:23:09.389 --> 04:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
prepared for the work that they did
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
where they were earning you know
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
substantially more than the unemployment
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
check will provide to say that they are
 
04:23:18.870 --> 04:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh they're being diminished their soul
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
is suffering and all this
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
drama and and it's and I mean also I'm
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
going to mention that the Charities
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
there are Charities thriving in in this
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
state because we're giving them gambling
 
04:23:33.149 --> 04:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
money we're encouraging people to go out
 
04:23:35.309 --> 04:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
and take that small paycheck or that
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment check cash it in and bring
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
it in and play a try sports betting to
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
see if they can make a living and and I
 
04:23:45.670 --> 04:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
I wonder if if the the representative
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
Granger is Allin for that uh damage to
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
the economy and damage to people's
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
Souls uh I think we need to make this
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
adjustment and we should pass this pass
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment the bill as amended and I
 
04:24:00.269 --> 04:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
hope that the majority of the committee
 
04:24:02.349 --> 04:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
will agree and if not we'll take it to
 
04:24:02.359 --> 04:24:04.630 align:start position:0%
will agree and if not we'll take it to
the

04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
floor right seeing no further comments
 
04:24:09.550 --> 04:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
actually seeing one further comment
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz thank you Mr
 
04:24:13.229 --> 04:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
chair I wait and bance whether or not to
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
say this and I'm going to go in a
 
04:24:17.109 --> 04:24:17.119 align:start position:0%
positive direction to thank you I
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%

04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
folks who shared your views were that
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
blatantly honest about it because I
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
think it helps us all clarify our values
 
04:24:28.389 --> 04:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
regardless I you probably don't think
 
04:24:30.030 --> 04:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
I'm being sincere I really do appreciate
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
it um and I would like to extend the
 
04:24:34.630 --> 04:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
hand to say if you'd like to work with
 
04:24:37.710 --> 04:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
me on reducing corporate welfare I would
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
love to do that um I'll also as a
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
footnote say we are the least Church
 
04:24:44.790 --> 04:24:44.800 align:start position:0%

assistance once one-time rent assistance
 
04:24:57.309 --> 04:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
and we unfortunately don't have that
 
04:24:59.790 --> 04:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
safety net from the private sector to
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
take care of uh that at all just for
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that's worth but ask your own
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%

04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
being one that I'm just sitting in on
 
04:25:21.149 --> 04:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
this uh this committee is uh the
 
04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
personal attacks against uh
 
04:25:25.630 --> 04:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
representative Granger for his
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
beliefs uh not withstanding young lady
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
sitting next to me the
 
04:25:34.349 --> 04:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh you know unemployment
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
is a safety net it's not the it's not
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
the end
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
all and I think what repres
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative Granger stated is
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct we have lost our
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
moral compass in a lot of ways in this
 
04:25:50.910 --> 04:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
country and that's the reason we're in
 
04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state of this repair that we are in
 
04:25:58.030 --> 04:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
take us aid for example $55 million for
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
Condoms To Hamas or the Taliban I mean
 
04:26:04.349 --> 04:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
hor that that money wasn't going
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
for Condoms we all know it's going to go
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
for so the focus right now is ought to
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%

to your
Amendment

04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
sure um so as I mentioned in the public
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
hearing the workers compensation system
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
has over the past 20 plus years uh maybe
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
even longer than that now actually I've
 
04:31:57.750 --> 04:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
gone through a whole cycle of changes
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
that have not necessarily benefited the
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
workers and it's been driven primarily
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
um by
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
cost um so we have become
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
the worker in the
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
system has become
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
um the way that they control the cost is
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
by raking back raking back the benefits
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
66 and
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
2/3 is to
 
04:32:29.309 --> 04:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
restore uh a benefit that we had prior
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
to passage of
 
04:32:35.070 --> 04:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
1409 uh back in
 
04:32:38.349 --> 04:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
1993 so this restores
 
04:32:43.229 --> 04:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
that but it is um only one of of a
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
number of things that I think should
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
change and today there is what was
 
04:32:54.269 --> 04:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
that today there is uh about 100
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
carriers in the market 100 people
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
writing this business from what we
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
understood from the insurance uh group
 
04:33:05.070 --> 04:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
and and the market is in much better
 
04:33:06.750 --> 04:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
shape than it ever was certainly it's in
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
better shape than we when we started
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
through these
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
reforms so at what point does a good
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
Market that's making money at what point
 
04:33:19.551 --> 04:33:19.561 align:start position:0%
do we start looking at the workers uh in
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
the system to say okay we restored the
 
04:33:26.910 --> 04:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
system it's back on uh it's back on a
 
04:33:29.070 --> 04:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
good track and now it's time to maybe
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
look at some of those benefits and
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what this thing does
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
I I would be here as I said a couple of
 
04:33:38.109 --> 04:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
days trying to explain all the changes
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
had occurred in the course of this of
 
04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
this year these years
 
04:33:44.189 --> 04:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
um but they were
 
04:33:47.789 --> 04:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
significant very significant to working
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
people and this was one of them and we
 
04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
are the outlier one of the outliers in
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
the United States that has a 60%
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
rate and there is room to be able to
 
04:34:04.349 --> 04:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
increase this
 
04:34:08.470 --> 04:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
rate and looking back at uh listening to
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
the testimony earlier from the ncci
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
the trend has
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
been it's been the rate has decreased
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
now there was a year when went up to one
 
04:34:22.750 --> 04:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
would decrease less than the time before
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
that but overall the rate has been
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
decreasing we have not had spikes like
 
04:34:31.949 --> 04:34:31.959 align:start position:0%
we did in the in the uh late 90s or in
 
04:34:34.750 --> 04:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
the early 90s the market has has
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
stabilized the indemnity is coming down
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
there's safer workplaces today much to
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
the much to the benefit much the work
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's been done not only by employers
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
but I by employees who meet on a monthly
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
basis with safety and health committees
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
which we advocated for in the law so
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's just one thing we can do to
 
04:35:01.310 --> 04:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
make the system better for working
 
04:35:04.510 --> 04:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
people who by the way have given up the
 
04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
right to sue their employer that's a
 
04:35:11.830 --> 04:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
tradeoff keep that in mind because had
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
this not been in place the exposure that
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
employers would have to lawsuits by
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
employees would be
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
staggering let me give you one quick
 
04:35:23.709 --> 04:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
example and I'll be
 
04:35:27.230 --> 04:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
quiet under the AMA guides which were
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
adopted as part of the
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
reforms you you you get so many weeks
 
04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
you lose a leg it's so many weeks you
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
lose an arm it's so many weeks if you
 
04:35:42.510 --> 04:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
were to take the loss of a limb
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
and go to court with that you'd be very
 
04:35:47.551 --> 04:35:47.561 align:start position:0%
surprised at the difference between what
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
the AMA pays and what the court would
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
pay that's a tradeoff that was made
 
04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
so at what point where is the Tipping
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
Point for all these benefits that have
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
been taken away in contrast to what the
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
industry is currently making so Mr
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
chairman I advocate for this I hope that
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
you will consider this uh and vote in
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
favor of it and clearly it will increase
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
the rates by 5 plus per. but the rate
 
04:36:21.189 --> 04:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
there is room there to increase the rate
 
04:36:24.070 --> 04:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
because there have been decreases year
 
04:36:26.189 --> 04:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
after year after year after year thank
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
introduction of the amendment are there
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%

04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative McKenzie that
 
04:36:42.510 --> 04:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
was a very good
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
presentation uh what I will tell you is
 
04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
as a small business owner I am getting
 
04:36:47.910 --> 04:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
personally squeezed left and right in
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
every direction for everything we buy
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
including insurance and I would say that
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
listening to the insurance commission
 
04:36:56.590 --> 04:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
stating that the costs will go up I just
 
04:36:58.269 --> 04:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
don't feel that this is fair to push on
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
to small business owners as they are
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers too that's all I have thank
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%

sylvestro thank you I'd just like to say
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
that unless you've been in a situation
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
where you've had a family member injured
 
04:37:19.150 --> 04:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
you don't understand it from their point
 
04:37:22.109 --> 04:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
it did happen in my family uh my husband
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
broke his neck on the job in a small
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
company and I think we do need to
 
04:37:30.869 --> 04:37:30.879 align:start position:0%
increase it and I would be supporting it
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%

04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry maybe maybe your neighbor has
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%

04:42:34.590 --> 04:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
one all right everyone got the amendment
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
represent kill over to you sir uh thank
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
you sir uh the original Bill uh I was
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
trying to make it easier for the for the
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
business owner and the employee to
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what situation was
 
04:42:50.310 --> 04:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
happening with the way they were earning
 
04:42:52.190 --> 04:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
money and the way they might be
 
04:42:54.670 --> 04:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
Distributing it to their co-workers tip
 
04:42:57.628 --> 04:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
sharing tip pooling because we find that
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
there's and as I heard uh Mr Summers of
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
the Restaurant Association say that this
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
is one of the Heavy Hitters violations
 
04:43:07.070 --> 04:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
for misunderstandings is a problem and
 
04:43:09.310 --> 04:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
they don't want those violations so I
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
was trying to help him out doing the
 
04:43:13.830 --> 04:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
best I could to help Mr Summers he's not
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
here oh Mr V please con please convey my
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
w best wishes to Mr
 
04:43:22.990 --> 04:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
summer uh so he both he and the employ
 
04:43:24.270 --> 04:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
you know employees really should know
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on what's expected not
 
04:43:28.868 --> 04:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
coerced but what how the how the thing
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
works and I also was concerned because
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
of a change that happened with uh sp269
 
04:43:38.190 --> 04:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
in the prior year that uh we did move
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
the uh uh uh service charge out of tips
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
out of gratuities and now it's just a
 
04:43:47.070 --> 04:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
separate thing but I didn't think the
 
04:43:49.628 --> 04:43:49.638 align:start position:0%
public really might might not know that
 
04:43:51.070 --> 04:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
the service charge isn't going to
 
04:43:53.788 --> 04:43:53.798 align:start position:0%
servers because service Char servers you
 
04:43:56.590 --> 04:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
know uh so I I had that but I since
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
removed that because that that seemed to
 
04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
be a bridge too
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
far uh but what I'd like to have if we
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
could pass this amended version would be
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the uh the employer uh includes an
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
example and rather than just uh as
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
stated or as said example I've had a
 
04:44:18.270 --> 04:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
little specificity here such as tip
 
04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
sharing to be written in the same or
 
04:44:22.830 --> 04:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
famili or similar way to this example
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
servers tip out a percentage of alcohol
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
sales to bartenders and a percentage of
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
food sales to the host another
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
percentage to other support staff and of
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
course the business is free to change
 
04:44:36.070 --> 04:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
the percentages and use whatever formula
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
they want it's just an explanation so
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the server will understand that all
 
04:44:44.590 --> 04:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
all that $300 of cash in their pocket or
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
that uh amount that's on the credit
 
04:44:48.990 --> 04:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
cards might not really be going out the
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
door with them that they expected to
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
give some to the host some to the
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
bartender etc
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
etc um so I thought this would be
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
helpful and that
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh they would keep it now I did eror
 
04:45:05.150 --> 04:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
here because I I did write to uh my good
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
friend Mr avalani to ask his advice on a
 
04:45:08.750 --> 04:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot of point and I didn't hear it back
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
in time so I said that a year would long
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
enough for them to hold on to this
 
04:45:15.390 --> 04:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
signed agreement that says they
 
04:45:17.628 --> 04:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
understand I explain but I've been since
 
04:45:19.070 --> 04:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
since been corrected that the labor
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
department has a three-year look back so
 
04:45:23.230 --> 04:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
that would be one more change that we'd
 
04:45:28.430 --> 04:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.990 --> 04:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
0454 uh to make that three years to be
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with the labor department
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
rules and uh so that's the amendment and
 
04:45:39.550 --> 04:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
there we are okay thank you sir and
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%

Indulgence

04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
Indulgence
 
04:53:20.670 --> 04:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
um we just had representative kahill U
 
04:53:25.030 --> 04:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
make the the motion uh and present his
 
04:53:27.030 --> 04:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment and represent waren do you
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
have a comment yes please thank
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
you reading this amendment number 454 I
 
04:53:37.510 --> 04:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
think it makes things worse um
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
particularly line six through
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
eight or nine where it's suggesting that
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
it would require a business to keep
 
04:53:46.400 --> 04:53:47.390 align:start position:0%
it would require a business to keep
record

04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
of so-called
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
um an example of how the establishment
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
does the tip pooling and when you put
 
04:53:58.990 --> 04:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
something like this into statute even
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
though it's just an
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
example it's going to be very difficult
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
for establishments or restaurant tours
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
or business owners
 
04:54:10.990 --> 04:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
to um interpret that
 
04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
thousand different businesses are going
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
to have thousand different
 
04:54:16.548 --> 04:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
interpretations and this
 
04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
says U examples such as servers tip out
 
04:54:21.868 --> 04:54:21.878 align:start position:0%
a percentage of alcohol sales to
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
bartenders and a percentage of food
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
sales to the host and another percentage
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
to support
 
04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
staff and just in plain reading of that
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
I would think that when you're sharing
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
tips you would uh give a percentage of
 
04:54:40.548 --> 04:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
the tip amount not the percentage of the
 
04:54:42.150 --> 04:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales amount or the food sales
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
amount I don't know you restaurant
 
04:54:45.788 --> 04:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
owners can correct me there but I think
 
04:54:47.788 --> 04:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
it's going to add a lot more confusion
 
04:54:51.788 --> 04:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
instead of clarity and thus I think this
 
04:54:54.990 --> 04:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is a non-starter okay
 
04:54:56.430 --> 04:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to be voting against it
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments are there
 
04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
comments representative K thank you uh
 
04:55:06.430 --> 04:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh you you'll note that it said
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh in line
 
04:55:12.270 --> 04:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
five uh documenting the agreed upon
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
practice and the example was something
 
04:55:17.070 --> 04:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
that I had in this amendment because
 
04:55:20.470 --> 04:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
there was a concern referring it was too
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
vague I think for my friend Mr avalani
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
that we had an example and said said
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
example so I thought would have put some
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
meat on the bones but this is certainly
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
it is up to the business to just provide
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
to decide how and their employees to
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
decide the mechanism and to merely
 
04:55:41.230 --> 04:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
explain how that mechanism Works in
 
04:55:41.240 --> 04:55:42.390 align:start position:0%
explain how that mechanism Works in
their

04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:55:44.910 --> 04:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
operation uh so I'm sorry if it appears
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
to make matters worse uh and I do I I
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
took this example from that uh guidance
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
sheet that I found where described
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
several scenarios at which you could do
 
04:55:56.990 --> 04:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
it there's tips sharing where everyone
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
gets an equal share there's a point
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
system but this was the rather than
 
04:56:02.910 --> 04:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
trying to put everything into the RSA I
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
thought I would put one just say this is
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
an example and and remember that tip
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
pooling and tip sharing as as I read in
 
04:56:12.750 --> 04:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
this document that I sent to All one is
 
04:56:16.150 --> 04:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
a is a me is a means of increasing wages
 
04:56:18.670 --> 04:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
for employees but without cost to the
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
business owner so that's why we have it
 
04:56:24.990 --> 04:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
and this is just a way to have everybody
 
04:56:27.750 --> 04:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
