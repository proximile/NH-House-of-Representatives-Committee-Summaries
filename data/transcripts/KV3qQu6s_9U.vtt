00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
all right now is our chance I guess to
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
move on then
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
um so before I start I'd like to just uh
 
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
say something about representative hatch
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
I think some of you may be aware that he
 
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
did resign on Monday
 
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
it will be a great loss to the house
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
I've known Bill since 2006 which is the
 
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
first year he came to the house he
 
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
served on ways and means
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
I was vice chair over there then he came
 
00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 align:start position:0%
over to finance
 
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with a number of
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
committee at conferences he was a vice
 
00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 align:start position:0%
chair of this division for a term
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
as you know Bill suffered from a injury
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
from Vietnam
 
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
that they could never really get a
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
handle on and as a result he finally
 
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
lost that leg about a month ago
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
he's going to remain I guess he's moved
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
down to Bedford
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
and so he can be closer to rehab and
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
hospital care that he needs to survive
 
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.090 align:start position:0%
hospital care that he needs to survive
so

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank bill for his service and we were
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
seat mates in the house he always
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
insisted for the last couple of years I
 
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 align:start position:0%
sit next to him
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna miss his uh
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
constant advice you've represented the
 
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 align:start position:0%
North Country better than anybody that I
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
knew from the North country and being
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
from Gorham it took him about two and a
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
half hours to get here and being on such
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
a busy committee it just showed his
 
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
dedication so
 
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman I really want
 
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
to Second your remarks
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
um I really have a lot of respect for
 
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 align:start position:0%
people from coax County who come here
 
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
day after day I mean it's it's I live
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
right next door practically by by
 
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
comparison and um
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
but the the loss of Representative hatch
 
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
means that we get to welcome we think
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative grassy to become a
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
permanent replacement so
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
all right so um just very quickly you'll
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
see how we get this set up the first
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
group of bills appeared in the budget
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
we can either continue to hold on to
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
these bills or we can move them off our
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
plate by just a recommendation of itl
 
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
212. does anybody think that we should
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
retain that or representative evil did
 
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
you have anything on that no
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
so if there's no objection would someone
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's been seconded by representative
 
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
sweetie or I have to get my clerking
 
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
sweetie or I have to get my clerking
charts

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
charts
 
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
so and again as everybody knows we'll
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
just be making a recommendation to the
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee chaired by representative
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
Weiler and whenever he sets up that
 
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 align:start position:0%
executive session so once the clerk is
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
ready call yes representative just to
 
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
comment on that uh met with division two
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of these bills that this supposed
 
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
study committee that's going to be
 
00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
required to report by November 1st
 
00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:52.730 align:start position:0%
required to report by November 1st
so

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
we heard from the LBA that we have till
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
November 17th so between November 1st
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
and November 17th after we hear the
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
final on these 436 is another one that
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
applies to then we will make a decision
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
we may retain like 436
 
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
if the study committee comes out with
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
something that we could just amend 436
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
and and keep it alive and bring it
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
forward so you raise a good point Mr
 
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:23.060 align:start position:0%
chairman we have heard from
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire that asked
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
us to hold on to 436 should the
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
commission come out with a
 
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:31.610 align:start position:0%
commission come out with a
recommendation

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason why we won't have
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
an exact session until November if
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to make plans
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
represent of evil
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria that was included has been
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussions I guess some of our
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
Lakes have seen a real problem with this
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
this year but
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on that again it was
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
included in the budget maybe not
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
everything that was requested but the
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
concept and some funding was
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I guess it's my
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
turn I'll move itl
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
um I believe this is in the budget but
 
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
at a lesser amount than the original
 
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.769 align:start position:0%
at a lesser amount than the original
bill

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%

o'clock and does the professor have
 
00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:39.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
all right now being 10 A.M
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have House Bill 571 I know
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a couple of
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this one
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so what happened to this
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
this if you recall was the bill to give
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
a cost of living adjustment to group two
 
00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.070 align:start position:0%
a cost of living adjustment to group two
members

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
um certain ones not not everyone who
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
were who were retired for a certain
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
period of time and we put it into the
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
budget and I think it was part of the
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
whole compromise thing that we did with
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
436 and
 
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
um other parts and
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
um the Senate changed it
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
to a bill that was for all retirees not
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
just group one but you know group twos
 
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
as well and
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
um very few of them so it it I think
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
ours bill was if you were retired 10
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
years or more then and and your and your
 
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
pension was under a certain amount but I
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
think they changed it to maybe 20 years
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
or more retired and pension even less
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
and and our bill
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
um our version I think that this stipend
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
was somewhere between
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
three thousand and one thousand
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
something like that whereas theirs was a
 
00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:03.539 align:start position:0%
flat 500. so
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so it was quite fairly different
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
um now we could just you know like we
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
did for these other bills just say itl
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's good enough right or we could
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
um put back our version into the bill
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
send it on to the Senate and let them
 
00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:23.060 align:start position:0%
deal with it a second time you know
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
individually it's I'm not
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't have any big
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
I would support putting our version back
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
in and you know passing this bill with
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
the version that we sent over and let
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
the Senate deal with it again
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know it seems to me like this I
 
00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:56.180 align:start position:0%
don't just kill it again
 
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative camberos okay everybody
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
be quiet yeah so one thing that my
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
reading of the final
 
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.829 align:start position:0%
reading of the final
um

00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement was that essentially
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's no money left
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
right in the checking account that that
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
they left all the extra money in the
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
education trust fund crazy kind of a
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
crazy thing but so if we were to put
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in we'd have to
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
the question is where are we getting the
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
9 million or whatever it would cost so
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
I put in a bill to have all that Surplus
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund lapse to the
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
general fund but that won't pass till
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
middle of next year
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
represent kimberles yeah I mean I would
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
have preferred for this to pass but I
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
think at this point
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
um the Senate we did spend a lot of
 
00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
money on the budget and they did get
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
something out of it so I would recommend
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
to itl
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
it's been moved itl by representing
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
my recollection and it could be wrong
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
was our committee had retained this
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
not position or opinion but under the
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
likelihood that since it was a Senate
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill they would likely include it in
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
their version of the budget they did not
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
do that so I would I'd move itl on this
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
since they did not see fit to included
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
all right representative Sweeney
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
has moved itl on Senate Bill 128 and
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's seconded by representative
 
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.410 align:start position:0%
it's seconded by representative

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay itl71
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts analysis
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Environmental
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
Services and we had a lot of discussion
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none of someone like them oh no
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
no I have thoughts okay I just
 
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative evil has thoughts so many
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
papers flying here you know when we move
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
so quickly
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so we retain this bill for uh for
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
um and I think the concern that was
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
expressed at the original hearing was
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
the sorts of facilities that this was
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
going to um be affecting and I did look
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
around a little bit I looked at the
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
definition of facilities that we have in
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
our statute the only place that I really
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
saw anything was um in our Solid Waste
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
statutes and it was specifically for a
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
solid waste disposal site and then there
 
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
was another statute on um on hazardous
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
waste I think it's really difficult and
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps on this and and I think
 
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to Define facility it's at
 
00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:25.339 align:start position:0%
this point because the person that Des
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
would hire pursuant to this bill one of
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
the things that they would be looking at
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
was the sorts of facilities that um this
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
would apply to
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so I would propose not concerning
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
ourselves at this point about defining
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
facilities and in fact if if we did we
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
might limit it in a way that
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
is not helpful for the future
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
um you know I I did look a little more
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
into the cumulative impacts analysis I
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty self-evident what it
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
is it's um
 
00:41:06.609 --> 00:41:06.619 align:start position:0%
the the idea being that when you're
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
licensing something
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
that is in the area of another polluting
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
um entity you should be taking
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
everything into consideration
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
um or whatever this person recommends
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
and not be permitting like air pollution
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
or water pollution
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
um in a in a vacuum which I think is
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
something that's worth looking at
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing I would add
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
here and Mr Hoffman can uh clarify if
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but I think this you know this
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
is a a finance committee issue the
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
policy committee recommended unanimously
 
00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
that this be passed I think it passed
 
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:54.500 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
307-77 or something like that it was an
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
overwhelming vote it passed
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
um very strongly out of the house the
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
amen I mean the Senate the amendment
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
here was supported and introduced by
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
Senator abard who's the chair of the
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
Senate and I think in our role as the
 
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
finance committee we should be looking
 
00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:21.950 align:start position:0%
finance committee we should be looking
at

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and I think this is a worthwhile
 
00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
Endeavor so I would support
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire I remember you had a
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
lot comment on this yeah and I you know
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
I was opposed to this all along and
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
still am
 
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.170 align:start position:0%
still am
um

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
basically I mean this is hiring a new
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
person uh to to Des and giving them
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
a very vague Charter in my in my opinion
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
it this
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
um is asking them to regulate
 
00:42:59.650 --> 00:42:59.660 align:start position:0%
essentially so first of all this is not
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
a statute law this is chapter law right
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
so this is just sort of giving them a
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
direction and saying you know head in
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
this direction and you you know affect
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
your rules and it even says statutes in
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
in a certain way but it's not limited to
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
um the water section or the air section
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
or the way you know the solid waste
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
section and so on it's it's for
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
everything Des does and there and it's
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
asking to regulate people not based on
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
what they do but based on what other
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
people in their quote geographical area
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
do and it and it doesn't say is the
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
geographical area the town the county
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
the state who knows right so I think
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's giving this new employee
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
just a lot of you know sort of a vague
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
Direction and they can get into
 
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.410 align:start position:0%
Direction and they can get into
regulating

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
regulating
 
00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.490 align:start position:0%
regulating
[Music]

00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
um business and development in a way
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to be you know
 
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
potentially very expensive
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm opposed to
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
I was always
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
kind of vague about cumulative impact
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
analysis it could be anything anybody
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
decides it and you might have the thing
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
all decided and someone say what about
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
it's something you never heard of before
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
how do you think that has I'm pretty
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
sure it does and it's some of this is so
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
subjective of what do you think
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact is I don't think
 
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.870 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact is I don't think
that's

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
I do you know I could sit there and
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
argue about it all day
 
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.210 align:start position:0%
argue about it all day
so

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
who knows representative Griffin yeah I
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
too have real concerns about the open
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
endless open-endedness of this uh
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
and I think it's another case of the
 
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.530 align:start position:0%
and I think it's another case of the
legislative

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:56.540 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
legislature uh giving away
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
their Authority on laws and letting GES
 
00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:05.420 align:start position:0%
write the laws
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I think when people look
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
at cumulative impacts on a project one
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
of the things that you're not
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
considering is that you know you may
 
00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
have a business in your community which
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
discharges into your sewer system or
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
discharges may have runoff that is not
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
significant in its impact
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
and then Upstream another company
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
decides they want to locate and they're
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
going to have the same kind of impact on
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
the water and if you look at it by
 
00:45:37.859 --> 00:45:39.170 align:start position:0%
the water and if you look at it by
itself

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
you say okay it's not a significant
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
impact but when you include it with
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
what's already in the Watershed of that
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
area now you've got a significant impact
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
and the thing is is that when we look at
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
projects when a planting board looks at
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
a project they look or when Des looks at
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
a project they look at a project
 
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.050 align:start position:0%
a project they look at a project
isolated

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
isolated
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
and not considering other environmental
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
factors that are involved surrounding it
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
we look at just what's on the site it's
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
something used to frustrate me as a town
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
planner when we look at runoff we would
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
look at what's the runoff on this site
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
and you know you could meet the
 
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
standards and particularly when you're
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
looking at and let's use the example of
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
runoff you want the law says you can't
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of runoff that goes
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
off the site at a particular time so we
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
do is we extend the time of the runoff
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't increase the volume it
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
extends it if you put three projects
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
into that same area that are all
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
extending that water you all of a sudden
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
now have flood situations Downstream
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
which which are much longer a period of
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
time so we need to take a look at the
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
of you know when one project goes in it
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
may be fine when the second project it
 
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
may be fine when the third pro project
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
goes in it may break the camel's back as
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
far as the environment is concerned and
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
this is the reason why we need to do
 
00:47:00.119 --> 00:47:01.250 align:start position:0%
this is the reason why we need to do
this

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
Des needs to take a look at this these
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
projects not just one at a time ingest
 
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know just that project but you need
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
to take a look at everything else that's
 
00:47:14.089 --> 00:47:14.099 align:start position:0%
going on around it as well and I think
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
that this is important to do whether it
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
be an air quality whether it be in in
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
drainage uh and and water quality I
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
think this is something that will make a
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
difference I think the policy committee
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
decided that
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
and they agreed with that and as someone
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
who has worked in the field
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we have this
 
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
consideration at DES and so I would
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
support ought to pass and recommend
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
I do have a quick question that maybe
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
one of you will be able to answer it
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
since it was a Senate Bill do we know
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
why the Senate didn't include it in
 
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's really important to clarify here
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
that all this Bill does is it authorizes
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
the department to hire somebody to
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
review the statutes nothing and
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
regulations absolutely nothing is going
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
to change until there's a report given
 
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.030 align:start position:0%
to change until there's a report given
and

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
um the person who's doing the reporting
 
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:22.220 align:start position:0%
from Des presents their findings
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
discusses potential legislation and
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
potential rule making Authority I mean
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
the appropriation here is about it's for
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
two years for the salary for about it
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
looks like 210 000 dollars so there's
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing here that requires
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
or authorizes even the department to do
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
anything except to look at the at the
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
rules and the statutes that are in
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
existence and given the strength of the
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
policy recommendation coming out of the
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
house and the fact that the Senate
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean I don't have the vote on it Mr
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hoffman but I think
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
I thought it was unanimous but I don't
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
want to I don't want to overstate the
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
case I just think for two hundred
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars it's worth authorizing
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
them to look over their rules and
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
regulations Mr Hoffman that was a Voice
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
vote in the Senate
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes represent people Mr
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
Irwin from the conservation law
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
Foundation is here I didn't know if he
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to say something how you if you
 
00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:47.579 align:start position:0%
would authorize him to or I just wanted
 
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
to mention it
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
I've known as being pretty liberal
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
allowing people to speak especially from
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
the public so would you like to speak
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
take a chair and state your name for the
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman committee members
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Tom Irwin I'm
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
with conservation law Foundation I
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
direct our New Hampshire office
 
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
direct our New Hampshire office
um

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think the the the policy
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
purpose behind this bill has been well
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
stated and explained really well
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
um by representative yebo by
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative grassy I think the only
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
thing I would add is the significant
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
Public Health uh element uh and the the
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
public health importance of this
 
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.190 align:start position:0%
public health importance of this
legislation

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.510 align:start position:0%
legislation
um

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
if we think of uh for example a
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
a facility that emits air pollution uh
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
with a permit from Des
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
but complies with that permit qualifies
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
for a permit
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
um if that facility is within
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
a close distance of another facility and
 
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
a community the additive cumulative
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
effects despite each individual permit
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
complying uh could be significant
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's it's really
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
important to engage in this analysis and
 
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:32.630 align:start position:0%
important to engage in this analysis and
um

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
to representative Wyler's point it's
 
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:38.540 align:start position:0%
it's complicated as to how you Define
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact so I think it's really
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
something that would be a challenge any
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
state any legislature to do it's really
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
something that is in the purview and the
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
expertise of the department so
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
um you know for that reason I think
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
the bill makes sense in providing
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
resources to the department to engage in
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
that analysis and then as representative
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
Ebel said
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
to report
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
make recommendations But ultimately it
 
00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:14.420 align:start position:0%
will be up to the legislature as to how
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
statutes how or whether statutes should
 
00:52:17.819 --> 00:52:19.190 align:start position:0%
statutes how or whether statutes should
change

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
so I think um
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
that's all I have
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
to be happy to answer questions
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
represent Kimbrell's
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I agree that
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
I would have thought that when and
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
during the permitting process cumulative
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
analysis would be done as a matter of
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
course is it not done already
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
every facility is looked at on its own
 
00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:48.980 align:start position:0%
as to whether it and it alone satisfies
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
whatever standard is that issue for
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
purpose of permit issuance
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
and are you aware of uh any other
 
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
states that are doing that now
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh more and more States across the
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
country are looking at this issue
 
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
um I believe I believe
 
00:53:10.619 --> 00:53:12.530 align:start position:0%
um I believe I believe
um

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.870 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
bit of impacts analysis
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
um state of New Jersey is those are just
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
a few that I'm aware of but this this is
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
being recognized as an important public
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
health issue yeah just a follow-up
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
that's sure and it seems to me as an I'm
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
a retired engineer it's a very
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
complicated process would that not
 
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
greatly slow down the permitting process
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
and slow down the uh the ability for the
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
economy and to you know expand
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could speak to how much
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
it would slow down the process I think
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
that speaks to the importance of Des
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
doing this analysis up front I think
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll know from that analysis how
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
complicated it is
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I think we'll you know
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
I think again defining what cumulative
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
impacts are and how they are assessed is
 
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
is really important and um is again I
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
think best suited because of its
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
complexity to the Department
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and I think they could certainly
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
speak to through that process how it
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
would affect the individual permitting
 
00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:22.730 align:start position:0%
would affect the individual permitting
process

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
since we're looking at this from a
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
financial standpoint
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
I would think Des is unable to do that
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
on their own go to rulemaking and and do
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
that rather than spending a couple
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand if someone
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
sit there for two years or a year going
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
over all the rules and and you know they
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
if if they really find this is something
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
that should have been included in a
 
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
review put it in rules go to go to jail
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
car see if they get an agreement on how
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
this would be done rather than have
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
someone spend two years or a year
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take that long to go through
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
and try to figure how this would apply
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
to each of these ones they're looking at
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
well there is a gentleman from Des
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
hiding in the background there that
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
maybe he'd be willing to speak to your
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
question or comment representative
 
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
Weiler are there any further questions
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
sir represent Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
um do you have any concrete examples
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire like Dupont had a
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
plant in Concord and then uh Dow
 
00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:42.059 align:start position:0%
Chemical built a plant in Manchester and
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
they screwed up the Merrimack Rivers so
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
Budweiser in Merrimack could no longer
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
bottle beer or you know something like
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
that is it no I I I don't and I also
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
think that the geographic scale you
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
defined is probably much broader than
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
what Des would come back with in terms
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
of how to Define cumulative impacts I I
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
suspect that
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
it probably would not say carve out the
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
entire Merrimack River Watershed uh
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
something at that scale they might might
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
look at a sub-watershed scale but no I
 
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:20.579 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
any examples of something like that I
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
think a lot of this is really about
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
being proactive and ensuring you know
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:32.349 align:start position:0%
for example
foreign

00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
with Saint gobain's and Merrimack is not
 
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
the motivator behind this legislation
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
but I think pointing to that as an
 
00:56:39.839 --> 00:56:41.510 align:start position:0%
but I think pointing to that as an
example

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.770 align:start position:0%
example
um

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
if so Saint gobangs were continuing
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
operations there and another facility
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
came in and we're to set up shop and
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
could get a permit because standing on
 
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
its own uh
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
you know the air emissions are not of
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
concern but again if you come if you
 
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
were to combine those two facilities
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
that could be a significant
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
health issue for for the community so a
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
lot of this is about being proactive
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative McGuire
 
00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:18.530 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative McGuire
so

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
the way I think about this is
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
that over time when when an area grows
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
let's think about Los Angeles or
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
something right you know air pollution
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
got worse they're in a bowl and so the
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
over time air pollution got worse and
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
worse and and restrictions on on
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
exhaust emissions from Cars got more and
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
more astringent right and so
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
isn't it the case that when you permit
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
some some use
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
that person doesn't somehow take 50
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
percent of all the pollution that you
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
know you permit somebody to be able to
 
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.150 align:start position:0%
know you permit somebody to be able to
be

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
you know one percent of what would be
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
really harmful or half a percent of what
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be really harmful or something
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
like that so so things build up slowly
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
over time in the sense that here's a
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
half percent polluter and there's
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
another quarter percent polluter and
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
there's a you know and so there's a lot
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
of time to say wait a minute you know
 
00:58:25.329 --> 00:58:25.339 align:start position:0%
our limit of so many parts per million
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
should be you know half or something you
 
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
see what I mean it's not like one new
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
guy is ever going to
 
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:38.180 align:start position:0%
really kick off a serious pollution
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
circumstance is am I right or am I wrong
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
I think under under
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
the best circumstances yes things happen
 
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:51.059 align:start position:0%
slowly over time but in a confined area
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
it could happen quickly if you get the
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
wrong facilities multiple facilities
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
again and this gets to Geographic scale
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that's something that the
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
department would look closely at how do
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
you define the geography for purposes of
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
of assessing cumulative impacts but
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
um at at a small enough scale
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
you could have two permitting decisions
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
that have two permitting decisions and
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
two facilities that have a real impact
 
00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:22.490 align:start position:0%
two facilities that have a real impact
on

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative grassy I believe it was a
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
question based on the discussion we just
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
had here wouldn't it this bill I mean if
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
we just let things do go on their
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
natural progression you wouldn't find
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
out that there was a problem until after
 
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
the new building new new project was
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
approved and built this bill would be
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
able to allow us to anticipate you know
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
if they change their rules and
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
regulations be able to anticipate
 
00:59:54.849 --> 00:59:54.859 align:start position:0%
problems before they become problems
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
yes I would strongly agree with that
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions for you
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much your testimony was
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
and if you could state your name and for
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
the record police uh Craig Wright with
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I serve as the air director I'll just
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
put that on the table I'm not a water
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
guy a waste guy but I am here to
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
represent the department as a whole
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about with cumulative
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
impacts it sounds very simplistic as to
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
what it is but it's actually very very
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
complicated it it depends
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
on the level and the depth at which you
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
go at evaluating cumulative impacts
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
it could be as simple as as we as some
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned two facilities
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
locating next door to each other and
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
they both individually need the combine
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
comply with the standards but do you add
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
those two together somewhere off site
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
so we do do some level of interactive
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
analysis on the air level
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
it's in very limited cases but it's
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
primarily for what we call criteria
 
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.049 align:start position:0%
primarily for what we call criteria
pollutants

01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
pollutants
 
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.059 align:start position:0%
that's mainly things regulated under the
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
federal Clean Air Act so in those
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
limited cases we do look at what is the
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
combined impact of two facilities
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
located next to each other we even take
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
into consideration what's in the general
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
air quality of the state
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's called through a tool we call
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
Interactive modeling
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
where we don't do interactive analyzes
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
is on the air side is an air toxics we
 
01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
have a standard and all we require is
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
the source demonstrate their individual
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
compliance it does not take into
 
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
consideration background or other
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
sources nearby so and that's just on the
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
air side and then you start to add in
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
well what about the impacts of what I'm
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
breathing with what I'm drinking with
 
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
what I'm absorbing through taking a
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
shower or something like that so it can
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
get very in-depth in very complicated
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
very fast
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
the department has not taken a position
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
on this bill the department will
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is an issue
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
that is being discussed very locally we
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
hear this issue a lot at public hearings
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
people raising this issue and how is the
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
department addressing it and generally
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
what we tell them is we don't have rules
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
that address what you're asking us to
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
look at it's being looked at at a
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
national level EPA is looking at it we
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
were I was at a recent meeting with the
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
EPA region one administrator and we
 
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
somebody from the audience asked how
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
does EPA Define cumulative impacts EPA
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a definition they're
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
looking at it too
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that would have the
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
department do a study look what's going
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
on around the country
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
um I know representative Wiley
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
questioned about whether we had the
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
resources to do this now we would
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
strongly say we do not have the
 
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
resources or the staff to do this
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't object to the
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
bill if you took the position out of the
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
bill I think the department would object
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
to it we just don't have the bandwidth
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
to do the level of analysis
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
um that's long-winded answer to a couple
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
different questions I could certainly
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
answer more
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Sweeney thank
 
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for being here
 
01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:29.900 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
so for the fiscal note of 247 thousand
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
dollars it's two years of salary
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
benefits and operating costs and
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
equipment for an environmentalist for LG
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
27 step four hired
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
couple of questions on this sure are
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
there any vacancies in a similar
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
position currently at the department uh
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
I know in the air division there's a
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
couple vacancies right now but we're
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
currently filling them for other
 
01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
purposes okay so I would say at least in
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
the air Division I don't have somebody
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
this position even though it's going to
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
be looking over the entire working on
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
the department would be housed in the
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
air division because we have an
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
environmental health program and would
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
be a good fit there but no I do not have
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
a position that I could fill okay follow
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
up Mr chairman and I appreciate that
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
you're just the air division C yep not
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
necessarily the whole department which
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
this position is hired for
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
we hire somebody for two years for this
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
position year three is going to be in
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
the budget to continue this position in
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
a new study position or will we cut this
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
from the budget I guess I don't know
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
what I don't know but I would say it's
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
certainly a possibility that it would
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
exist beyond the two years time frame
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
because if you remember what this
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
position would do is it would create a
 
01:04:43.859 --> 01:04:45.049 align:start position:0%
position would do is it would create a
report

01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:45.059 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
that would go to the legislature
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
potential changes to statutes and rules
 
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
and if there were recommendations in
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
there and something were to come out in
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
statute then the department would need
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
to talk about implementation of those
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
changes so I could see the work
 
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
continuing beyond the initial two years
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel followed by
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much but just to
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
clarify what you just said if the
 
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.370 align:start position:0%
clarify what you just said if the
legislature

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
decide to pursue it it's not like you're
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
going to have a position there that will
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
be continuing would be terminated right
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
yeah unless we found a different funding
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
source and another uh responsibility for
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
that person to do correct
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
and then the other one more question
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
um is there a definition of facility in
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
the air
 
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
statutes that you're aware of we have
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
multiple definitions of facility
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
stationary Source we could certainly get
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
them if you wanted to see them I
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
actually what we're looking at is a
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
operation that occurs on a piece of
 
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.270 align:start position:0%
operation that occurs on a piece of
property

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
generally we look at
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
Asos is it an individual Source if it's
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
under common ownership and control
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
so if you had two buildings next to each
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
other that were under common ownership
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
and control then we would consider that
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.799 --> 01:06:18.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
could you tell us again as far as what's
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
going on at the at the national level I
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
mean I guess my thought is that if there
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
are lots of things happening at the
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
national level for us to kind of get
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
ahead of it is in a I mean to sort of
 
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
anticipate and do our own analysis of
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
I mean that's always that's always the
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
question right
 
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.130 align:start position:0%
question right
um

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:45.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
I would suspect it will take EPA
 
01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
sometime to figure out how how they
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
Define cumulative impacts they talk
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
about it all the time in every grant
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
program they deal with
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
um but they haven't defined it
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
um It's Not Unusual I mean New Hampshire
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
has been a leader at some points in the
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
past but different environmental things
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
um it's just a question of whether we
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
think the timing is right now for New
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
well I've always heard that our air
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
quality is affected by what's happening
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
in New York and Ohio that is true and we
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
can't we can't have any control of what
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
they do in increases and we keep getting
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
complaints from Canada that we're
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
affecting their air quality in Eastern
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
Canada which I guess they're now getting
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
even with all the forest fires but
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know so the some of these things are
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
beyond our control
 
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:44.579 align:start position:0%
and yet they could they could be brought
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
to our effect and we could be
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
impoverishing the people of New
 
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of what's happening
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
and another place in the in the North
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
America so you know it's it's hard to
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
take that all into effect New Hampshire
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
certainly is a downwind state
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire has gone to battle with
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
upwind States many times in different
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
venues uh before EPA even some actions
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
in court
 
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
um dealing with pollution coming into
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
is is a challenge
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
um EBA EPA has some responsibility there
 
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
to help manage those situations and
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
under the current Administration they've
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
been a little bit more aggressive in
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with upwind States pollution
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
going downwind but it's still not
 
01:08:31.799 --> 01:08:35.809 align:start position:0%
going downwind but it's still not
perfect

01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
so not to put you on the spot you said
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
the department really wasn't taking a
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
position one way or the other but you
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
said there's this is a good thing
 
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.570 align:start position:0%
said there's this is a good thing
so

01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:46.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we as you know look to the
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
Departments to give us some real strong
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
guidance whether this is like a make or
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
break bill or not necessary so
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
would you rather see this pass or wait
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
and bring it up at a later date I I
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
would say that this is an important
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
issue that's not going away
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't think that it's a bad idea
 
01:09:14.329 --> 01:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
for the Department to look at this
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
um we may not come back with all the
 
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
answers in two years I mean two years is
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
a relatively short period of time to
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
look at something that I think is very
 
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.450 align:start position:0%
look at something that I think is very
complicated

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to leave it at that
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
represent grassy
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that there was one thing
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
that you said that what I felt was very
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
important and that when you go to
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
hearings people are talking about this
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
people are asking you questions about
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
this you know what are the cumulative
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
impacts on a project and you know what's
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
happening next door to this project and
 
01:09:47.209 --> 01:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
what what happened in the response of
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
the department gives them is that we
 
01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
don't look at that
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
and I think that right there says that
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
we need to do something that we should
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
be looking at it and again I go back to
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
the the background that I have in
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
engineering with with drainage you can't
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
look at a project in a vacuum we need to
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
be looking at this accumulating and and
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know I I think it's
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
good you said that this is something you
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
really should be looking at even though
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
you're not officially taking a position
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
because I mean when the citizens are
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
asking these questions and the
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
department says we don't look at that
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
that's not acceptable
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
and but I understand you don't have the
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
regulations in place
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
you look at every project pretty much in
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
a vacuum and that's not the way we
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
should be doing it regardless and this
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
is small money to pay to get our rules
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed so that when people ask are you
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
looking at that you can say yes we've
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
considered that and the project is good
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
or the project is bad one or the other
 
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
or we need to make improvements I mean
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
we we've got to get ahead of this curve
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
because it's catching up to us and I
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
hate to see it that you know that that
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
we we tell people that we don't look at
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
that and then we have another single
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
bands on our hands we have problems that
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
we are going to spend millions and
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars correcting if we
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
I have a question for representative
 
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
grassy I'm going to call your expertise
 
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
now I know that at some point the
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
legislature passed legislation giving
 
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
towns planning boards uh the authority
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
to look at Regional impacts like if
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
there's a development next door they can
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
participate or to your point say if you
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a shopping center and there's not a
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
need for a traffic light and then
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
another one goes across the street now
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
there's a need for a traffic light
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
because they're looking at impacts do
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
you see this as like something similar
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
to at least
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know nothing yeah I do I think
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
that though that when we we look at a
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
lot of these projects whether it be
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
traffic impacts or it be drainage
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
impacts or it'd be air quality impacts a
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
lot of times we depend on Des to assist
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
us they do the reviews and if Des says
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
this Project's okay then the planning
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
boards sort of got their hands tied I
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
mean I've as a planner if Des came back
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
and said this project is is fine
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
I can't recommend to my board to deny a
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
project in in good conscience my board
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
may not be happy with it because they're
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
saying well we've got all these kind of
 
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
projects you know problems with traffic
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
and I say well you know dot says there's
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
no you know we're not gonna it doesn't
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
meet the the standards you have to do
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
something and they you know when we take
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
a look at traffic we tend to look at
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts because you have
 
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
traffic studies done
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
um when you do drainage studies
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when you do drainage
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
studies you only look at one project and
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
vacuum when you do air quality studies
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're saying this now that yeah
 
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
occasionally we do look at things you
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
know in in a regional impact but most of
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
the time it's a project in a vacuum and
 
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
I think that this would give us more
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
regulations to be able to look at
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to a regional
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
a project or Regional impact which I
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
think is very important I actually have
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
a bill dealing with that with landfills
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
um and and that we should be looking at
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
them as a regional impact project and
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
Des should be looking at them as a
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
region impact project as well when they
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
review the project instead of project
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
and vacuum you know there may be things
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
that they'll put in their rules and
 
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
regulations that will say this will be a
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
trigger that if it meets this trigger
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
point then we will review it
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
um and and if it doesn't meet this
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
triggered point we won't review it and
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know that's something they're going
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
to have to look at and make those
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
determinations in their rules and
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
regulations that they make up and I
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
think that you know we do that in at the
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
local level uh where we have the ability
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do it we don't have scientists on
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
staff at the local levels we don't have
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
the engineers you know we have
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
Consultants Consultants that we work
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
with and sometimes they will bring
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
things to us but most of the time
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
um you know I
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good thing that we
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
that they should have this this ability
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
to do and I think again as I said it's a
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
small dollar that will help us
 
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.290 align:start position:0%
small dollar that will help us
hopefully

01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.510 align:start position:0%
hopefully
uh

01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
stop spending big dollars down the road
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
because if we don't do this it's going
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
to be far more costly
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire followed by evil
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can you answer
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
either of my previous two questions one
 
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.669 align:start position:0%
either of my previous two questions one
was

01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh about the the amount of Regulation so
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
let's say some chemical would at a
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
certain parts per million would cause
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
one more case of cancer per year in New
 
01:14:30.659 --> 01:14:31.550 align:start position:0%
one more case of cancer per year in New
Hampshire

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
do we allow
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
any project to have that amount right or
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
do we say well you can't have more than
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
a thousandth of that amount or a
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
hundredth of that amount or something
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
like that I mean where where do we draw
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the line on in general so in in general
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
if um and I'll use air again as an
 
01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.450 align:start position:0%
if um and I'll use air again as an
example

01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.229 align:start position:0%
example
um

01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
if somebody was subject to a modeling
 
01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:57.709 align:start position:0%
if somebody was subject to a modeling
analysis

01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:15:00.169 --> 01:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
they would be allowed to go right up to
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
the standard as an individual source
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
right but that's not my question my
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
question is how do you set the standard
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
well for the ear toxics is is we
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
we have a very prescribed method in the
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
statute and then the rules is how we set
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
the health-based standards we start with
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
EPA I'm sorry acgih American Conference
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
of gen industrial hygienists they have
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
what they call worker worker safety
 
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:26.990 align:start position:0%
what they call worker worker safety
values

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
values
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
we take those worker safety values which
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
are basically designed you're exposed
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
five days a week eight hours a day we
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
convert that to a your com your exposed
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh 24 hours a day 365 days a year over a
 
01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:39.890 align:start position:0%
uh 24 hours a day 365 days a year over a
lifetime

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:40.910 align:start position:0%
lifetime
so

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's a very prescribed methodology it's
 
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
how we set the standard
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
yeah but I didn't quite get from that
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
if you're exposed to that amount like
 
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
how many extra cases of cancer or deaths
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
or something well in theory if you are
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
subject to that amount there should be
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
no long-term health impact to you as an
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
individual unless the value is based on
 
01:16:10.729 --> 01:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
an EPA cancer risk factor
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
then that EPA Factor does have some
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
value of like I want to assume it's a
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
one in a million or something along
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
those lines
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's very low I guess all right
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's very low unless it's you yeah yeah
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
um let me um let me ask the the other
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
question which was can you give us of
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
any specific example of of
 
01:16:38.169 --> 01:16:38.179 align:start position:0%
this happening in New Hampshire right
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
one one exists a new one came in all of
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
a sudden we have a problem I I I can't
 
01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
identify a specific case again but I
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.030 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
evil

01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
evil
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
sorry I did see because so much for
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.739 --> 01:17:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
to remind the
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
can help us is it not true that this
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
bill started in the Senate as a bill
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
that would have required the department
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
to adopt regulations regarding Advanced
 
01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.709 align:start position:0%
to adopt regulations regarding Advanced
recycling

01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
that is what the bill originally started
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
out as
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
well and and
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
um is it true that during the discussion
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a prosecutor isn't it
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
true that I know it's that lawyer in me
 
01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.530 align:start position:0%
true that I know it's that lawyer in me
um

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
um that during the discussion it was
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
decided at the committee level and then
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
within the Senate that rather than just
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
singling out one industry it would be
 
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
better to look more closely at this sort
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
of analysis is more beneficial across
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
the board that's my recollection
 
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.750 align:start position:0%
the board that's my recollection
and

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
answered perfect
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I would just observe that
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
in a state where we are dealing with the
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
unbelievably deleterious effects of
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
saint-gobain which is now closed we're
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
talking about new landfills I mean there
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
are so many hot button large potentially
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
or polluting projects that so much of
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
the populace is concerned with and this
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
was supported so strongly at the policy
 
01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.510 align:start position:0%
was supported so strongly at the policy
level

01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
I really do feel that two hundred
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is small money to try
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
to do this analysis and I wouldn't want
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
to be the one to say that we didn't do
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
it so I still do support going forward
 
01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
if I were in the Des I would tend to be
 
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:50.810 align:start position:0%
if I were in the Des I would tend to be
cautionary

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
cautionary
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
and want everything
 
01:18:52.739 --> 01:18:54.649 align:start position:0%
and want everything
minimized

01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
minimized
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
and an example of this is
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
I spoke with a person that set this 12
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion on pfas totally
 
01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:06.229 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion on pfas totally
unreasonable

01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
a decade ago you couldn't measure things
 
01:19:11.209 --> 01:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
to parts per trillion now suddenly you
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
can and we find things oh 12 parts per
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
trillion I said Give me the
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
give me the data give me the oh it's in
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
the it's in the letter it's in the
 
01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.169 align:start position:0%
the it's in the letter it's in the
literature

01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
literature
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't give me any examples of why
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
he went to 12 parts per trillion and I
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't find any and until this money
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
in this budget went to look in Merrimack
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
at pfas
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
we have no human studies to make the
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
ridiculous claims of 12 parts per
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
trillion I I oppose it I think it's
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
stupid we can have 20 parts per million
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
of arsenic it's a deadly poison
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
pfas are so prevalent they're everywhere
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
in the in the air in the in the ground
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
so that we probably all of us have more
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
than 12 parts per trillion already in
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
our bodies if we use Scotch Guard on our
 
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
clothing or on our rugs or on our drapes
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
or exposed
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
so the the parts we've all absorbed and
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
once it's in your bloodstream it stays
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
there likely
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
we don't know what how it gets rid of
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
because it's it's such a stable compound
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
so dealing with this person in Des I
 
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
find it totally unreasonable and I don't
 
01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
want to have and and the thing that that
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
this is going to cost if you have a
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
water system and suddenly it shows up
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
more than 12 per trillion you'll spend
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars trying to reduce
 
01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
that pfas to 12 parts per trillion which
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
is virtually immeasurable in most
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
situations so I understand if I were in
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
your situation I would be cautious
 
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I would use my abilities from my
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
background to say yes this could be
 
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.270 align:start position:0%
background to say yes this could be
dangerous

01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.590 align:start position:0%
dangerous
but

01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's a little over cautious I think to
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
try to say oh we've got to look at all
 
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
these other factors which are very hard
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
to to put all together and and you know
 
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
for that reason I think that this leads
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
us down a dangerous path that would be
 
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
very expensive and it would be very
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
restrictive this pfas are going to be
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
very expensive if we try to
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
do that to every water supply system in
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
this state and it's going to be money
 
01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
wasted I think when we suddenly discover
 
01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:18.380 align:start position:0%
from maybe the long-term effects
 
01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
in the study in Merrimack which I was in
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
favor of spending a couple of million
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
dollars on and we finally look at human
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
things and we have some data it's not
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to be 12 parts per trillion that
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous and so
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
I I understand Des likes to be cautious
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy that you are because
 
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
that's that's your that's your goal but
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
we have to look at it from the financial
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint is it worth it it's like
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
human cause global warming we will
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
destroy our economy because we might
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
have had this little bit effect on
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
global warming which
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's the sun there's not much we can do
 
01:21:59.290 --> 01:21:59.300 align:start position:0%
about that so I'm opposed thank you
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think there was a question in
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
there but I I do just want to make one
 
01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
comment that I will
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
very strongly state that the Des staff
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
are highly dedicated highly
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
professionally highly qualified
 
01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.729 align:start position:0%
professionally highly qualified
individuals

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
in a mantra from the top on down as we
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
follow the science that's all I'm going
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
comments and testimony seeing no further
 
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
comments and testimony seeing no further
questions

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
thanks again
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
so representative Sweeney would you like
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
to make a motion or comments I'm gonna
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
there is a motion
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative well I kind of did it yes
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
all right I would like to make a comment
 
01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
then okay sure I didn't it wasn't
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
seconded though just a few months ago we
 
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
passed a great bipartisan budget that
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
spent a lot more money than I think some
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
people in this room were comfortable
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
with I know if I had my one say I would
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
have passed a budget that spent less but
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
it was a good compromise between the two
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
parties and we greatly expanded
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
government increased spending and gave
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
our state employees a great raise that
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
would almost design to help retain
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
employees and attract new employees so
 
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
that we could fill some of the vacancies
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
that we heard about earlier today and
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
other vacancies that exist throughout
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
state government
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not going to jump into the
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
the policy of the bill I can register
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
that I don't support it but we're not
 
01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
here for a policy committee we're here
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the finance committee and 247
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars adding in addition to
 
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
the budget we passed for a salaried
 
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
position that I think we can assume will
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
stay with us for the long term into the
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
next future budget Cycles uh to to study
 
01:23:52.679 --> 01:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
next future budget Cycles uh to to study
this

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
policy that was not a direct request
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
from the department and it didn't make
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
its way into the budget is why I would
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
be opposing the ought to pass today and
 
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
if if that were to fail I would happy be
 
01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
happy to make another motion on this
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill I don't
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
I think in the future there were a lot
 
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
of great arguments that representative
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
grassy and representative evil made
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
today that I hadn't heard on this
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
subject prior to and I think in a future
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
budget discussion and debate they would
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Merit there for inclusion
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
in the the overall Department budget but
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
at this moment today I'm not able to
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
support an expansion of another position
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh on top of what we've already did in
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sweeney there
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
was a motion made I apologize I decided
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
to ask for a second but I will second
 
01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
the motion just so we can continue the
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of ought to
 
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.410 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of ought to
pass

01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
when the cleric is ready please call the
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire no
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:25:08.219 --> 01:25:09.530 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
no

01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:12.050 align:start position:0%
no
no

01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.410 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:21.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:28.370 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay the motion fails uh five to three
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
is there an alternative motion
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney I believe is
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
