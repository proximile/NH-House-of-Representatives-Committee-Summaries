body parts body organs like kidneys
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
the thought then was that all the
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
science is there it's in every basement
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
of every academic medical center
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
was to create this ecosystem
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
where he was able to
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to attract businesses
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
1g2z businesses with phds that
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
specialize in a little piece of this a
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
little piece of that bring them together
 
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.110 align:start position:0%
little piece of that bring them together
to

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
the milliard
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
where he has his his facilities
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
now that was four years ago
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
and uh so we we we passed the bill and
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
there was two components of the bill
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
one was
 
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.589 align:start position:0%
one was
10-year

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
tax breaks
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
for any business that came
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
he said
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why he came to the
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to ask for this is that
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
after he got that 16 million dollar
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
every state came after him saying
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't do it in new hampshire come to us
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
they made him big offers to move out of
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
the state move this out of the state
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
and he loves new hampshire he didn't
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
want to move he said to the state you
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
got to help us
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
and he asked for two things he asked for
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
some tax breaks for these small
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
companies moving in
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years now so if a company moves in
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
doing this stuff
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
so now we're four years in so if a
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
company moves in now
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
that'll be six years of tax breaks okay
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
now this is something we don't do very
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
often to give tax breaks but we we we
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
did this
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
the second part was he asked for tuition
 
00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
the second part was he asked for tuition
forgiveness

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
to for these people coming in
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
and that was to be managed by the new
 
00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:07.270 align:start position:0%
and that was to be managed by the new
hampshire

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
business finance authority
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
we created a
 
00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:18.790 align:start position:0%
we created a
uh

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's called the state regenerative
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the big that's the big picture
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
so now we're four years in
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
and in the fall
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh presented the underlying bell which
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
in in the original
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
language of the bill that was of the of
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
the bill that we passed four years ago
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
it said that
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
that the the authority
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
business the new hampshire fund business
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
finance authority was supposed to report
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
annually to the fiscal committee
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
now for four years and representative
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
romney will attest to this as well
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen anything from anybody
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
with a matter of fact we've been asking
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions i wonder how i wonder how
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
army's doing
 
00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.389 align:start position:0%
army's doing
uh

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
so so but senator d'alessandro who's on
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
on uh ways and means in in
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
put a an amendment in or a bill in to
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
say let's also report to house ways and
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
means and senate ways of means
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that it said report every six months
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
so he put specific dates september first
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
and march first

fund this so
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the event that uh there are no takers
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
can we put the money someplace else
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
yes that's what happens with
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
what they call a dedicated fund review
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee that works
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
um actually representative valmi's on
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know we there's a lot of dedicated
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
funds actually there's 300 dedicated
 
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.110 align:start position:0%
funds actually there's 300 dedicated
funds

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they'll put this one on the
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
list in a couple of years just to see if
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that money then and then we actually do
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
we have that we form a bill
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh that you may may not because usually
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's unanimous generally on consent
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
calendar so you guys don't see this but
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
that we do we do say close down this
 
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.910 align:start position:0%
that we do we do say close down this
fund

00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
we say
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
any money left in that fund go back to
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
the general fund or wherever generally
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund so we do we do track
 
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
the general fund so we do we do track
that

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
representative warden thank you
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
just as a clarification on that tax
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
credit is it against business profits
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
tax and business enterprise tax yeah
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
both both
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
both both both bpt and bet
 
00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
both both both bpt and bet
so

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
the other part of our meeting we talked
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
to again
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
it appears that so far they've attracted
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
they say okay
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
we go to department of revenue and say
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
well how many
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
we know it's under 10 because they won't
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
their rule is they want to give us any
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer information if it's under 10
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is their rule which is probably
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to try to protect
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
the businesses
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
and they feel
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
you know under 10 we can kind of work
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
backwards and figure out who's who so
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
so that's fine so we know it's under 10.
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
but she said there's probably six
 
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.590 align:start position:0%
but she said there's probably six
businesses

00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
that have come that have
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
can take advantage of it
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
using it using that uh bp but she wasn't
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
sure if they are she says they probably
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
aren't again when we passed this we knew
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
that all these small businesses weren't
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to be making a profit for a while
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
so we weren't too concerned about the
 
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
so we weren't too concerned about the
bpt

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
bpt
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
you know bankruptcy in the state
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
actually it's going to create more in 10
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
years we're going to reap the benefits
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
of this increase business
 
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.710 align:start position:0%
of this increase business
but

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
but they they do they have to pay bet
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
again but she wasn't sure whether they
 
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
again but she wasn't sure whether they
were

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
filing with the dra and again we can't
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
get it out of the department we have a
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
very close working relationship with
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
department of revenue just like you have
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
a good working relationship with
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh and they would tell us but and i even
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
went to the the commissioner to try to
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
get him for out of versus domino so
 
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.949 align:start position:0%
get him for out of versus domino so
um

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but let's answer your question i
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment um it
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
indicates that it's non-lapsing does
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
that mean that the million dollars goes
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
yet a year it
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
it moves from one year to another or
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's no opposed one yet another and
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's is there another million dollars
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
appropriated no we're just appropriating
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
one million one million period right
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
and actually you know in the original
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill we gave the business finance
 
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.069 align:start position:0%
bill we gave the business finance
authority

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
the um
also

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
the ability to bond money up to 5
 
00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:25.909 align:start position:0%
the ability to bond money up to 5
million

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's not i don't think that's going to
 
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:27.909 align:start position:0%
that's not i don't think that's going to
happen

00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:28.870 align:start position:0%
happen
but

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.470 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
but we we we thought
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
we thought the one million was was
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
enough if if we see that there's
 
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.310 align:start position:0%
enough if if we see that there's
activity

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that you know we may come back to
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
the to the to the legislature again and
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
ask for for additional funding
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
but again but all of this ends in ten
 
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
but again but all of this ends in ten
years

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay and we're into year four already so
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative honey sorry
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative taking the
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
question um should we have a six-year
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
sunset on this fund for the million
 
00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
sunset on this fund for the million
dollars

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
sydney is only goes for 10 years and
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're already into year four
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
you could do that but
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think we're under the clock to try to
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
get this passed at this point
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know what i mean it's
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.789 align:start position:0%
uh you know what i mean it's
um

00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
i think at that i think that at that
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
point in time we'll know we'll know the
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
six that's the final six years is up and
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
we'll i know in ways of means we'll make
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
sure that you know if we're all here
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh but we'll make sure that that that
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
that fund ends
 
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:47.990 align:start position:0%
that fund ends
then

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
i lost it thank you sorry thank you okay
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you the uh i i would assume um
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative that since this whole
 
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
representative that since this whole
bill

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
it was initiated with 10 years
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
everything would stop at the end of the
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
10 years including this fund that's
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative avalani any second
 
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.950 align:start position:0%
representative avalani any second
remembrance

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
remembrance
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
okay you're recognized thank you um
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
seeing as if we adopt this amendment
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
we don't usually have the ability to
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds so would this make it
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
an fn bill
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it goes to a second
 
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it goes to a second
committee

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
committee
so

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
want me to say that yeah it does make it
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
an fm bill and i've i've been
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
the last two days i've been um
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
maneuvering around trying to
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
trying to convince them not to have come
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
here have it go to finance
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh but and i talked to representative
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
i said earlier representative romberger
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
she said she will be talking to the
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
speaker that it that it will come to it
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
will go to finance
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
it is the speaker's um
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
prerogative representative cahill
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:57.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
browning

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
browning
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other industries that
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh
no

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
this was this was a long and hard
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
discussion four years ago
 
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.590 align:start position:0%
discussion four years ago
um

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.029 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's dean came in is quite a
 
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.110 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's dean came in is quite a
salesman

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
salesman
 
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.230 align:start position:0%
salesman
uh

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
and he he he he
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
he said this is the this is gonna be the
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
renaissance of the manchester's
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
you know we're gonna go from our history
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
of being a mil you know
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
a hundred years ago being milltown
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
textile capital of the world
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
he's views this as being the textile cap
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
generous medicine capital of the world
 
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.029 align:start position:0%
generous medicine capital of the world
here

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
we i guess we all bought into that and
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
we'll see
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
it was but it was one that we kept on
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
saying to ourselves how much of a risk
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
is it really going to be in terms of the
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayer of giving these tax
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
breaks and it's turning out to be not
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
that much
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that that
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
like i said earlier knowing that these
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
startups are not going to be making big
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
profits anyway
 
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.669 align:start position:0%
profits anyway
so

00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
we we said i think i think there's
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
something that we we do this could be
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
big this is cutting edge stuff
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh and we and it passed the house in the
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
senate pretty pretty handily as well so
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
um and the governor obviously supported
 
00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:22.789 align:start position:0%
um and the governor obviously supported
it

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
back then so
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
last follow-up and then we're gonna get
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro who might be able
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
to answer some questions but go ahead
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
with your follow-up representative
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
cahill uh i i was thinking that people
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
who are working in this field probably
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
have very advanced degrees and would
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
probably command a high salary
 
00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:38.390 align:start position:0%
probably command a high salary
so

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
is there as much of a need to help pay
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
off their student loans as there might
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
be for other people in other industries
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
well when they yeah i think good
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah a lot of them have phds
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
but when they get more towards the
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
development of the manufacturing
 
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.950 align:start position:0%
development of the manufacturing
processes

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
processes
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's more technical level people that
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
they want to bring in so that they'd be
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
some of these education credits would go
 
00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
some of these education credits would go
to

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.010 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
lower level if you will technical people
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
that will need to be trained in in the
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
processes that they come up with at that
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
other level because this is all about
 
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.789 align:start position:0%
other level because this is all about
and

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the reason the department of defense
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
came to cayman
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
is for one reason they said
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know how to get
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
things done you know how to get
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturing going and that's this is
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
why it's manufacturing it's it's
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing institute
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's trying to take the science and and
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
create the product but then how do you
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
manufacture it by the way they're
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
basically using 3d printing we're
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
talking about 3d printing you know
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
kidneys and livers and whatever else
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
and we're we're there and we're getting
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i think the next
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
oh son
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative alvin has a
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
pressure for a committee so
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
sure if that's all right representative
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh alma you're recognized thank you
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
pretty quick i hope
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.590 align:start position:0%
on the
well

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.029 align:start position:0%
well
first

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
we asked a lot of really hard questions
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
about this project it took a long time
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
they thought i was trying to kill it
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
on i was trying to make sure that this
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
was going to work one of the things that
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
they were working on from the beginning
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
is lungs
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
building new lungs
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and they have actually done
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of experimental
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
transplants into human beings who had no
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
other alternative to this one
 
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.310 align:start position:0%
other alternative to this one
already

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
i don't they're not there quite yet but
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
that is kind of the
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
the peak of of this work
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
is lungs are incredibly complicated
 
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.350 align:start position:0%
is lungs are incredibly complicated
but

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
these are startups
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
and startups
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
are mostly run by young recent phds
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
straight out of the most advanced
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
on with new bright ideas nobody had
 
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.149 align:start position:0%
on with new bright ideas nobody had
before

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:23.669 align:start position:0%
before
and

00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is merging biological
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
science with mechanical engineering
 
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.549 align:start position:0%
science with mechanical engineering
and

00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
it still has the it's been slow setting
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
up it still has the possibility of
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
of exploding into something huge
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
such as we had back in the
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
late in the late 70s 80s
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.350 align:start position:0%
in this state
and

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.230 align:start position:0%
and
on

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
so we decided that we were going to fund
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
that but we did not have the money to
 
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
that but we did not have the money to
fund

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
the tuition
 
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
the tuition
grants

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
on for this
 
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.830 align:start position:0%
on for this
and

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
we asked key wallace the new head at
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
that point of the business finance
 
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.549 align:start position:0%
that point of the business finance
authority

00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh to go out and try to raise the money
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
from donors
 
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.149 align:start position:0%
from donors
and

00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
if he raised enough from donors they
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
were going to bond
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
the 5 million he cannot bond the 5
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars that they were asking
 
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.190 align:start position:0%
million dollars that they were asking
for

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh without having some kind of backup of
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
how do we pay for this
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
later he's a bank
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
that didn't work out i don't know how
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
much effort he put into it
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
we did not have the money at that point
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and we certainly
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't bond it through the regular
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
bonding process because it had already
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
been taken up it was the second year of
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
the biennium it was five years ago
 
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.430 align:start position:0%
the biennium it was five years ago
um

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
it ended up not being funded most people
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
had forgotten that since then but
 
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.549 align:start position:0%
had forgotten that since then but
on

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
the finance we do have the money this
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
year the finance committee is willing to
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
to uh take care of it as long as they
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay anything in the future
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what the bill in front of you
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
does it says non-lapsing means that
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
on we aren't going to take the money
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
back away from you if you haven't
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
finished spending it yet
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say we're going to give
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
you another million next year
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i hope that
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
clears up that part of it
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you any question uh representative
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
warden thank you
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
two-part question
 
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.669 align:start position:0%
two-part question
this

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
amendment that they're asking for is for
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending june
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh june 30th of this year so it goes
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
back in time two years right it's the
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
budget we passed two years ago is that
 
00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.230 align:start position:0%
budget we passed two years ago is that
correct

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh no the the
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
army passed five years ago actually
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
but came into effect four years ago
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
although but the budget that this is
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate appropriation for is the
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
current budget that we're just finishing
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
up correct yeah
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
right okay follow up and
 
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.149 align:start position:0%
right okay follow up and
this

00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
amendment refers to
 
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
amendment refers to
chapter

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
section 162-t3
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
which was when the
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
army regenerative thing was originally
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
set up the credit
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
tax credit scheme
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
chapter it says for repayment of student
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
loan dues
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
the um i'll quote no forgiveness of such
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
student indebtedness shall be affected
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
unless the person shall have been
 
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.870 align:start position:0%
unless the person shall have been
employed

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
employed
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
to perform primarily active regenerative
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing business activities at a
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
location within new hampshire for a
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
minimum period of five years
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
so we haven't even been into it five
 
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.909 align:start position:0%
so we haven't even been into it five
years

00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
what's the rush why couldn't we put it
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
in next year's budget because nobody
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
could even ask for student loan
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
indebtedness repayment until next year
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
that is quite easy our committee is very
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
worried that the money coming in next
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
year is going to be nothing like the
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
money coming in this that has come in
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
and we also know that we owe back a
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
large amount of money to taxpayers
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
that they have left with us on deposit
 
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.470 align:start position:0%
that they have left with us on deposit
on

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
some of it is because they paid taxes on
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
their pp
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
pay loans from the federal government
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
and every other state was giving
 
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.110 align:start position:0%
and every other state was giving
on

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
was telling them you don't have to pay
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
taxes on that we had to pass a law to do
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
that it took a long time they paid the
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
taxes before we did that we have to give
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
that money back
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
we thought they were going to start they
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
may still be giving it asking for it
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
we have no idea how much of it is going
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
to have to be paid back in each year but
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
the total of it is
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem and we also have
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
300 million dollars on account uh in
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
something called credit carry forward
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
which on we just finally it has been
 
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.230 align:start position:0%
which on we just finally it has been
exploding

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
exploding
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
it was a hundred million ten years ago
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
four years ago it was 200 million and
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
now it is over 300 million
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
and they can come back at any time and
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
say we don't want to keep this on
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
deposit with you anymore we're going to
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
we want it back
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
so on we've been talking for quite a
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
long time led by our chair norman major
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
has been most insistent on this
 
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.070 align:start position:0%
has been most insistent on this
on

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
about taking the
 
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.870 align:start position:0%
about taking the
uh

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
figuring out a way to reduce that to
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
something more manageable part of it is
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
half of it we think is just on i put
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
this here and i'm going to be using it
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
all this year and it will be gone by the
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
end of this year
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
the other half is it's been there a
 
00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:19.909 align:start position:0%
the other half is it's been there a
while

00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
and those companies are still here
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
we started doing something about that in
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
the current budget
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
and it was a signal to the companies
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
that if you don't start taking this
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
money back you're going to have to take
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
it back all at once
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
and we think the reason that they've
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
kept it here is that it's cheaper than
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
taking it back and paying taxes on it to
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
so on that that they may start asking
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
for more of that back
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
most people think we're probably headed
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
into a recession
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know what kind of recession
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
so uh we don't want to depend on having
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
so you're all set representative warden
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative sullivan
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
uh representative almi you and i have
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
been having some discussions about this
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill and about the uh
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's rather bizarre that
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
the bill is in this committee
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
ought to be either in ways and means or
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
in finance
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
or both
 
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
or both
but

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
i i guess i would suggest to my labor
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
committee colleagues
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we stay in our lane
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
get out of the way
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
and just move this bill on to the
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
finance committee so they can take care
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
of it this is really not our area um
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily so um
 
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
necessarily so um
i

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
i will accept your advice over the phone
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
that uh you know
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill needs needs to move
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
forward uh the amendment needs to move
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
forward and um we ought to just get her
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
done so um
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
yes i i just while i'm here i want to
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank uh senator d'alessandro for
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
putting this in it is simply a ways and
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
means bill
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
it was in the senate and it should have
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
been here but i don't know how you got
 
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.909 align:start position:0%
been here but i don't know how you got
it

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
but now we've all learned something
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative all
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.350 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative all
mean

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
well it's been a very interesting
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
presentation i might say
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
i come before you as the prime sponsor
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 276. it was a very simple
 
00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 276. it was a very simple
bill

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:57.430 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
as as has uh has has been iterated i
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
represent district 20 manchester awards
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
3 4 10 11 of the town of goffstown
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
i i was on ways and means when we uh
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
passed this bill four years ago
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
we had a new concept that was being
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
developed it was called regenerative
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the department of defense
 
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.549 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the department of defense
gave

00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
gave
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
dean cayman and deca
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
90 billion dollars to create a
 
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
90 billion dollars to create a
not-for-profit

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
that would eventually get into the
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
business of regenerative manufacturing
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
what did that mean that means hearts
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
pancreases lungs livers could be
 
00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:43.909 align:start position:0%
pancreases lungs livers could be
regenerated

00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
regenerated
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
they're currently working on the heart
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
i was a sponsor of the bill
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
the rationale for the bill was it was
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
going to save millions and millions of
 
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.389 align:start position:0%
going to save millions and millions of
dollars

00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
because the troops coming back
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
have very significant medical problems
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
there are other medical problems this
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
particular regenerative situation could
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
address some of those
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
make their lives better
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
and also save millions of dollars which
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
go in at infinatum
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
or until the death of the individual
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
so it made good sense
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
so what was the plan the plan was
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
what about the bpt and the bet could we
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
suspend payment of the bpt and the bet
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
so that this
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
program could get a very solid start the
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
90 million was part of the deal then
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
let's call it stock
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
to different companies so that they
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
would join in
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
about 250 entities have joined in
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
one way or another they're they're
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
aiding the process in its development
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i visited them
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i said gee uh
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
we asked for a report on how things were
 
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.710 align:start position:0%
we asked for a report on how things were
going

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i've never seen that report
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
so i've sent an email every month asking
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the report
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
i've no i've not seen it
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
the genesis of the bill
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that a report comes
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing a good service for them a
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
remarkable service to be honest with you
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the suspension of the bpt and the bet
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
was it was an adventure
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
all right it's something that really had
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
to take a strong look at
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
but in return
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
we should get a report on how things are
 
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.790 align:start position:0%
we should get a report on how things are
going

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i visited
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
they are expanding the lab they are
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
using the lab at unh they're expanding
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
the lab
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
all of these things are in place but
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
what's the progress
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that in essence
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
is the genesis of my piece of
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and the reporting periods
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
that should come to the legislature come
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
to ways and means and come to finance in
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
both the house and the senate
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
we did we did uh
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
we took a very adventurous step forward
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
we should get an accounting of what's
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
there may be others who'll come for this
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
and try to take advantage of this event
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
of this situation we'll have some record
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
we'll have of how things went the first
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
time we did it and what the positive
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
results are so therein is the
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
again the genesis of the legislation and
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
why this piece of legislation is before
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
you now with regard to the loan
 
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.310 align:start position:0%
you now with regard to the loan
repayment

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
repayment
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
we do we already do loan repayment uh in
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of areas by state primary care
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
does it for doctors who come to rural
 
00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.430 align:start position:0%
does it for doctors who come to rural
areas

00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
and uh there there's another one at hhs
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
for for a loan uh for loan repayment so
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
the question was is it being that yes
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's being done are we exercising it at
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
this point in time we just can't get any
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
people no never mind pay loans we give
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
five people
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
we can't find people to pay the loans
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
back for
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
but i think it's essential

to present for your consideration
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill 377.
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
um as amended this bill creates a
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
presumption that an injured injury is
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
occupationally caused if it occurs while
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
a state trooper is operating a state
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
police vehicle in the performance of
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
their official duties
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill deals with a
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
current gap in the law regarding workers
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
compensation for our troopers on the
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
road due to a change in contracts
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
command staff are not recognized as
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
being paid until they arrive at
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
headquarters even though they may be in
 
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.230 align:start position:0%
headquarters even though they may be in
uniform

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
and fully marked cars and they may have
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
to answer calls on their drive in in a
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
similar vein when troopers do extra duty
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
details like working a construction job
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
on the highway or hampton beach these
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
troopers do not get paid for the commute
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
to the site a concern has been raised
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
that during the commute time if an
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
officer is injured in an accident or by
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
some other manner because they are not
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
viewed under the law as on duty at the
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
time then that injury may not be covered
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
by workers compensation
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses that by creating a
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
presumption that if a trooper is
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
operating a cruiser and in their uniform
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
on the way to state function they will
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
be covered under workers compensation
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my introduction and i
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
representative warden
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
you may know the answers but thanks for
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
are there some troopers that take their
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
if a state trooper
 
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
if a state trooper
were

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
if since he some of them can take them
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
home with them he finishes up the day
 
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.349 align:start position:0%
home with them he finishes up the day
working

00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
and then continues in his vehicle his or
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
her vehicle to have dinner
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
and a few drinks
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
on the way home from the restaurant or
 
00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.309 align:start position:0%
on the way home from the restaurant or
bar

00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
bar
 
00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.750 align:start position:0%
bar
crashes

00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
crashes
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
would this
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill give that person coverage
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of the cause of the accident
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
or the level of sobriety
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
in this hypothetical situation of the
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
trooper regrettably i'm not able to
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer that but i know there are
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
experts in the industry behind me who
 
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.829 align:start position:0%
experts in the industry behind me who
are

00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
here to do that and i would prefer to
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
divert to them no no problem i didn't
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
want to put jones by thank you
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
from this uh new hampshire troopers
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
association afterwards that can answer
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
some of those specifics but i would i
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
would gather that uh they have to report
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
from their job right to their home not
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%

that there is coverage under certain
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
under most circumstances
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to their office
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
site but right to their job
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
was there a situation such as the the
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%

we are not allowed to consume any kind
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
of alcoholic beverages while we are on
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
duty nor are we allowed to use our state
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
police cruisers
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
when we are in an off-duty capacity
 
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.349 align:start position:0%
when we are in an off-duty capacity
so

00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the situation of stopping at a
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
restaurant on the way home
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i think you said having a few drinks
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
with dinner or something along those
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
lines um our policies and procedures uh
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and just uh
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
reiterate what was already said with um
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
the introduction of the bill
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
i have the opportunity to work um
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
off-duty construction details or extra
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
duty details and there's been numerous
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
times where i have been traveling to or
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
from that extra
 
00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:02.150 align:start position:0%
from that extra
detail

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
where i was the closest unit to an
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
active call on the radio and i had to
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
respond there
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
before the duty unit could get there
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
and start handling the situation i'm
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
just speaking with another trooper this
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
morning he talked about just a couple
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
days ago being on an extra duty detail
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
on 93 in concord
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
and um he was traveling home from that
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
detail and responded to the canterbury
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
arrest area uh for a medical call and he
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
was the first one there
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
before any on duty units could get there
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
just because of his proximity to that
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
location um and i only bring that up um
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
just because traveling to and from our
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
extra duty details or the command staff
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
traveling to and from headquarters
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
there are many times when technically
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're considered to be in an off-duty
 
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.870 align:start position:0%
we're considered to be in an off-duty
status

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
but we're called to
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
be act in an on-duty capacity
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
to align with our job duties as a state
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
trooper as we are in full uniform at the
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
time and in a state police car
 
00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:05.430 align:start position:0%
time and in a state police car
um

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
to answer your question representative
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
infantine sorry if i mispronounced the
 
00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:12.550 align:start position:0%
infantine sorry if i mispronounced the
um

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
it's been a lot worse pronunciation of
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
your name
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
i don't personally know of a situation
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
where um a trooper wasn't covered
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
to ensure that um we are covered if that
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
situation did occur and um going back to
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
staff sergeant cheryl's situation um
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
where he was killed on i-95 in an
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
automobile accident
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
he was
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
working in a capacity of a
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
construction detail um so it's my
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that um he he was covered
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
as a line of duty injury in that
 
00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:53.190 align:start position:0%
as a line of duty injury in that
situation

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.470 align:start position:0%
situation
excellent

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for mr ross
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
coming and forgive the naivete of this
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
question but
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
um are there any
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh state troopers who are not required
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
in the context of their employment to be
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
in uniform such that they might
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
lose the presumption
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's covered by this bill because
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
while they're in the vehicle they're not
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
in a uniform
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes but in that situation um for example
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a detective so i drive to and from
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the office i'm not in a uniform but
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm considered in an on duty status at
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
that time um
 
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.150 align:start position:0%
that time um
the

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.230 align:start position:0%
the
situations

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
that um we're looking to have covered um
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
typically would be
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
in a uniform capacity but either way
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're just looking to have the off-duty
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
well as i read the uh proposed bill um
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
it would it requires for the presumption
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
to kick in
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
the operating of the police vehicle and
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
wearing the uniform of the day
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
i just i'm not entirely sure whether
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what uniform of the day
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
means to me
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
um if you're a uniform trooper whether
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
it be command staff or a trooper um the
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
class b or c
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
b being the um
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
long-sleeve winter uniform or c being
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the summer uniform
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
that would be the uniform of the day but
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
also for detectives who wear plain
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
clothes their uniform of the day is
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
the plainclothes dress of yeah shirt and
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.309 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
checking the questions
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
so the troopers take their cars home
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and report to work when do they sign in
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
for their job
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
and sign out
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
when they get home or when they're
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually their shift is over
 
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.589 align:start position:0%
actually their shift is over
um

00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the majority of troopers it's um
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
when you leave your house in your
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
cruiser we sign on via radio and then we
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
sign off via radio when we get back home
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
at our house so for the majority of
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
troopers you're on duty when you leave
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
your driveway in the state police car
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
and you're off duty when you get
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
back home the difference is is for those
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
extra duty details when we're traveling
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
to and from the construction site um we
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
are technically in an off-duty capacity
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
and that is the concern so you're really
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
signing into those jobs when you're
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
meeting up with the contractor wherever
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
that extra duty detail
 
00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.309 align:start position:0%
that extra duty detail
is

00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
what if it is not an off-duty detail say
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
you're attending a funeral out of states
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
and you're attending a funeral in
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
a different part of the state you're in
 
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.190 align:start position:0%
a different part of the state you're in
your

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
uniform with the with the
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
your assigned car
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
as this is written at least to me
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
you would be covered under workman's
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
comp if you sustained an injury
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
outside of your normal
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
operations of your vehicle yes i i
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
suppose that would be another uh
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
you could be in an off-duty capacity
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
um and traveling to or from a funeral
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
that would have to be approved in order
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
do those things um the director would
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to approve us to
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
be in uniform and travel to or from a
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
funeral or awake or whatever the
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
ceremony is in the state car so i guess
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
that would be another situation where we
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
could be in an off-duty capacity
 
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.950 align:start position:0%
could be in an off-duty capacity
um

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
being in uniform and traveling to or
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
i can also say that
 
00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:11.109 align:start position:0%
i can also say that
um

00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
in funerals that i've attended in the
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
past um the director of the colonel has
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
indicated that um whoever wants to
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
attend this funeral it could be um a
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
duty day so sometimes
 
00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.510 align:start position:0%
duty day so sometimes
um

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to modify our schedule
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
if we were on a day off um in order to
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
attend a funeral or that kind of
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
ceremonial proceeding
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
follow up if i could yes
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
so do other
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
uniformed officers
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
do the same type of duty off duty when
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
they're doing extra details like we see
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
county sheriffs or we see other officers
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
in other towns
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
doing the same
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
you know construction jobs or monitoring
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
wires or something like that
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
should this be only for state troopers
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
or should we be looking to expand this
 
00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.190 align:start position:0%
or should we be looking to expand this
to

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
other departments that do the same type
 
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.710 align:start position:0%
other departments that do the same type
of

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to pretend to have
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge about um the sheriff's
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
department or local department's
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh detail policies and whether or not
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
they get paid um
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
traveling to or from
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
those extra duty details
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
um so i don't want to comment on that um
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
but i could see that
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
organizations who have that same
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
wanting their employees to be covered
 
00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
wanting their employees to be covered
traveling

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
traveling
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
to or from these extra duty details in
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
in a state vehicle or in a county or
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
town vehicle
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking questions
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony i want to follow up on
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
the you mentioned the ceremonial detail
 
00:53:00.319 --> 00:53:01.190 align:start position:0%
the you mentioned the ceremonial detail
is

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
that also
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
a case where
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
if you're on an off-duty ceremonial
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
detail and something occurs
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
could that officer be called upon to
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
respond to a situation or is that a
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
different animal than what we're talking
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
about with the construction details i
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
would say yes because if we're in if
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're in the worker and we're in
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
especially when we're in uniform um our
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures indicate that we
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
are expected to take appropriate action
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr ross in addition you would
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.549 align:start position:0%
be um
traveling

00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
traveling
 
00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:41.510 align:start position:0%
traveling
to

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.950 align:start position:0%
to
training

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.710 align:start position:0%
training
uh

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
going to the gun range and all those
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
other things as well
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
correct that could necessarily be
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
driving to there
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
or back
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
that that for training that necessarily
 
00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.670 align:start position:0%
that that for training that necessarily
isn't

00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.630 align:start position:0%
isn't
um

00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know before your duty shift would
 
00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.349 align:start position:0%
you know before your duty shift would
start

00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
so in those situations though where we
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
are traveling let's say to the gun range
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
for training um
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're in an on duty capacity already
 
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.430 align:start position:0%
we're in an on duty capacity already
okay

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr ross uh
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative warden thank you thanks
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
for taking a call
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
are troopers allowed to
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
take civilian passengers in their car
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
let's say they
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
finish their shift and then go to pick
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
up a spouse or from work or child from
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
school are they allowed to do that in
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.599 --> 00:54:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
aren't supposed to use our vehicles in
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
an off-duty capacity
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
you can pick up
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
a spouse or a family member in the state
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle i believe
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't have the policy in front of
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
me but i believe you need to get prior
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
authorization to be able to do that
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
i see no further questions
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%

00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
issues if we passed this to expand it to
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
just state troopers
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure and i i would defer to
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps others more familiar with law
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement in general my understanding
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
is is that certain municipalities they
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
don't take the vehicles home so i don't
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
know that it's as much of an issue
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh so again similar to mr ross's
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony i don't know that i'm informed
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
enough to offer you know whether that's
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
a problem that exists or not
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else like to speak on
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will close the hearing and
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
try to get back on track for my mom
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
wage payments
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
i do not have i vote
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%

sponsors of the bill
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
miss wheeler
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for having me
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
i am here on behalf of senator sharon
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
carson from senate district 14
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
representing hudson auburn in
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
londonderry i have for your
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
consideration senate bill 209 which
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
would amend the statutory provisions
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
related to the payment of an employee's
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
wage by direct deposit 29 states
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
including maine and massachusetts have
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
enacted similar legislation and the
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee also heard that 93 percent of
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
u.s workers already receive their wages
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
through direct deposit if a worker does
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
not have a bank account then they have
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
an option to receive a payroll card
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
there are no fees associated with the
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
payroll card unless an out of network
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
atm is used and they are not subject to
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
overdraft or non-sufficient fund fees
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment established a
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
process for an employee to be provided
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
their wages when they cannot access them
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
this addressed a concern raised by the
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
department of labor especially in
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances where employees cannot
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
access funds from their payroll card in
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
addition a change was made to rsa 275 43
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
2c to ensure consistency in the statute
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
you have any questions for the presenter
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman does
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
line 17 on page one
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
refers to line 15 having to do with an
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
employee unable to access their wages
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
due to technical or processing defect
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
and then in line 19 in such a situation
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
the employer shall be liable for late
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
payment of wages
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
whenever the replacement pages are
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
provided under the designated pay after
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
the designated payday so my question in
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
my voicemail to the senator was
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
well if this is a bank problem
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
bank had a hiccup
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
why is the employer responsible for
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
late payments
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
and what is a late payment does this
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
direct payment off of their
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
checking account every month and if the
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
payment's late and those payments all go
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
out and the money is not there
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
then there are going to be um bounce
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
check fees late fees penalties and such
 
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.750 align:start position:0%
check fees late fees penalties and such
so

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
it's just a little too vague for me and
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's where i kind of like to
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
understand what this means
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your question
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i'm not able to answer
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
that i would need to defer
 
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.230 align:start position:0%
that i would need to defer
okay

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.270 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully to the senator we're going
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of need to know a little more
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
specifics on that
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
as it is now i'm uncomfortable with just
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
giving it a thumbs up
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with the bill as is that's i
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately upon us to think of the
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
good the bad and the ugly of everything
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
we write and how it's going to be you
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
know interpreted
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
presenter

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
like to call on w commissioner ogden

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh good morning thank you uh chairman
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
infants hein and committee uh for the
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is rudy ogden i'm deputy
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the department of labor
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
um i did want to start just in terms of
 
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.390 align:start position:0%
um i did want to start just in terms of
context

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
some of the folks who have been part of
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
the committee for some time knows that
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
when these bills or bills related to pay
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
cards have come up in the past the
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
department has historically had
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
concerns relative to payment processes
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
or payment platforms such as pay cards
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh being mandated those concerns have
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
principally been based in three areas
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
for and some of these areas are really
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
policy decisions that the committee
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
needs to make
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
relative to their feelings on these
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
types of platforms but in terms of what
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
the concerns are or have been first is
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
the idea of choice the issue of whether
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
someone should be compelled to take
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
payment on a pay card or not i would
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
note that this bill does say that the
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
individual would have the ability to say
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
i want payment via direct deposit it
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
would be in instances in which they
 
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
cannot or do not set up direct deposit
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
that they can be pushed to the platform
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
of pay cards one thing we do have to
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
remember though is that there is a
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
number of folks and i think the number
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
is larger than we sometimes think who
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
are what they would call unbanked and
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
when you talk about folks who are
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
unbanked they are folks who are for
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason sometimes it's choice
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's inability or lack of
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
financial literacy they do not have
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal to set up bank accounts
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
and do things of that nature those folks
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
generally the department has always had
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
concerns with is that typically and this
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
is a gross generalization but typically
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the department's experience a lot of
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
times the folks who are unbanked are the
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
lower wage earners so as there has been
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
this heightened concern of lower wage
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
earners on a pay card being subject to
 
01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.789 align:start position:0%
earners on a pay card being subject to
fees

01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh that brings us to the second concern
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
so if the first is choice whether they
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
should have the choice or not the second
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
being fees
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
i would be clear that this
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
language in this says that they should
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
be able to withdraw one at least one
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
time per pay period for the full balance
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
of their pay without fee so if that's
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
happening that is no different than now
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
the idea that you should be able to go
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
and cash a check
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
without a fee at a financial institution
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
so the the language of the bill does say
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
that and the language of pay cards has
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
said that for some time
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
i would just point out that sometimes
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
the use of these pay cards and i did get
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
a question from one of the
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
representatives representative schmidt
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
had talked about the various programs
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
there are a whole host of pay card
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
programs or platforms out there the
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
department does not understand to have
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
an encyclopedic recall on how all of
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
them work some of them do have a lot of
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
fees and when i talk about fees they
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
talk about fees relative to transfers
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
fees relative to using them as debit
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
cards or other things of that nature but
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
this does say that they should at least
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
have a fee less opportunity for the
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
person to withdraw their full payment uh
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's very important in any instance in
 
01:03:27.039 --> 01:03:27.990 align:start position:0%
that's very important in any instance in
which

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
a pay card did not provide that it would
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
be in violation of this whether this
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
amendment goes forward or not or this
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill goes forward or not
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
the last concern that the department has
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
had and i think this somewhat speaks to
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative infantine your part
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
questions related to that language that
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
was inserted is when we testified in the
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
senate we did bring up that there have
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
been instances when we've dealt with pay
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
cards where the problem has been
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
accessed so the employer has a pay card
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh invite they have a pay card that they
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
give to their employees even if
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
employees might at present they're
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
choosing to be on the pay card and when
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
they go to use it
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
they can't it's not working and then
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
when they go to the pay card the the
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
they go to their employer they say hey i
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
can't get my payment the employer says
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
deal with the pay card company i i don't
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
deal with that you know i've paid it you
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
deal with the pay card company sometimes
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
then they go deal with the pay card
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
company they're like well there's a
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
problem with what your employer has done
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
or not done and i think the intent of
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
the language here i understand what
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that it's somewhat
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
broad but the intent of the language
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
here is to just make very plain that if
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
there was a late payment because the
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
payment process did not work
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh the employer would be expected to
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
make that individual
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
whole and timely they should be doing it
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
timely we've had these examples or
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
instances in which someone has been
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
waiting for a week or two weeks or three
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
weeks for the pay card stuff to sort
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
itself out and the person is at that
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
point going unpaid uh for some
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
significant period of time so certainly
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
i think the language could be you know
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
tightened or made more explicit in what
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but i think that was
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
what the intent was and i don't mean to
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
speak for the senator but i believe that
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
when senator soucy was looking to add an
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to the initially offered
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
language that was the concern was this
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
access the idea that there have been
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
instances in which employees have said i
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
can't get the pay card to work the
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
employer's not helping them because
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
they're saying hey i've offloaded that i
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
have a vendor that handles that deal
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
with them and then the vendor is not we
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
cannot do anything to the vendor if the
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
payment is late the department of labor
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
has no ability to say to the vendor pay
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
them on time or get it fixed so that's
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
kind of where it's come up as a concern
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take any questions and
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
again i would just note that
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate some of the changes
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
that have been made to this to really
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that the employer is expected to
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
make the payment timely and make the
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
individual whole if there are pro
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
processing problems
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative c
 
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.150 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative c
work

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman thank
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
you for
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
testifying on this
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
my question goes back a number of years
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
similar bills in the past and
 
01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.589 align:start position:0%
similar bills in the past and
frequently

01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
the issues you alluded to where pay
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
cards have caused problems particularly
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
for this unbanked segment
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the workforce
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
and my question is
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
based on the department's experience
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
with those problems how does it compare
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
with that same segment trying to deal
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
with caching checks in other words my
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
question is is it really the cases has
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
been suggested before that pay cards are
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
tend to have more problems than
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
say an unbanked person trying to get
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
their money from a check
 
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.430 align:start position:0%
their money from a check
or

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
is the issue really with the unbanked
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
situation rather than the means of
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
trying to pay them the biggest issues
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we've come across with pay cards
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking my turn with the
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
departments relatively the last eight
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
years typically what has come up as
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
problem has been fees but i do want to
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
be very clear that the fees have not
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
been in the environment of the person
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
was not able to get their
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
payment without a fee at least once it's
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
that they've used the card the cards
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
offer a number of different you can make
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
transfers you can use it as a debit card
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
you can do a lot of different things
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
with these cards that are sometimes
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
convenient but there are costs to those
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
conveniences and what we have had is we
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
have had instances in which employees
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
have used the cards they've incurred a
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
number of fees and then when they've
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
dealt to with us we've looked at it and
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
said okay well you were using it though
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
that way so it wasn't necessarily there
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
were a lot of fees uh whether you know
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
they knew that there were going to be
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
all those fees up front some of the
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
literature is better than others when
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
you look at certain of what they get
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
when they're onboarded
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
but again so we have not seen there be
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
fee problems in the sense of not being
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
able to get the payment at least once if
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
that's what they wanted to do without a
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
fee the other problem has been a choice
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
where presently the law says that you
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
cannot compel someone to use a pay card
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
what we have run across in several
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
instances and it's mainly been employers
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
who are through multiple jurisdictions

01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
choice to elect a paper check

thank you that was very helpful
um

01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
mr ogden um
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many
 
01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:47.749 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many
approximate

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
approximate
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
pay cards are out there how many
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
employers or how many employees are on a
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
pay card situation i don't i don't have
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
second on line 18
 
01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
second on line 18
17

01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
17
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
in such a situation the employer shall
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
be liable for late payment of wages
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
it means that it would be considered a
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
late payment so if
 
01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.789 align:start position:0%
late payment so if
if

01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
the person was supposed to get paid on
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
friday when they go to use the pay card
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
on friday it does not work if they're
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
not able to access the the wages friday
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
starting the next day they are now
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's a late payment we would consider
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
them liable for those late wages and
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
once they're liable for late wages it
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be expected that they make them
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
whole in the immediate that they don't
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
wait till the next pay period that they
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
don't wait till the next pay cycle that
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
they say
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
person should have been paid friday i
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
need to make them whole as soon as i'm
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.269 align:start position:0%
aware of it
but

01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
there aren't any um i have a follow-up
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
please brian
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you that does not mean that
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's a is there a labor department
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
fine is that liable is there uh are they
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
liable for again for
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
fees that they incurred for maybe a
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
an automatic payment
 
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.149 align:start position:0%
an automatic payment
uh

01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
liable in the sense of being used in
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
this section of statute would be liable
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
one for the the payment the actual wages
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
two there would be a civil penalty for a
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
late payment so in an instance in which
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
an employer does not correct that
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
um and make them uh whole on that day
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh they it would be a late payment with
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
a civil penalty of up to twenty five
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abalone
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just for
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
clarification when you say late payment
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
for wages that doesn't mean if they're
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
on friday you know their mortgage comes
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
out of that debit card and it bounces
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
would the employer be liable for any
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
fees occurred with that
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
payment not going through being returned
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you just
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be liable for
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
they'd be liable for the wages the sum
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
total of the wages if they're uh
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not just explain the
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
apologies representative just explain in
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
terms of the so friday they can't access
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
their money to transfer to their
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
personal account and their mortgage
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
bounces that afternoon the bank assesses
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
the fee the mortgage company assesses a
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
fee would the employer be liable for
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
those fees
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
if they came to you and said because he
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
can't pay his mortgage because he didn't
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
get his pay right so there's a 50 fine
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
or 20 you know a fee or something for
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
late payments or if it was a direct
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
deposit right from his debit card or his
 
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.229 align:start position:0%
deposit right from his debit card or his
card

01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
to the bank and it bounces
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a fee plus a late fee is that
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
they could be liable for the fees
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
relative to what the bank is charging
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
them but not if they owed the money to
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
someone else and that other entity was
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
then also charging them the fine if that
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
fee if that makes sense
 
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.350 align:start position:0%
fee if that makes sense
when

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah when we do a wage adjustment now if
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
if you're if the bank is finding you
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
we're finding you this amount of money
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
because your account was overdrawn we do
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
attribute that to the employer but if
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
the person's not able to make their
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
payment to their landlord
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
and then the landlord charges them a
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
late fee that would not necessarily
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
carry through but any of the fees
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
directly charged through the account
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
just checking eyes everyone
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you deputy
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner it was nice to hear from
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you for responding to my email
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
i had sent everybody in the committee uh
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
the latest
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
issue that i saw with pay cards
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
ask hank had to go out and find out what
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
happened to a woman's full account
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
she had
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
found that every transaction that she
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
made took a three dollar fee
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
and so she decided to let it build up
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
suddenly disappeared and i know that
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
they had to deal with the pay card
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
company they're not exactly sure what
 
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
company they're not exactly sure what
happened

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant that she was working for
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
refused to discuss it with her
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
the money that she earns at a restaurant
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
is her money
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
and if it isn't paid if the pay card
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
does something with it that the
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant's still responsible to pay
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
her yes
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
correct absolutely
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
i had thought that this issue was closed
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it's just getting
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
moved aside new pay cards being used
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
new fees on some of these things
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
overdraft fees that are happening to
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
people because they're taking off a fee
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
each time
 
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.590 align:start position:0%
each time
um

01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
what how many how many issues do you see
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
coming to you directly from employees
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
on pay cards
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative we do not see a lot of
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
pay card issues uh come to us again as i
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
was speaking uh to representative
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
seaworth's question uh
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
it does not come up that often and when
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
it comes up it's principally in the
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
realm of they were not they were forced
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
to use it
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's usually been the issue that has
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
come up at least in the years that i've
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
been with the department we have had
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
instances i know the case you're talking
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
about the case you're talking about
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately she did recover all the wages
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
but certain of the fees she was accruing
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
were related to transfers she was trying
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
to make or as you're saying one-time
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
purchases which again there are fees
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
depending upon how you want to use
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
these cards but it was not an instance
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
in which she was not able to get her
 
01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
in which she was not able to get her
payment

01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
and not have a fee you know she could go
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
on payday and pull her payment that was
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
not the problem the problem was
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
transfers and then also purchases and as
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
she was doing that the the fees were
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
piling up to your point
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.709 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:46.719 --> 01:14:48.070 align:start position:0%
um
clearly

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
a people who are having a problem with
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
this don't understand the process really
 
01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.510 align:start position:0%
this don't understand the process really
well

01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
what happens when a pay card is
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
instituted by a company do they have to
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
explain everything that happens with
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
that pay card to that employee so they
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
can understand clearly when the fees are
 
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.830 align:start position:0%
can understand clearly when the fees are
taken

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
because all the fees are different
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
depending on the pay card
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
i can imagine it can be very complex
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
present law does provide that they are
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to receive a disclosure they
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
are supposed to receive a statement
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
disclosing those fees the nature of
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
those fees and the magnitude of those
 
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.390 align:start position:0%
those fees and the magnitude of those
fees

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
we know that some of the problems that
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
are happening are with people who are
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
unbanked obviously um they may have a
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
problem with language they may have a
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
problem with reading uh handing somebody
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
a document that says you're going to be
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
charged for this
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
they might not fully understand is there
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
any way to assure
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
that it is a full understanding of the
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there is a way um
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
i think that that would be very
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
difficult in terms of putting into law i
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
think that it would be hard to say that
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh someone you'd have to be you know or
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
we at that point considering capability
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
capacity competency in terms of
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
measuring those things i don't i
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
understand exactly the concern you're
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
identifying i don't know it's certainly
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
not addressed in present law and i don't
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
another question for you um
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
so if a situation occurred where there's
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
a technical or processing deficit on a
 
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
a technical or processing deficit on a
friday

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
friday
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
the person could not access their money
 
01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:32.630 align:start position:0%
the person could not access their money
the

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with the pay card which
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
no one can figure out
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
at the present time
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
that individual by this if this law
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
passes would have the ability to demand
 
01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:46.950 align:start position:0%
passes would have the ability to demand
um

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
direct deposit cash or a check
 
01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.950 align:start position:0%
direct deposit cash or a check
um

01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
um
immediately

01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna hear
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
that at two o'clock when everyone else
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
gets paid another way and this
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
individual cannot use their card
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to hear the employer say
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
at four o'clock i'm not going to do that
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
because if i pay you now and then the
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
pay card kicks in for some reason over
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
the weekend on monday you've been paid
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
twice i'm not gonna pay you you'll just
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
have to wait three two or three days
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have that situation
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
are we i believe again not to speak for
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
the senator but i believe that as part
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the intent of this language is at
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
present that is one of the issues with
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
the pay cards is that
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
a problem comes up and then the employer
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
says i've already dealt with this
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
through the pay card company so i am not
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with it in the present they wait
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
for it to sort out and sometimes it can
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
take days weeks to sort out and the
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
person's gone unpaid or late paid
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
throughout that time so if an employer
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
decides that they're gonna use a pay
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
card and there's a hiccup for no matter
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
what reason
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
they'll be responsible first they can
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
deal with the pay card company later
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
correct and one thing that i would also
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
just want to point out is
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
with a check it works the same way if
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
presently an employer had a problem
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
paying with checks
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
we would look at the employer to correct
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
that not say well the bank's going to
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
fix it or the bank messed up my payroll
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
account we would look to the employer to
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
fix that in the immediate i think what
 
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
we've experienced sometimes is
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
again not a not on a lot of instances
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
but we have experienced issues with the
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
pay cards where there has been that lag
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
and it has really been detrimental to
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
the employees affected
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
for debbie commissioner representative
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
sullivan and followed by uh abuelani
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
have there been instances where you have
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
um levied fines against
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
companies that
 
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
companies that
are

01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
i believe so yes i can check to confirm
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
that but yes if there was a late payment
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
there would have been fines and late
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
payment is one of the instances in which
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's not a first a warning so when
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's come up i'm certain there have
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you again deputy
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner so um under it says 915 due
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
to a technical processing defect
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
so say the they put in their wrong pin
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
number and this is completely user error
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't reset for 24 hours and
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
they can't access their money till say
 
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.229 align:start position:0%
they can't access their money till say
monday

01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
monday
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's possible in the given scenario that
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
could fall under the language that's
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner for taking my
 
01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner for taking my
question

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that this is a this
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
becomes a
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
a requirement for for employment
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
that uh if you if you don't if you're
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
unbanked for whatever reason
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
and you don't want to payroll if you
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay a real card because
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you're concerned about all the
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
fees and what else could happen you
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes you are correct in the sense of
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
presently uh individuals can say that
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
they want to check
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh and they can
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
be paid by a check
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
with the language put forth in the
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
an employer could say i'm going to pay
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
via direct deposit and it would be in
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
instances in which the person does not
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
take direct deposit or cannot take
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
direct deposit they could then the
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
employer then could say well you're
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
being paid via pay card
 
01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.669 align:start position:0%
being paid via pay card
well

01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
so if if the reason i don't i can't take
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
direct deposit is because the the
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
regular banks have such high minimum
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
monthly balances
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
i can't afford to have a hundred dollars
 
01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.350 align:start position:0%
i can't afford to have a hundred dollars
200

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the account and maybe like i don't
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
have a credit union near me that i could
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
join where they where they don't have
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
these outrageous fees and requirements
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh like can i take the debit card and
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
get my sister or my my neighbor to cash
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
it for me
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
i probably can't do that like i could
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.679 --> 01:21:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
payroll cards are as put forth here they
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to go to a financial
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
institution convenient to the place of
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
employment and do one
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
felis withdrawal
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
and at banks where you don't have an
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
account they often charge you seven
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
eight ten dollars to cash that check
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
that that is drawn on the bank would
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
that be the case with this payroll card
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
so under present law employers are
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to ensure that they have an
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
arrangement with a bank so that even if
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
individuals did not have an account they
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to a fee
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
that should in under
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation it's to extend that to
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
pay cards that again individuals would
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
be able to present them
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
even if they don't have a particular
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
relationship with a bank that is the way
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
that this is intended to work if that's
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
not happening or doesn't happen that
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of this of this
 
01:22:18.239 --> 01:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of this of this
language

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
and if the bank
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's designated is not convenient to
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
the employee and the employee goes to
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
another bank
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
if the employee decides to go to an
 
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.310 align:start position:0%
if the employee decides to go to an
inconvenient

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
inconvenient
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
location that would not be a violation
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
the requirement is that there be a
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
convenient location
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
there has to be a convenient location
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
for the individual to do this if they
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
cannot do that because it's it doesn't
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
exist then the employer is in violation
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
if the individual decides to go
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
someplace else and incurs a fee that
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
would not be in violation of this
 
01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.510 align:start position:0%
would not be in violation of this
statute

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um line 22
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the second page
 
01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.229 align:start position:0%
of the second page
um

01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
actually starts on line 20 if anybody
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
wants to read it shall result in wage
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
payments via payroll card um are we
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
mandating payroll cards if there's only
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
an electronic means or should it be up
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
to the employer to provide another an
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
or they should be locked into a payroll
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
card there you would not be locking
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
employ employers would be able to say
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
i'm paying via check or they could say
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
in practice i think how this would work
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
is the employer could elect to say i
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
want to pay everyone via a direct
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
deposit if there are individuals who
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
cannot take it under direct deposit they
 
01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.550 align:start position:0%
cannot take it under direct deposit they
could

01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
mandate uh a payroll card if the
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
employer does not want to use a payroll
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
card they could then say okay i can't
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
direct deposit this person i'll give
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
them a check
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be necessarily forcing the
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
employer to use the payroll card you'd
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
be forcing the employee to use the
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman infantine vice
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
chairman seaworth and committee members
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
um my name is pete iceberg i'm vice
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
president of government relations for
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
adp which is the largest payroll company
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the nation we pay one out of every
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
six u.s workers
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
we think this bill will help both
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
workers and employers it'll help
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
employers meet their wage and and our
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
law obligations to pay workers on time
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
it can be impossible for employers to
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
pay workers on time you know in
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
situations where there's physical
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
delivery problems like bad weather which
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
is not unusual here
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
or the recent government shutdowns
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
related to covet electronic payments
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
eliminate this concern
 
01:25:23.679 --> 01:25:25.189 align:start position:0%
eliminate this concern
it

01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:25.430 align:start position:0%
it
you was

01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
you was
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
really again impossible to deliver paper
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
paychecks when the businesses themselves
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
were shut down the employees were at
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
home how do you get paper paychecks to
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
the people who need that they can't get
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
to the bank
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
so if there's a snowstorm on payday god
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
forbid no one is getting paid and that's
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
so this this fixes that employers should
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
be able to offer the choice of direct
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
deposit or payroll cards electronic
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
payments through direct deposit or
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
payroll cards is an efficient reliable
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
and cost-saving move for employers in
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire a major improvement over
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
paper checks for employees
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
again most states already allow this 29
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
states permit electronic wage payments
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
including maine and massachusetts
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
employers that prefer to offer paper
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
payroll checks would certainly be free
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
to continue doing so so for example if
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
an employer had a collective bargaining
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
agreement they would probably just
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
continue offering paper paper checks
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
until the union uh you know agreed
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise and and people are used to
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
this already most payments are already
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
electronic virtually all government
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
payments are electronic such as tax
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
refunds unemployment insurance social
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
security nutrition assistance
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
disability and so on those are all
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
electronic 93
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
of american workers are already paid via
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
direct deposit
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
so we're just talking about that last
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
seven percent
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
and government employees are generally
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
all paid electronically so this is
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
something that's you know really only a
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
problem in the private sector
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
payroll cards have evolved to be much
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
better for consumers than um you know
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard uh we also saw you know
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
negative accounts in the past i think
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's been addressed now this is a
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
debit card like any other so you can use
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
it for spending at any retail
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
establishment and get cash back you can
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
walk into any bank that has a visa or
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
mastercard logo walk up to the teller
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
ask them for the full amount there's no
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
fee for that
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
so very easy to transact
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh you basically you really have to go
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
out of your way to to pay a fee to use
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
this card uh you know the only the only
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
cost typically is to use an out of
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
network atm and we make it pretty easy
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
to find in network atms through you know
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
just on your phone app whereas and
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
where's my free atm very easy to find
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
there are free withdrawals at lots of
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
major retailers uh walmart ninety
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the population live within
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's five miles of a walmart
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
walgreens cvs target rite aid circle k
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
costco all those major retailers they
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
have those all point
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
atms and there's free transactions there
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
card holders can use payroll cards
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere they would use a check
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
maybe with the uh
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
exception that you couldn't just sign it
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
over to somebody else your your spouse
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
your friend something like that
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know so that that that's a problem
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
but you know it enables people to do you
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
know free online bill payment
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is a functional bank
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
account uh you do internet shopping you
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't do otherwise if you're using
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know paper checks uh very
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
importantly there are the visa and
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
mastercard protections from fraud
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
in in dispute resolution so that's a
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
huge advantage for folks that are today
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
are in the cash economy
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
they cannot be overdrafted there are no
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
nsf fees on these payroll cards
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
they often include free savings accounts
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
and additional cards for family members
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a good choice for people with
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
kids in college just want to give them a
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
spending account with a certain amount
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
each month
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
and frankly paper checks are pretty bad
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
choices for workers who have to present
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
their check you know assuming they have
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
a bank account and wait for that check
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
to clear
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
those without bank accounts typically
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay check cashing fees
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then carry their full paycheck in
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
cash which is subject to loss or theft
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
most recently earlier availability with
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
electronic wage payments many banks now
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
credit electronic payroll payments a day
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
or two before payday
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
and electronic wage statements the pay
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
stubs are are generally also available
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
before payday so this is better for
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
workers and for employers we see it as a
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
matter of when not if
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
european workers for example haven't
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
seen a paper paycheck in decades
 
01:29:30.159 --> 01:29:31.350 align:start position:0%
seen a paper paycheck in decades
um

01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
i do want to respond to one question
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
that came up and that was related to the
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
unbanked this actually helps unbanked
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
folks they can't get a bank account
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
today because they can't walk into the
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
bank maybe they're undocumented but if
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
they can get a job you have to have a
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
social security number to get you know
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
to be employed but if you can get a job
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
the bank system relies on employers to
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
do the know your customer authentication
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
verification so
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
they can they can get a job they can get
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
a payroll card this is a functional bank
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
account that they could not get
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
before getting this job so they can
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
pay their bills electronically all that
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
good stuff
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
so it actually helps helps the
 
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.950 align:start position:0%
so it actually helps helps the
undocumented

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer your questions
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative cahill
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
i realized that adp is a predominant
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
handle of payroll but you're not the
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
only debit card in town
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
so could you speak to the possibility i
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
mean i've heard about people having fees
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
for balance inquiry
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
is that something that doesn't happen
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
with adp
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh correct yeah that doesn't happen we
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
basically that the list of fees have
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
gone down to pretty much zero the only
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
the only fee for adp i can say is uh if
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
you're using an out-of-network atm
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
um and again we make it pretty easy to
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up but again you you can only
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
speak for adp debit cards
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh that's true yeah so there are other
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
cards they have they have their own fee
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
disclosure statements and employers you
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
know if they they may choose a
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
a card arrangement with um adverse fees
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know some other states have um
 
01:31:10.159 --> 01:31:11.270 align:start position:0%
you know some other states have um
prohibited

01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
feed you know
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
account balance inquiry fees and things
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
like that so those little nuisance fees
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
if if they're concerned but usually that
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
sorts itself out in the marketplace
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
employers you know tend to to use the
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
best uh
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
systems that are out there
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
another follow-up another follow-up
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
and again the employers are the one
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
making the decision on which car which
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
payroll card to offer
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily consulting their
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
employees or how this is going to work
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
for them
um

01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
and and it's the the issue of the issue
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
of the direct deposit which i personally
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
have in my my 100 a year it shows up
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
right on times don't worry
 
01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.830 align:start position:0%
right on times don't worry
but

01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
isn't that isn't that something that's
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
less problematic if a person can have
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
that than the payroll cards we don't
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
hear about trouble with with the deposit
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
not getting there with your direct
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
deposit whereas payroll cards we refer
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
to litany of other complaints about them
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure understood the question it
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like there may be technical
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
problems with delays in payments on
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
payroll cards in payroll cards are seem
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
to be more problematic than okay than
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
direct deposit if you're able to manage
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
the direct deposit through perhaps one
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
of those credit unions that isn't as uh
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
greedy in their fees as a normal bank
 
01:32:25.679 --> 01:32:26.470 align:start position:0%
greedy in their fees as a normal bank
yeah

01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah i would say um
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
direct payroll cards are really the
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent of direct deposit
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the sense of
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh being um
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know problem free like the same they
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
they run on the same guard
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
the same systems as direct deposit so
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
the banking system um is is
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable it's the same the
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
problems come in with the confusion of
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
employees of you know where do i have my
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
pin where's my pin what's my password
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
how do i use this card can i take it
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
here can i take it there i i had a
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
question from a bank total that didn't
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
know what they were doing uh when i went
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
to ask them to you know cash that the
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
fee we've actually you know for example
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
published letters given letters to
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
employees saying you know just take this
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
to your teller if they give you any
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty it directs them to contact
 
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know corporate and let them you know
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
confirm that there's no fee associated
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
with this that kind of thing
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
so there are some there's some confusion
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
about sometimes how do i use this card
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um to you know the the deputy
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner's um
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
statement you know it really
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
we believe it it is a responsibility the
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
employer if an employee does have
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties you know regardless of what
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
the cause was to help them through that
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
final follow-up yes final fantasy this
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
is my final question so
 
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:40.790 align:start position:0%
is my final question so
okay

01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
so if you uh if you have the the card
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
or sorry if you have the check it
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
usually comes with a pay stub
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
and you can keep track of your hours and
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
your vacation time well how do you do
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
this with a debit card sure
 
01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.070 align:start position:0%
this with a debit card sure
um

01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
people who get uh payroll cards get the
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
same pay stub as anybody that gets a
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
check they just get it electronically
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
and again it's pretty employers um put
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
this on a secure kiosk and they keep
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
records forever so it's actually better
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
than you know having something printed
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
that you need to then keep track of
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
stuff in your pocket forget where you
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
put it you don't know where it is it's
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to be on that secure internet
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
portal forever whenever you need it back
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
10 years whatever
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
something like that but and it's fairly
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
easy to do also if an employee does want
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
to print that
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
the employers typically have a secure
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
printing area like a kiosk in the
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
employer's office where the employee can
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
just go and print their pay stubs if
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
they just want a printed pay stub but
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's all very easy and secure and
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
they this is how they interact with
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
employers generally anyway um through
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
those these employee portals for their
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
benefits and things like that
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
ah representative sullivan
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
it um occurs to me that you know when i
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
i get my direct deposits which i love
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know i i have no problem with that
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
but some folks do um
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
i can always check my bank account to
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
see if the money that was supposed to go
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
in actually did if i get a pay stub
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
and a uh
 
01:35:19.119 --> 01:35:20.870 align:start position:0%
and a uh
a

01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
payment card um how would i know how
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
much money is actually on that card and
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
if it matches the stub
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
sure yeah you would look at the pay stub
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
as you would a payroll check it has the
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
net pay amount that was credited to your
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
account and obviously you can also you
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
typically use your phone to check your
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
your you know bank
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh to see you know the amount that i
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a bank okay um it's just the
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
payroll card itself um yeah it comes
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
with uh an app that tracks your spending
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
and tracks deposits and things like that
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
so it's right on your phone
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
so you can see the amount that's
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
actually on the card itself at any time
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
does that make sense sorry i guess
 
01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.270 align:start position:0%
does that make sense sorry i guess
um

01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
so basically my uh my app would know
 
01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.629 align:start position:0%
so basically my uh my app would know
follow

01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:36:04.639 --> 01:36:05.910 align:start position:0%
follow
um

01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
my app
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to track exactly how much
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
money is left on my uh payroll card
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes right so yeah it'll show the deposit
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
it'll show any spending that you know
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
your purchase at starbucks it'll give
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
you a spending uh analysis over the past
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
month and things like that so it's
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually pretty helpful for just
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
financial management okay thank you
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
mr clark
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
um if a person doesn't have a phone how
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
would they get this information
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
um that person would probably use that
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you know employer kiosk to print
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
their paper pay stub or if they don't
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
have internet access at home or
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
something like that typically people
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
have internet access at home and can
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
look up their pay stub but if they don't
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
have that they can just use the kiosk at
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
the employer shop to to print their pay
 
01:36:51.199 --> 01:36:55.189 align:start position:0%
the employer shop to to print their pay
statement

01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
iceberg for taking the questions um
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
if a issue with adp
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
employer's account put it in yours and
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's a hiccup between your
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
company and the payroll card
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
would the employer be liable for that
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
under this
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem between adp the
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
payroll company and the card company
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
somehow resulting in no non-payment
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
correct or late payment or non-payment
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
or double payment or
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
any anything that falls within this
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
liable for late payment of wages yes the
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
employer would be reliable and that's
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
kind of the way the law works today
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
again as the department of labor
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned they really don't have
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
authority over all the payroll companies
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know in the nation so they wouldn't
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
be able to directly enforce wage and
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
error laws against the payroll card
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
companies or the payroll companies but
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
the employers responsible and the
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
payroll card companies and the payroll
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
companies themselves are liable to the
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
employer under contract you know so if
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
the employer sorts it out helps the
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
employee gets that solved and then goes
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
after the uh payroll company and says
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
what was the problem you need to
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative cahill actually this
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
question is for my colleagues who are on
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
the committee who are employers how many
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh comes directly from my payroll
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
company to myself
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions for uh
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
for example for most of the time
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
when i uh
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
my payday comes up
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
i take my card and i go to the bank near
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
my employer in nashua let's say
 
01:39:32.639 --> 01:39:33.430 align:start position:0%
my employer in nashua let's say
and

01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
one week there's a snowstorm and i live
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
in either
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
windham new hampshire or i live in
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
lowell massachusetts
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
how would i
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
could i take my car to a lowell bank
 
01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.350 align:start position:0%
could i take my car to a lowell bank
and

01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
how would i do it would i take it to the
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
cashier or would i put it into the
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
atm machine to try to get my pay and
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
would i
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
have to pay a fee
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
am i being clear sure
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i think so um
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
basically just how the how this works
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know if you have the card you're in
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
maybe another state or you're in maybe
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's a snowstorm the the pay is on
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
your card today so uh if you want to
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
actually convert that to cash because
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
you want to use cash for some reason yes
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
you'd walk up to the any bank teller of
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
any any bank
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's a visa affiliate or a mastercard
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
affiliate and just say can you give me
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
the full value on the card and they give
 
01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
the full value on the card and they give
that

01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
to you in full in cash or you can go to
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
any atm
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
and use that atm to get cash
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
if it's an out of network atm there may
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
be a fee
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
for doing that but again we make it
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to find atms where there's
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
with better in-network
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it just occurred
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
your company takes good care of its
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
people takes care of the people who are
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
your customers
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased to see that
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
but it's clear that there are some
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
companies that aren't as
 
01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.229 align:start position:0%
companies that aren't as
high

01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
in regard do you think it's time to
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
regulate the industry
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
to regulate the payroll card industry
 
01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.109 align:start position:0%
to regulate the payroll card industry
um

01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
i guess it would be a question you know
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
if there have been you know serious
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
abuses that haven't been able to be
 
01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.149 align:start position:0%
abuses that haven't been able to be
resolved

01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
um then you know perhaps i guess i'm not
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
sure i would be able to comment on that
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
well you you said it about seven percent
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
of uh people fall into that and don't
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
receive yeah um that seven percent is
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
likely to be the person who is new to
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
the country who doesn't speak the
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
language who is unbanked they're the
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
ones that really really need extra help
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
with this and could be taken for a ride
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
um the person that i had referenced to
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
everybody in an email
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
she was an intelligent person
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
worked full-time went to college took
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
care of her kids and she still fell into
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
this trap didn't even know enough to
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
come to the labor department for help
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me that maybe there
 
01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:14.550 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me that maybe there
are

01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
disreputable companies out there that
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
are giving your industry a very bad name
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
and perhaps it's time to regulate um but
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
i did have another question so you you
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
walk up to an atm
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
an approved one and this this is not
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily you but it could be any of
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
your your cohorts uh you ask for your
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
check amount
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
and there's a small fee on it um so you
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
take out
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
30 of it because you need some cash in
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
hand now when you withdraw some preps
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
the next week
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
not not on the same are you drawing from
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
the previous card and would there be a
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
charge on that or is every card uh
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
new or or you're building
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
an account it's so unclear
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good question thank you for
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
asking that um
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
an employee has issued a single payroll
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
card so that's their payroll card it
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
represents the payroll card account and
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
that is functionally equivalent to a
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
bank account
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
so the card doesn't change um just
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
amounts keep getting added to it as over
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
time the person works and so forth and
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
as they spend or you know withdraw money
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
from it it just gets taken out as
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
with a bank account
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
follow up but but what if you don't take
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
it all out this week
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
and another pay period happens and you
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
take out some that next week are you
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
charged a fee
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
oh um i think the the
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
the law here um guarantees that there is
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
at least one free transaction per pay
 
01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.550 align:start position:0%
at least one free transaction per pay
period

01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh to take out you know the amount up to
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
the full amount on the card
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
beyond that again if you're using outer
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
network atms then there may be fees
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
associated with subsequent withdrawals
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative warden thank you thank
 
01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:02.790 align:start position:0%
representative warden thank you thank
you

01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
the this bill would require that if an
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
employee loses
 
01:44:08.639 --> 01:44:09.430 align:start position:0%
employee loses
or

01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
destroys his or her payroll card that
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
the employer replaces within 24 hours
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
how does that work logistically do
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
employers have a stack of these or they
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
have to order it through you or through
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
the bank to have it mailed to the
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
employee as a replacement
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for asking that it's a
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
challenging issue um and we saw that was
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
amended in after the senate hearing
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and it is a challenge and essentially
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes we knew we do have to provide all
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
clients for example with um some
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
cards ready to go and those are instant
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
issue cards they don't have names
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
imprinted on them
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
so if anybody does have a problem
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
they've got a card stock and they can
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually just put it into their reader
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
and print it
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
communicate with the payroll company and
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
hand it to the employee
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
so they're logistically it works then
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know probably a week later the
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
person gets their imprinted card
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for the opportunity
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
happily turn it back over to the chair
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%

so he wanted to know that
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
um when they call senator erin hennessey

to introduce her bill senator thank you
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the committee
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm erin hennessey i'm the state senator
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
for district one which is the northern
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
half of grafton and all of coast county
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
i am here to introduce sb 345 which is
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
relative to youth unemploy youth
 
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.189 align:start position:0%
relative to youth unemploy youth
employment

01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
um this came out of discussions that i
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
had with um
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
mostly they were uh small um
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants in in the north country um
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
during the height of the pandemic time
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
when they got back into um
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
serving their clients but didn't have
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
enough employees and you would walk in
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
some place and there'd be a 14 year old
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
hostess there and he or she
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to see you because the
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
tables weren't cleared and
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
in our current law that 14 year old
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
can't clear away empty beer glasses
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
because of the way our laws are written
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
so this first section of this bill
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
deals with clearing up what is kind of
 
01:48:09.679 --> 01:48:10.390 align:start position:0%
deals with clearing up what is kind of
our

01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
probably old and outdated and in my
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussions with various different
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
departments i don't even think they're
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
aware of this language in the rsa so
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
it says that if you're 14 and you're
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
able to work you can clear
 
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.629 align:start position:0%
able to work you can clear
glasses

01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
glasses
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
from a table so it just helps out a lot
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
of restaurants that are looking for
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
workers and allows
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to expand the second
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
section deals with um 16 and 17 year old
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
workers only
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
and it it clears up a lot of confusion
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
um that i have heard from a lot of
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
different employers um other than
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners as well
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
and it it tries to just clarify how many
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
hours a
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
student or a 16 or 17 year old can work
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
during the week
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
and doesn't put limitations on if
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
there's four days of school that week or
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
three days of school that week
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then finally the third section um
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
also clears up what i found out to be
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
the most confusing section of our labor
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
laws right now and it
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the way um
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
rsa 276 a 13 right now related to night
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
work it says no youth who works more
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
than two nights a week past 8 p.m or
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
before 6 a.m shall be permitted to work
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
more than eight hours in any shift
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
during the particular week that's a very
 
01:49:28.719 --> 01:49:30.070 align:start position:0%
during the particular week that's a very
confusing

01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
law for not only students to keep track
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
of their hours but
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
employees so
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
the way section 3 is written written
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
right now helps to clarify that and i'd
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions and also
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's people behind me
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
that will answer them as well
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you senator uh mr vice chairman
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:49:50.719 --> 01:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
my colleagues that have been with me on
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
a while on this committee a while won't
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
be surprised i'm going right to the
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
night work
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the existing night work law as
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
obscure as it can be
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
if i were to boil it down i would say
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's a limitation on overtime on in
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
certain certain circumstances
 
01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:13.990 align:start position:0%
certain certain circumstances
the

01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
new version of that law is a hard limit
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
preventing anyone who's 17 from working
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
past 10 pm
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
to me that's a big change
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's a big restriction
 
01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:28.550 align:start position:0%
it's a big restriction
um

01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
and i wonder
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
what is behind driving you know
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a big risk restriction on
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
youth workers and i'm wondering what the
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
problem that's being addressed in that
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
besides simply the confusion with the
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it's it's a lot
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
of the confusion um people
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
often read the law to that no one could
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
work past eight o'clock at night even
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
though it doesn't say that um
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
additionally if you work
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
past eight o'clock on friday or saturday
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
night you can't work eight hours
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
more than eight hours in a shift
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
so friday and saturday night are not
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
school nights and kids should be able to
 
01:51:12.719 --> 01:51:13.750 align:start position:0%
school nights and kids should be able to
work

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
longer ships if they were like on
 
01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:18.390 align:start position:0%
longer ships if they were like on
weekends

01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%

has the liquid commission given a
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%

01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
and follow up mr chairman
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
line of
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
10-11 again with representative seaworth
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
we worked
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
quite a bit on this a few years ago um
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
if a 16 or 17 year old is in a work
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
study program you know goes to school
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
one week maybe goes to their
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
work study or something for following
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
week are they still only mandated for 35
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
hours to work that week when they could
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.239 --> 01:52:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think it would depend on how you read
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
this if if school isn't not in session
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
for them um because they're working that
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
week but i i i would
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
prefer that question somebody else who
 
01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:43.109 align:start position:0%
prefer that question somebody else who
would

01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
have the technical knowledge to answer
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay and follow up mr chairman follow up
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
the night work
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
student wants to work on you know wants
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
to be a lineman for episodes and
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
has to work overnight on certain jobs or
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
is on work release or right now work
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
study and you know there's a job that is
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
overnight on a friday night because he's
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
not in school that's over waking up and
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
wants to do that this would effectively
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question uh yes
 
01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
it would limit their work on a friday
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
night to 12 a.m and this was not in the
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
original bill the um senate committee
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
amended it to
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
say this
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative of attitude followed by
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
if a student gets out of work
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
at 3 p.m and they drive to their work
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
which in a rural area like grafton and
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
coast county can be upwards of 30
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
minutes or an hour away
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
they start their shift at 4 o'clock but
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
they get out at 10 pm on a school night
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
they're getting home at about 10 30 10
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
45 they still get ready for bed our own
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire university
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
suggests that a teenager gets 8 to 10
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
hours of sleep at night to be functional
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
in school
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
so if they meet that they're meeting or
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're sleeping from 11 p.m to 7 a.m
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
and immediately have to get up and get
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
ready for school at 8.
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
at what point during that interval was
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
the child supposed to do the two hours
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
of homework that they got to sign that
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
day in school um thank you for the
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
question uh i would just say that not
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
all of our students are alike and not
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
all of their family situations are alike
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
and some of our kids do 16 and this is
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds only do have to go
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
to work for many different reasons um
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
and i would also point out that a lot of
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
our students do co-curricular activities
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
like my daughter's in drama and she
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't get home until 10 o'clock at
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
night and has to figure out how to do
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
her um homework as well
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
when i listened to this bill's
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
introduction in the center commerce
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee and correct me if i'm wrong
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
but it looked like you referenced the
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
labor shortage as one of the motivators
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
for the introduction of the bill
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
and in discussions with this i've heard
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
well a student doesn't have to work
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
those 35 hours they can just work up to
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
that like you said a lot of
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances are different
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
but if employers see this nice new cap
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
for them to get more hours out of and
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
they schedule those kids for that do you
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
see those kids feeling pressure to work
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
those hours to keep that job instead of
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
voicing their concerns and saying i need
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
to pump the brakes on this because i'm
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
failing my classes because i can't do my
 
01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.350 align:start position:0%
failing my classes because i can't do my
homework

01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
homework
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the question so the
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
the current cap is 40 and a half hours
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's actually a higher cap
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
so it's a it would be a lower cap than
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
now follow-up
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at lines nine and ten
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh in any employer's predetermined
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
designated work week during which school
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
is in session for five days
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
what happens if it's only in school for
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
four days if there's a holiday
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
all bets are off
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question no that was
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
what this this portion of the bill tried
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify because there was a lot of
 
01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:11.669 align:start position:0%
to clarify because there was a lot of
confusion

01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
with for for student workers and for uh
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
employers about the current language and
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
four days of work four days of school or
 
01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
five days of school and how many hours
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
they may work so
 
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:24.390 align:start position:0%
they may work so
um

01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
this attempted to clear that up
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate i i i appreciate that
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
there certainly is confusion but this
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
leaves it sort of vague in that what
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's like the law doesn't apply
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
if it's if they're not in school for
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
five days so i'm not sure we've answered
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for sorry sorry thank you
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
for that question that is for summer
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
time um or or or breaks when school is
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
not in session
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
then this would not apply you see
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i apologize mr chair i misstated our
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
current cap is 48 hours and not 41.5
 
01:57:03.599 --> 01:57:10.550 align:start position:0%
current cap is 48 hours and not 41.5
hours

01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
with reference to the night work section
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
do i understand this correctly that um
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
during summertime
 
01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:24.390 align:start position:0%
during summertime
um

01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
where this section would still apply
 
01:57:27.599 --> 01:57:28.709 align:start position:0%
where this section would still apply
uh

01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
no youth
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
would be able to work later than 10
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock on
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
a sunday through thursday
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that it's
 
01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.950 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that it's
summer

01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question and i have
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
to look
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'd have to look at the um
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
276 a
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
12 or whatever is above it just to
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
confirm that but i will get you that
 
01:57:51.520 --> 01:58:02.950 align:start position:0%
confirm that but i will get you that
answer

01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks for taking
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
if i'm reading this right
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:18.830 align:start position:0%
under current law
miners

01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
miners
 
01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.629 align:start position:0%
miners
uh

01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
15 year olds
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed to work in lounge
 
01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:27.830 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed to work in lounge
areas

01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
but if this goes through
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to work in lounge areas
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily to pick up glasses
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
it just
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
frees them up to work in lounge areas
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it allows 14
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
and 15 year olds to clean tables remove
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
empty containers and glasses and assist
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
in stocking
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
in those areas
 
01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.709 align:start position:0%
in those areas
but

01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
you're doing away with this section that
 
01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.709 align:start position:0%
you're doing away with this section that
says

01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
15 year olds uh
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
may be employed in dining areas
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
and miners
 
01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
and miners
uh

01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
not less than 16 would be
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to be employed in lounge areas
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
would this open up
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
15 year old
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
15 year olders to be able to work not
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
only to pick up glasses but to do other
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
work in the lounge area thank you for
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
the question so a lot of
 
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
establishments have a dining area and a
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
lounge area and if they have both then
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
14 and 15 year olds would be able in
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
those areas to clean tables remove empty
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
containers and glasses and assist in
 
01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:42.629 align:start position:0%
containers and glasses and assist in
stocking

01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
stocking
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question and i
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
don't know what other activities you
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
think they would be able to do in a
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
lounge area
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
what other areas that 15 year olds were
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do in lounge areas before
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
it had to be 16 year olds that wipes
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
that out
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
this it just pertains to what is written
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
there is miners not less than 14 years
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
of age may be employed to clean tables
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
remove empty containers and glasses and
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
assist in stocking
 
02:00:15.599 --> 02:00:17.589 align:start position:0%
assist in stocking
yeah

02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
i sorry i don't understand your question
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
are you trying to find out whether or
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
not they'd be able to serve alcohol or
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
not is that where your question is going
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
deal with alcohol but
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
they were
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to do something that 15 year
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
olds weren't allowed to do under current
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
law that's the way i read it
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
has that
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
has there been a change
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
for 15 year olds
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
senator you're welcome to answer if you
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
can if you
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't open up
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
16 year olds to do anything else that
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
they weren't allowed to do before and it
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't open
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
up anything that 14 and 15 year olds
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to do before other than
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
to clean tables remove empty
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
containers and glasses and assist in
 
02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:09.669 align:start position:0%
containers and glasses and assist in
stocking

02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
stocking
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's an avalanche followed by agent
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just for
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
clarification with 16 year olds may be
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
employed in lounge areas they're
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
lowering that to 14 years old and taking
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
out the ability
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that they're not allowed
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
to serve and that's why i asked the
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
question early to make sure that the 14
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
year olds would be able to be in
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
possession of
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
classes that we have residual liquor in
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
them and things like that when they were
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning those tables
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes they
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be able to clear empty glassware
 
02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.270 align:start position:0%
would be able to clear empty glassware
or

02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.950 align:start position:0%
or
residual

02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
residual
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
beverages and be allowed in lounge areas
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
followed by proud
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um if the main
 
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.149 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um if the main
crux

02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
crux
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to eliminate some of the
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
confusing language
 
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.189 align:start position:0%
confusing language
and

02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
minors to clear glasses off the tables
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
would there be resistance to the
 
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
forthcoming amendment
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
that would move
 
02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
the maximum hours that a student is
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to work
 
02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
allowed to work
when

02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
school is in session five days a week to
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
24 hours
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
and set the maximum amount of time or
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
the maximum hour that they were able to
 
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
work on a school night to 8 p.m to
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
better ensure that that child is able to
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
get more sleep
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
do their chores do their homework and be
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
better prepared for school the following
 
02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:31.669 align:start position:0%
better prepared for school the following
day

02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think there
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
would be resistance i don't think every
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
kid even though school may be in session
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
five days a week has the same school
 
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.070 align:start position:0%
five days a week has the same school
calendar

02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
some of our students have half days of
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
school and go to work full-time or 35
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
hours a week or what have you
 
02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:47.510 align:start position:0%
hours a week or what have you
um

02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i think every individual for 16 and
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
17 year old their situation is different
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
and like i said
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
we don't resist the uh restrict the
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
amount of hours on our kids that do
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
and so if they're not doing those and
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
they're choosing to work instead i don't
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
think a lower amount of hours is
 
02:03:06.719 --> 02:03:09.189 align:start position:0%
think a lower amount of hours is
relevant

02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
i understand your point about
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities um are you
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
aware of co-curricular activities that
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
um take up to 35 hours a week
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:25.669 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
especially if you're on more than one
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
team and
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
and a band
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um regarding the
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
night work section uh comparing it to
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
what it replaced what it replaced said
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
that it applies until 6am
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the new language doesn't have that
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
so it's unclear to me
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
whether someone would have to clock out
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
at midnight and clock back in at 12 15
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
or if they have to wait till dawn or
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
what the intent is there
 
02:04:01.199 --> 02:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
what the intent is there
yes

02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
no i don't know
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator

commission thank you
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you representative
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
infantine um just in terms of uh to be
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
clear weak the department of labor can't
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
speak to the first portion as was
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
referenced by the senator that would be
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission who would or
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
should or could speak to that in terms
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
of section two the two things we just
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
was in addition to raising the cap of 30
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
hours to 35 it's also eliminating the
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
more than six consecutive days and i
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear on that because
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
we had not seen or spoken to this
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
amendment this amendment was made after
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the public hearing at senate uh so
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
we just want to be very clear that in
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
addition to raising the cap during a
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
week from 30 to 35 hours
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
raising the idea that individuals could
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
work seven days consecutively or these
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
youth could work seven days
 
02:05:57.599 --> 02:05:58.950 align:start position:0%
youth could work seven days
consecutively

02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
consecutively
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
representatives are some
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
responsive to some of the concerns that
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative adjudant had brought up
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
the most calls that we get on youth
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
labor for uh
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
night work is the idea that people don't
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
believe that their children should be
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
working past a certain hour that's
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
always been a problem in my opinion
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
humble opinion relative to the existing
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
law is the existing law of night work it
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
does set inside this limitation that if
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
an individual youth was to work past
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
eight o'clock there would then be
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
ramifications that the employer would
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of and i do think to
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
the senator's point that has led some
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
employers in practice to just say i'm
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
not going to have a kid work past eight
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
but to be clear present law would allow
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
a kid to work entirely through the night
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
and that has been the bulk of the calls
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
that we get on night work is parents
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
calling us and saying my kid's working
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
at 11 o'clock that's not
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
allowed right and it is allowed um so i
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that that that's
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
really uh the calls that we get on night
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
work i can't speak to um i had heard
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer or hard
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to how restrictive this
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be to certain employers i don't
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
know how they do their staffing
 
02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer any questions if
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
folks have questions relative to the
 
02:07:13.679 --> 02:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
folks have questions relative to the
legislation

02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
again section 8 9 10 11 from the
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
30 to 35 hours in the six executive days
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
if child if the student is enrolled in a
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
work study program they go to school one
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
week and they're on their job the next
 
02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.950 align:start position:0%
week and they're on their job the next
week

02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
do you see a problem with this being
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
changed for
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
working six context working six
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
executive days or 40 hours per week
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
how we would presently apply that is
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
would we
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
presently apply it if it's if school is
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
in session or if there's a vacation week
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's where we wouldn't look at the
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
internship or externship type of
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
environment as not being in school so
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
therefore the hours
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
are are elevated so i mean if that's
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
something that the committee wants to
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
consider they certainly could uh but
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
presently we would look at the situation
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is that if the kid
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
if it's not a vacation week the the kid
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
is in school so the hour limitations
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
would apply representative cahill and i
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
apologize that reminds me of the
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
question that representative cahill
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
brought up i do think that that is
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
something to consider that as presently
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
drafted where it says school is in
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
session for five days if school was not
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
in session for five days you would not
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
have the 35 hour cap you would instead
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
default to the cap which says 48 hours
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that's in 276 a11 which says
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the pres any of the
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
provisions in a4
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
you have a hard cap at 48 hours so we
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
would look at a4 and we would say okay
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
school was in session school was not in
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
session for five days therefore the 35
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
hours doesn't apply
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then you would default to 276 a11
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
which would be the uh 48 hours
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i apologize that i
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
would offer
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
is that in terms of the uh i can echo
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
the center senator sentiments that
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
individual employers have contacted us
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
and saying the sliding scale that was
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
introduced in 2018 was difficult to work
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
with the sliding scale being that if
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
school was in session for four days they
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
could do 40 and a quarter if it was
 
02:09:32.550 --> 02:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
three or less they could do 48 employers
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
typically told us they did not leverage
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
the flexibility provided by that because
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
it was difficult for them to account for
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
how many days was the kid in school on a
 
02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:41.750 align:start position:0%
how many days was the kid in school on a
given

02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
given
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
you gotta finish up with episode avalani
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:09:57.599 --> 02:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:58.560 --> 02:09:59.669 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
my first question was related to that
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
section we were just discussing on line
 
02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.510 align:start position:0%
section we were just discussing on line
11.

02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
11.
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
um to me
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
this language about the six consecutive
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
days limit which is being
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
repealed isn't that redundant with the
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
day of rest
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
legislation which applies universally
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
not just to
 
02:10:22.079 --> 02:10:25.350 align:start position:0%
not just to
teens

02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
if if an employer was trying to employ a
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
teenager during the school year
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
for seven days
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
in a week
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't that
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
fall under the day of rest
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
section of our rsas
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes i do i see your point i do think
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that that could present as a a
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition on that type of staffing
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up which is
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
um not quite related
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to the night work you mentioned
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
that most of the problems
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
had to deal with confusion people
 
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe the law prohibited things
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't or the other way the
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
employer not understanding what the
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition means to them
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
are there situations
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
and how common are they where the law is
 
02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
presumably intended is the issue
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
that in other words employers who are
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
pushing the limit with
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
after hours and overtime that
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
the real issue is
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
too long shifts running too late at
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
night or would you say
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
that almost entirely the issue is
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
confusion with the law and people
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
wondering why it hasn't put a limit on
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
the hours
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's the latter i think that the
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
when we talk about night work or we try
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
and explain
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
why there could or should be something
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
such as night work i think the real
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
concern is what representative adjudant
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
brought up this idea that
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
people or kids in school should be
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
having enough rest to be able to show up
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
to school the next day and perform and i
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
think the existing law has been
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
confusing to that because again you
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
could have kids work all night every
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
night so long as they're not working
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
shifts longer than eight hours
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
so that's always been something that i
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
think rang is a little confusing to
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
folks because they were saying how is
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
this preventing the problem and again i
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
think in a general sense the problem
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
being people think that youth should be
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
going home going to bed and being able
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
to wake up to go to school the next day
 
02:12:40.159 --> 02:12:41.030 align:start position:0%
to wake up to go to school the next day
well

02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you you got to move this along yes
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
so i want to echo it was an earlier
 
02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
so i want to echo it was an earlier
question

02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
to your understanding though the night
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
work section is not related to school
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
being in session it's a general
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
prohibition based on age so it applies
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
equally during the summer as it would
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
during the school
 
02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:01.350 align:start position:0%
during the school
that's year

02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's year
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
and just the last thing i would say is i
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
am going to confirm i'm going to look at
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
that day of rest issue and i'll respond
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the committee i just want to make
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
sure i'm not misstating that i'll look
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
at the day of rest whether that serves
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
the same purpose as the six consecutive
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
days news about lenny
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner um
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
striking out sections b and c how would
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers in terms of our
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
application a lot of homeschoolers has
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
been that if the district in which they
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
reside is in session we consider them to
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
i any additional questions
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
02:13:48.079 --> 02:13:49.189 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
ogden

02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
ogden
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
um i agree that it's been very confusing
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
and we haven't helped matters much with
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.599 --> 02:14:04.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i think the confusion is was
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
made worse in our last effort and this
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't help a lot either
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
i i think there should be a bright line
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
at perhaps nine o'clock on school nights
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
instead of ten
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
and uh would it be possible would it be
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
sensible to say that this
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh own that little supply during the
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
school year
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has um
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
a holiday they could do a little bit
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
more work around the house or get ready
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
for that s.a.t
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh whatever they're just having it's
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
during the school year you can't work
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
past nine o'clock on a week night
 
02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:43.510 align:start position:0%
past nine o'clock on a week night
or

02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm fine with midnight on or if
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have school but during the
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
school year
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
september or august through
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
june would that be easier to understand
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
because i think many of your
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
incidents you find out after the fact
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the error the violation has
 
02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:04.390 align:start position:0%
that the error the violation has
occurred

02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
i i understand your point representative
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
i do think that that is a policy
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
decision in terms of if you think it
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
should be specifically stated towards
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
school i do think that that comes up and
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
that the employers are looking for
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility on those uh summer vacations
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
on those weeks in which there's vacation
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a sensible thing to work
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
on and look to but it's ultimately a
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman following up with
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative cahill if we make it for
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
the school year
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes juniors and seniors do get out
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
a little earlier than the rest of the
 
02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:39.589 align:start position:0%
a little earlier than the rest of the
segment

02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
segment
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
would they be held to
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
that school year even though they are
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
technically out of school i think we
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
would still look are they duly enrolled
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of if they've not graduated yet
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
or separated yet i don't know i i'll be
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
honest in saying i don't know how we've
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with that issue even currently in
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
terms of looking at that summer slide
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
type of scenario i don't i don't i don't
 
02:16:03.189 --> 02:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
know how we've dealt with that but i
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
think we're looking are they duly
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
enrolled duly enrolled in school and is
 
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
school in session in the particular
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
02:16:21.119 --> 02:16:22.229 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
the

02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
getting calls from parents at say like
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know my child is working until 11 pm
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
is as legal as this allowed
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
is there ever any follow-up to those
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
discussions uh where the parent says
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
something like
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't want my child to lose their
 
02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
um i don't want my child to lose their
job

02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh if they complain to the manager that
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're not getting their homework done
 
02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
or they're incapable of meeting other
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities because that's one of
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
the pressure points that i see on this
 
02:16:48.719 --> 02:16:50.150 align:start position:0%
the pressure points that i see on this
is

02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
students feeling like they don't want to
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
lose that job
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and don't want to like upset things at
 
02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:57.270 align:start position:0%
and don't want to like upset things at
home

02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
but also
 
02:17:00.309 --> 02:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
and as a consequence of that not telling
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
the employer i can't work until 10 pm at
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
night because i'm failing my classes
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the i think it's a great
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
question because it's actually a large
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
part of the dialogue in those contexts
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
is because you'd say you think you'd say
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
to the parent well don't let them work
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
but the parents will often say to us
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
well if i
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
tell my kid they
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
can't do it they'll just replace them
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
with someone who can do it so it's kind
 
02:17:23.679 --> 02:17:24.309 align:start position:0%
with someone who can do it so it's kind
of

02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's the concern so you're spot on
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
that that is the issue is that parents
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
are seeing it as if uh they set the the
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
barrier their kid might lose their job
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
or uh those hour you know so that is the
 
02:17:35.519 --> 02:17:39.110 align:start position:0%
or uh those hour you know so that is the
concern

02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
in thank you um and in an instance where
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
maybe you have a more
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
maybe you have a parent who says well my
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
child can handle that you know it they
 
02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
can toughen up or they can figure out
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
how to do their homework maybe they can
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
do it in study hall that's one that i
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
have personal experience with
 
02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.709 align:start position:0%
have personal experience with
um

02:17:58.709 --> 02:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
is that then putting that 16 year old in
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
the position of having to go to the
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
employer where there's that power
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
imbalance and say
 
02:18:10.309 --> 02:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
i need to be let out earlier than
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
at night which may make that student
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable or pressure them to not in
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
fact ask the employer that
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%

if someone gets out of hand that's what
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%

02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the 22 years that we've been
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
operating in the state we we must have
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
employed tens of thousands of young kids
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we send out into the world with
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
these life skills
 
02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
these life skills
and

02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
from some of the things that i've heard
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
today absolutely uh you know
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
we we don't require we're not we're not
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
pressuring these kids to work
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
into the night or longer hours we are
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make it available to them if
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
they so choose
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
to make that decision
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
with their educators with their teachers
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
their principals their families we're
 
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
trying to let the choice be theirs but
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
the way that the law cert the currently
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
is written
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
very confusing very limiting
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
and i'll give an example and because
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
i've heard you know extracurricular
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
activities and and you know what do
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
those hours mean you know we had a young
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
gentleman um
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
didn't want me to use his name here
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
today but he was in a band a a real
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
instrumental band he was a guitar player
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
he was a great student
 
02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:57.030 align:start position:0%
he was a great student
but

02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
pulled good grades was 16 years old had
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
his parents permission but he he wanted
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
he wanted to work because he had to put
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
himself through school he he was going
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
to be the one responsible to earn his
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
way through college he had his own car
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
payment he had his own gas to put in and
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
he certainly made a little bit of money
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
playing with this ban but not a lot
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and he
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
he with the with the law currently
 
02:22:23.439 --> 02:22:24.550 align:start position:0%
he with the with the law currently
written

02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
i couldn't give him the hours without
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
going into violation i couldn't let him
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
work the hours that he wanted to work
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
without going into violation
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
and he ended up just getting another job
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
so in the instance where we're concerned
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
about me
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
leveraging or or or threatening someone
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
to lose their job because they can't
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
fulfill it's the absolute opposite
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to answer any questions
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
that i can about my business and how
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
this law affects what i do
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
um but it's i think it's real important
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
that you guys that everyone here
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
understands that for aroma joes at least
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is um a a real opportunity to
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
continue doing what we're doing for
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
these for these kids and in since that
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
um night work sliding scale very very
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
confusing and honestly it it's not worth
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
trying to track
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that that is
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
with the way that it's that the way it's
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you members of addition followed
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
by sullivan
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
what

02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
what would be the drop-off in picked up
 
02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:42.550 align:start position:0%
what would be the drop-off in picked up
skills

02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
skills
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
that one of your student employees could
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
pick up
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
in 24 hours a week versus 35 hours a
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
week is there a measurable difference
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
there yep um thank you for your question
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
no there no there's not a measurable
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
difference but i can give you an example
 
02:23:58.479 --> 02:23:59.510 align:start position:0%
difference but i can give you an example
of

02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
300 employees that i currently have
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
control over in the state that's only 13
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
of those 34 stores are mine so there's
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to be a over a thousand
 
02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:14.389 align:start position:0%
going to be a over a thousand
instances

02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
instances
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
where i can't quantify that for you but
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
i can tell you the 300 employees that i
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
have the average 16 or 17 year old hours
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
worked for me
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
is 16 hours a week i'm not going to get
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere near
 
02:24:33.030 --> 02:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
the 35 hour cap
 
02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
the 35 hour cap
but

02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some instances
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
like the band member that i just gave
 
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
you where he
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
went and worked somewhere else kept his
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
kept a job
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
he left me completely then he just chose
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
to work two part-time jobs somewhere
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
else and i'm saying well he wanted to
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
stay with us i wanted to employ him but
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
i couldn't so he just chose to left and
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
then worked two part-time jobs somewhere
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
else follow up follow up thank you um to
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
paraphrase an earlier conversation uh
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
during a different hearing
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there are
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
employers in the state of new hampshire
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
who are not as
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
considerate as far as staying away from
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
the cap and making sure that their
 
02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:17.830 align:start position:0%
the cap and making sure that their
employees

02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't feel that kind of pressure that a
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
place like aroma joes would be
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure i believe that that's possible um i
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't know of any um nor would i want to
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
take a stab at a guess at any but
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
certainly i believe that's possible i
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
believe that that's probably more
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
possible with companies that have
 
02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:37.670 align:start position:0%
possible with companies that have
a

02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
eight hour shifts we we don't do that
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
specific to the labor pool that we have
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we're lucky i get a whole flood of
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
new people every year but the back end
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
of that the unlucky part of that is they
 
02:25:50.319 --> 02:25:51.429 align:start position:0%
of that the unlucky part of that is they
leave

02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
leave
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
a year and a half two and a half years
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
after they start so
 
02:25:57.270 --> 02:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
for me
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have specific
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
information that i can answer that says
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
yeah those people do it but we don't i
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't know that but i for but for us our
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
longest shifts are four hours
 
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why i don't approach
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
that 35 hour cap i support the 35-hour
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
cap because there are instances where
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
that would have helped me retain an
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
individual that wanted to stay working
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
for me but i couldn't without going into
 
02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:29.270 align:start position:0%
for me but i couldn't without going into
violation

02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
violation
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the band member um and the
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
fact that you would have been in
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
violation if you had
 
02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:43.910 align:start position:0%
violation if you had
um

02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
done what he
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
he wanted to do
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
could you specifically exactly what the
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
violation would have been and what
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what he wanted you to do yep he
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
sure so he was under 18 and he wanted to
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
work later at night we closed at 9 00
 
02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
work later at night we closed at 9 00
p.m

02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
p.m
 
02:27:01.830 --> 02:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i couldn't
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
employ him past 8 p.m
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
so and he wanted more than the allowable
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
hours during that sliding scale week so
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
if school was in session for
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
five days a week he was only allowed to
 
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.110 align:start position:0%
five days a week he was only allowed to
work

02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
those those hours into the night but i
 
02:27:20.070 --> 02:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want to deal with any of that
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
because of the confusion and because of
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
tracking this one individual would have
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
just taken more resources that it was
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
that it's worked than what it would have
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
been worth but i felt bad for
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
for him
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
because i didn't want to keep track of
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
of how difficult it would be currently
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
to keep track of
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
so what exactly would be the violation
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
that you would have uh he would have
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
gone go sorry yeah thank you for your
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
question he would have he would have
 
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
question he would have he would have
he

02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
would i would have wanted him to work
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
more than eight hours
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
following a night that he would have
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
and and all that work for one individual
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
i just don't have the resources for that
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
by sharing
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman i want
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that one and i i think i
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
understand the concern with the current
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
night work
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
but as a substitute
 
02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:17.590 align:start position:0%
but as a substitute
where

02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
there would be proposed a
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
a lim a hard limit on start time a hard
 
02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
limit on end time
 
02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:27.510 align:start position:0%
limit on end time
it

02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
would that be a viable solution to you
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
if those times did not match your
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
business hours either if they couldn't
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
start when your store opened or they
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't work past the time when your
 
02:28:41.270 --> 02:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
store closed sure thank you for your
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
question right now the way that the re
 
02:28:47.590 --> 02:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
the bill has been introduced it does fit
 
02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
with with what i
 
02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:50.389 align:start position:0%
with with what i
w

02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
w
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
with what works for me so i guess i
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
would need a scenario to answer
 
02:28:54.479 --> 02:28:55.910 align:start position:0%
would need a scenario to answer
specifically

02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
and if i may follow up i'm
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
i apologize i'm kind of asking you to
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
project to employers who aren't here for
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
example a farmer who might employ
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
someone pretty early in the morning
 
02:29:08.479 --> 02:29:11.030 align:start position:0%
someone pretty early in the morning
or

02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know what time mcdonald's closes
 
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
i haven't been to one in a while or some
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
places sure a place that's open till 11
 
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
or open until midnight where it would
 
02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:20.309 align:start position:0%
or open until midnight where it would
clearly

02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
fall outside of this um
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
it all
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:28.550 align:start position:0%
my question is
unless

02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
unless
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
your business happens to fit the model
 
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the bill isn't the cure worse than
 
02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
and the bill isn't the cure worse than
the

02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
than the problem
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you find yourselves
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
find yourself in a situation where
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're unable to employ people in your
 
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
business hours because of the change in
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
law sure so thank you for the follow-up
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll try the best i can to answer
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
that the way that i understand that
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
you've asked it
 
02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:53.429 align:start position:0%
you've asked it
so

02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
for me in my experience with just what i
 
02:29:57.910 --> 02:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
do i would say that this wouldn't a
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
farmer would love this
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
an individual that happens to not have
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
to go to school because we all
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand school is much different than
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
when we were all there you had to be
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
there at 7 30 you left at 2 30. done
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
that was that was easy for them that is
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
not the way it is now right so for me if
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
a farmer could have an individual that
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be in school for any for
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
that one particular day let's just say
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
that this individual student has enough
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
credits or they have a work release day
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
that day i would think that the farmer
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
would love it that that person could
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
show up at three a.m
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
and work an eight-hour shift or a
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
10-hour shift and not be restricted now
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
that may not work for a restaurant that
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
is open to 11 p.m
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
hey honestly i don't like the 10 p.m cut
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
off date i i think it should be later
 
02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:47.429 align:start position:0%
off date i i think it should be later
but

02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
but in the spirit of what the the other
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
um committee members said i do believe
 
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
that kids should get rest and should be
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
prepared for the next day
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
the issue that i have currently is
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
they have to they're leaving at 8 00 p.m
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
but they're not going home
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
to to study and do homework they're
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
driving to their friend's house and
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
playing video games or that like and i'm
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
not trying to i'm not trying to fix the
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
the state of our youth i'm trying to
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
employ the ones that want more hours and
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
that want to do this job and i truly
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
believe that companies like mine are
 
02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:26.150 align:start position:0%
believe that companies like mine are
doing

02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
right by the state
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
all right representative

any uh any additional questions
representing

02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
representing
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today and taking our questions
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
um it's been said that
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
parents have complained to dol that
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
their child's working longer than they
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
should be um have you read interactions
 
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
with parents where they come in to you
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
and say hey you know can you give them
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
less hours or if this job is interfering
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
can you adjust their hours or anything
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
like that if you had that type of
 
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
interaction when there's been a problem
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
because they're working
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
not too many hours but because they're
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
working an extra job outside of their
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
regular curriculum
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure yep yeah thank you for your
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
question yeah we have and and um and we
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
deal with that um like we deal with any
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
situation with any interaction with a
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
parent customer vendor or an employee
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
that absolutely we ask what's the
 
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
problem what what's going on their their
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
grades are slipping absolutely no
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
problem we are a completely open and um
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
very transparent company with our
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
employees we tend to not try to deal
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
with the parents too much because we
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't employ the parents but if there's
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
a real issue
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
i would hope that they would feel
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable reaching out to me before
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
calling the new new hampshire department
 
02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
of labor but if they if if they did and
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
it became an issue absolutely it's not
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
more important to me that i have a 16
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
year old kid working
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
from seven to nine
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's more important that that kid's got
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
a good home life and he's got in and
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
they've got good grades and they're
 
02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
they've got good grades and they're
generally

02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
happy in their life this isn't about me
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
just covering a two-hour shift it's i
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
truly believe
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
if more people did what we did and cared
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
for these kids
 
02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is ultimately what's better for me
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
as a business if i have happy productive
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
employees then i'm going to have a very
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
successful business so i'm not trying to
 
02:33:45.990 --> 02:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
create an environment where i'm
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
forcing kids to work i i just want to
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
create an environment where if they want
 
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
to and in some cases they need their
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
parents permission
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
then absolutely i would like them to
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
work for me because i think we're doing
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
great things for them and i'm and i'm
 
02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:01.110 align:start position:0%
great things for them and i'm and i'm
speaking

02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
for my employees they want more hours
 
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
susie

02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
susie
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this is going
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
to be would you believe
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
because i agree with everything you say
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
because i personally have a daughter
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
that actually works for your company
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
here in concord
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
and they've been very supportive
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
academically she's fantastic sports-wise
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
she's a great athlete um but when she
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
asks for time off or when she asks for
 
02:34:34.389 --> 02:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
time to work
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
that company that you own has been very
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
supportive and we appreciate that so
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
so i actu i actually do believe that and
 
02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i would hope we were doing
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
something right all this all this time
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
so see no other questions thank you very
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony appreciate that
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%

02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
mike summers i'm the president ceo of
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lodging and restaurant
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
association we're here in support of sb
 
02:35:09.439 --> 02:35:11.110 align:start position:0%
association we're here in support of sb
345.

02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
345.
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
i think you've kind of hashed this to
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
death i don't know that i have much to
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
add to that so
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
um a couple things uh i will add is you
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
know there was some discussion in the
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
senate hearing around night work and
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
obviously night work has been
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
hugely problematic for our industry uh
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's confusing many people were in
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
violation of it um simply because you
 
02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:30.070 align:start position:0%
violation of it um simply because you
know

02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
if a
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
student worked uh to 8 30 on tuesday and
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
wednesday and then tried to put in a
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
nine or a ten hour shift on saturday or
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
sunday or you know friday night they
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
were automatically in violation it was
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
extremely confusing and as the previous
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
speaker said most businesses just stayed
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
away from it because they didn't
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
understand it didn't know how to manage
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
it and frankly it wasn't worth the time
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
and effort so um you know i think
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
originally when senator hennessey filed
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill she actually just struck the
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
whole night work section which was what
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
we had testified in support of and
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
preferred um but i think that there was
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
also some uh discussion in that
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee hearing much like you're
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
having here about you know what should
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes be and i will concur with uh
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
the statement made earlier that you know
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
10 p.m uh outside of this the school
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
year for um you know
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
middle of the summer for student on a
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
saturday night is problematic for our
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
industry i'll be perfectly honest with
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
you so um
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know ultimately we'd love
 
02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
to see it struck
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
but if that can't be the case and
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
obviously we'd like the bright line to
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
be as late as it can be because again
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
our industry flexibility is going to be
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i need to really speak
 
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
to lounge um but
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll end with that the one thing
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
i will say is i guess the
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
existing lines 12 through 17
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
again change made in 2018
 
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
hugely confusing for businesses no
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
businesses took advantage of this to my
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge and frankly it ended up being
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
more of a headache than anything else so
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
we're actually happy to see that go away
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
um and try to come to some other kind of
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
an arrangement so
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
with that i will end and i'm happy to
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to answer any questions mr
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
summers um i believe
 
02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:10.309 align:start position:0%
summers um i believe
if

02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the senate unless i'm
 
02:37:14.550 --> 02:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
totally missed something here um senator
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
soucy wanted the ten o'clock um
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh again and that was a compromise that
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
was made is that i believe that is the
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
case yes but i also don't want to speak
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
for senator susie but i believe that was
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
the case okay
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions mr summers it was
 
02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:27.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions mr summers it was
amendable

02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
amendable
 
02:37:30.070 --> 02:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jim um
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
no more i i'm asking you to speak for
 
02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:34.070 align:start position:0%
no more i i'm asking you to speak for
your

02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
um your organization if you feel
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing that uh if
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:37:43.349 --> 02:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
night work section instead of what it
 
02:37:43.359 --> 02:37:44.469 align:start position:0%
night work section instead of what it
said

02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
um provided that uh no person of
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
the age uh governed
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
could work past
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
say either eight or nine o'clock p.m on
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
a night before school was in session and
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
said nothing else would your
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
organization be able to support that
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
as with all legislative language i'd
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
love to see that in writing first um but
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think that again i think that
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
with the language you see there on lines
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
2021 i think that was just an
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation to try to get to some
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a compromise i guess um i don't
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
know that i could say definitively that
 
02:38:23.830 --> 02:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
we would support that i would want to
 
02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
see the see it in writing but ultimately
 
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think that there is some recognition
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
from industry and from business owners
 
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
that yes we don't necessarily want our
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
kids work until one in the morning every
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
school night either so um
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
one thing i will add is
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you're aware but there's
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
a workforce shortage right now and
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much uh our workers are setting
 
02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
the standards so when somebody asks us
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
for time off or they can't work past an
 
02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
hour uh businesses are accommodating it
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
they're falling all over themselves to
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
accommodate it because if we don't there
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
are four other businesses within the
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
same city block that will be happy to
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
accommodate that so it is a very much a
 
02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
workers environment right now and we
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
02:39:07.990 --> 02:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
summers um the 12 o'clock on friday and
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
saturday night um
 
02:39:10.399 --> 02:39:12.790 align:start position:0%
saturday night um
given

02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
pouring establishments should typically
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
stay open later than that would
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to see that struck and to
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville's was
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
and just have a to 8 p.m on as long as
 
02:39:27.270 --> 02:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
there was a previous next day of school
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate the holiday issues
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we spoke about earlier and vacation
 
02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
that we spoke about earlier and vacation
weeks

02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
well and i think
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
part of the well
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
part of the clunky part of night work
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
was this whole um days when school is in
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
session is the way it's currently
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
drafted and the real issue with that is
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
sunday was not considered considered a
 
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
school day even though they had school
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know first thing monday morning
 
02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
but they couldn't work later on fridays
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
because it was a school day so the
 
02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
existing structure didn't really work
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
either so so
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
but to your question um
 
02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i i frankly we would love to see
 
02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
night work just go away it has been
 
02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
nothing but a headache for for industry
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
um but if we were to do something
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
um again i think we should focus it
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
around when school is in session uh
 
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
because i think there's a there's a
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
recognition there um i don't know about
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
eight or nine o'clock and again i will
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
go back to my early statement i want to
 
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
see it in writing before i make any
 
02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:24.870 align:start position:0%
see it in writing before i make any
commitments

02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
so you know other hands thank you very
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
much thank you mr summers i don't have
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
any other pink cards or anyone else like
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah i'm closing the hearing on uh
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.399 --> 02:40:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
is this a natural reaction i turn to the
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
right i guess i i have a question of the
 
02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
right i guess i i have a question of the
committee

02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
um we have a situation with house senate
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill 276 that we heard first thing this
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
morning we have a bill in front of us
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's relatively simple and we have an
 
02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:53.830 align:start position:0%
that's relatively simple and we have an
amendment

02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:55.269 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
this was thrown at me this week just
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
like you know you guys when i sent it to
 
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
you last night that was the first i had
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
received the the official amendment that
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
i sent it on
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
we have two situations here we can wait
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
till next wednesday if we want to exact
 
02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:10.070 align:start position:0%
till next wednesday if we want to exact
this

02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
if we execute um today
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
and pass it on to finance
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
we are technically within it has to be
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
out of committee today
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
if not i don't know what the speaker's
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to do about suspending rules
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
because it's not
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
because it
 
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
bills have to go to second committee
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
have to be done today
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm in a between a rock and a hard
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
place here because i have a lot of
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
members not here and i don't know how
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
people are going to vote
 
02:41:38.479 --> 02:41:39.190 align:start position:0%
people are going to vote
i

02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
our lane has to do with the original
 
02:41:45.359 --> 02:41:47.030 align:start position:0%
our lane has to do with the original
bill

02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
um the finance part isn't in our lane
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i'd rather chuck it over to the
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
people that do
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
but because i don't know i haven't had a
 
02:41:55.349 --> 02:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
caucus i don't know who's going to do
 
02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
anything i don't want to
 
02:41:58.230 --> 02:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
cut my nose off to spite my face here
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
so um is there a
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
big group of people that wants this
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
thing to die could let me know now so i
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
wait until next wednesday to exact this
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman talk about the amendment or
 
02:42:15.269 --> 02:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill uh the amendment
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
if the underlying bill i don't think
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
so it's underlying bills yeah there's
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
personally i'm not going to support the
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.359 --> 02:42:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone could
 
02:42:54.389 --> 02:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
adopt that amendment
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative proud uh just question of
 
02:42:57.279 --> 02:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
representative proud uh just question of
the

02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:59.830 --> 02:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
the chairman um
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the deadline tomorrow at noon for two
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee bills
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
or to today for two community
 
02:43:07.279 --> 02:43:07.830 align:start position:0%
or to today for two community
then bills

02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
then bills
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative um part of the calendar
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
today is the last date to report out
 
02:43:14.309 --> 02:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
bills that would go to a second
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee and that's usually at noon
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
so i think we've already i don't know
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
what reporting out means well i
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that means we've
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
already missed the deadline and the
 
02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
house clerk has directed to put it on
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar as no recommendation am i
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
wrong on that
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
no that
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer if i may yes and
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going by the testimony of which
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
might have been before you came in the
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
testimony of some of the presenters on
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the statement was made that the
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
speaker has been made aware that the
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
chair of finance has been made aware of
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
what we're doing so they are ready
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
if if we should get the even though
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
we've we've missed the deadline and i
 
02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
actually talked to heather too about
 
02:43:58.240 --> 02:43:59.110 align:start position:0%
actually talked to heather too about
this

02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that everyone knows what we're
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
thinking of doing
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
even though we've missed noon already um
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
they should be ready for our action
 
02:44:12.469 --> 02:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
should we decide to take it
 
02:44:12.479 --> 02:44:14.710 align:start position:0%
should we decide to take it
fine

02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open an executive
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
is there a motion on the floor on the
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
amendment on the house bill 276
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion that
 
02:44:40.469 --> 02:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
i'll move the amendment
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to move amendment 2022-1489
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
s could you repeat that yes
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
2 2 0 2 2
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
1 4 8 9 s
 
02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:00.950 align:start position:0%
1 4 8 9 s
okay

02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's been moved by brian uh seaworth
 
02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative sullivan
 
02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
you're uh recognized to speak to motion
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much mr chairman and
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'll echo what uh both
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
you have said mr chairman and what my
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
namesake across the aisle has said
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is something that
 
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
really needs to go to finance and
 
02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know i like some of my colleagues i
 
02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
i have my own opinion on this
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
but i think we'd be doing a disservice
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
try to handle a finance issue here in
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
labor committee
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
and so prevent this bill from moving
 
02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:42.710 align:start position:0%
and so prevent this bill from moving
forward

02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:43.590 align:start position:0%
forward
so

02:45:43.590 --> 02:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.510 align:start position:0%
in that
vein

02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
vein
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
i've made the motion to pass the
 
02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:51.110 align:start position:0%
i've made the motion to pass the
amendment

02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
whatever i feel about it
 
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
as a means to get this to the correct
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee within the deadline
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
also comment it it may be a little off
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment likewise i think the
 
02:46:04.389 --> 02:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
underlying bill probably should have
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
gone to ways and means because that's
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
who's impacted by the change
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
not it's not a labor issue in terms of
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
the changes made but
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
that's neither here nor there
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:46:21.279 --> 02:46:22.309 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
i agree with everything that brian said
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
um i also uh recall what uh
 
02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative almi indicated that um
 
02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:30.309 align:start position:0%
representative almi indicated that um
uh

02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:31.750 --> 02:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
the money is
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
in existence now it might not be later
 
02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:34.870 align:start position:0%
in existence now it might not be later
um

02:46:34.870 --> 02:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
and um and i know also know that finance
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
is loath to um
 
02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:41.750 align:start position:0%
is loath to um
pass

02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
in an off-budget year so um
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
it'll be up to them to decide if they
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
want to break with that
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
that habit
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
um but again i think it's a finance
 
02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
again as i said before it's bizarre that
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
we got either the bill or the amendment
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
um just doesn't fit but we i think we
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
need to move it along so that it can be
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
addressed where it needs to be addressed
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want anyone messing with a
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
labor bill in commerce or in municipal
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
government so i think we are obligated
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
will deal with it and then if you don't
 
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
like it you can vote against on the
 
02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
like it you can vote against on the
floor

02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
floor
 
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
um any other additional comments
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none mr clerk the emotion on the
 
02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:32.830 align:start position:0%
seeing none mr clerk the emotion on the
floor

uh to see if they have any concerns
 
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
um provided it gets to a committee of
 
02:52:22.230 --> 02:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
conference and passes on the floor
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%

that bill so
 
02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:42.880 align:start position:0%

02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%

02:52:45.840 --> 02:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
