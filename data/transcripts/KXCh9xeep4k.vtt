enough board members to put together a
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
quorum to
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
review cases as necessary and to make
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%

essentially negative
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
in response to most of those i'll circle
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
a very high level
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh essentially we did work with the
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
beginning in the summer
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
obviously it was a very challenging time
 
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.270 align:start position:0%
obviously it was a very challenging time
and

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
i would say the governor's budget
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
director was focused more on
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
some of the larger departments obviously
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
our percentage of the
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
overall general fund state budget is
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
relatively minor but
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
we did have back and forth with the
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director at the time
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
and i shared a lot of detail
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
about our operations and what we do and
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
it was my formal position that
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
operate as a functional board if there
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
were any
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
any significant reductions to our
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
general fund budget
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
any changes to our position
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
funding and ultimately the governor's
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
budget director
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
agreed with that and essentially adopted
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
the budget that we had submitted as part
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
department budget phase
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
and the budget that that has actually
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
been submitted by the governor
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
closely tracks what we originally worked
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
on over the summer
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of comparison to prior years um
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
i think overall for the biennium
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
that there is an increase to general
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
funds of
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
approximately thirty five thousand
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
dollars um
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's attributable to an 11 000
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase scheduled in fiscal year 23 for
 
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
increase scheduled in fiscal year 23 for
class

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
10 personal services
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
and class 60 benefits 10 000
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
increase in fiscal year 22
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
compared to authorized fiscal year 21
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 23 17 286 increase and
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
class 60 benefits compared to fiscal
 
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
class 60 benefits compared to fiscal
year

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
21. it's been my experience that our
 
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.069 align:start position:0%
21. it's been my experience that our
class

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
60 benefits budget tends to be a little
 
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
60 benefits budget tends to be a little
high

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
and i know it's a little bit of a moving
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
target but
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's likely that the actual
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures in that class will be lower
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
and so our overall increase for the
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
biennium will probably be
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
less than the 35 thousand dollars i
 
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.509 align:start position:0%
less than the 35 thousand dollars i
mentioned

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
there are some other minor increases
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
so for example we are coming up to the
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
final year of a five-year lease
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
so starting this fall i will go through
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
the rfp process
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
and we have a little extra money in our
 
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.190 align:start position:0%
and we have a little extra money in our
rents

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
rents
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh class line to
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
address that anticipated rent increase
 
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
if it materializes and i think that's
 
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.310 align:start position:0%
if it materializes and i think that's
1861

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
1861
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
per fiscal year um
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
what else fiscal year 27 oit
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
um after class 27 fiscal year 22
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
we uh scheduled to
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
replace a switch that we uh we have in
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
our i.t closet currently we're using a
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
loaner provided by oit
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the cost for the
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
switch is 3500
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
so for that reason our class 27 budget
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
is higher uh compared to
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 but fiscal year
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
23 once that expense has been met that
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
number actually will be lower compared
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much that's pretty much
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
the high level
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
of view of the budget i'm happy to
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
answer any particular questions you may
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
have online items
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
um yes man i'm sure i'm just trying to
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
find out if the paperwork that our
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
witness is test
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
or referencing if that was sent out
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
electronically because
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
i i think that lba is posting as we go
 
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.910 align:start position:0%
i i think that lba is posting as we go
along

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
mrs levines has been without electricity
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
much of the night and in the morning
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
although i see her
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
that she has managed to get here so mr
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
hoffman was
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
working by himself for a while due to
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
electrical problems
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
it looks like nancy is back so you'll be
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
able to see that on the lba website as
 
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.710 align:start position:0%
able to see that on the lba website as
before

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you it's going to say our power
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
went on at 10 30 and came back at 6am so
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
i can relate
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
oh boy well we have a generator so i
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't complain but i did notice that
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
we were almost the only ones that had
 
00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
we were almost the only ones that had
power

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a generator as well okay
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair i know representative
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
leishman was planning on being there in
 
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.590 align:start position:0%
leishman was planning on being there in
person

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
i expect he'll be there soon yeah i
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
imagine he is
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
he may have been without electricity as
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
well yeah i saw on the news peterborough
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
was hit
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
so yeah you have to live for it's rough
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have power
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
well i have a generator too but we had
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
we it's my understanding that hb2 was
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
released to the governor
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
by ols yesterday for a last
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
look at the bill just as any of us when
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
we file a bill
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
gets the bill before it's released to
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
the public i am expecting
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
that it will be released to us today
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
if so tomorrow morning at nine o'clock
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
we will be reviewing our sections of hb2
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
kind of in generality to give us a good
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
overview this is 167 pages
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
and some of the things that if you've
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
read hb2 already because we have had the
 
00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:21.990 align:start position:0%
read hb2 already because we have had the
draft

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
we are the last i think the department
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
of energy starts something like
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
section 84 85 and runs through section
 
00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:33.910 align:start position:0%
section 84 85 and runs through section
155

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
155
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
it's many pages oplc
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
who will be here on thursday is much the
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
same we've asked them to come prepared
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
to talk to it
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
but i thought if we had any questions it
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
would be good to ask lba
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
our questions and give them a little
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
chance before some of our agencies get
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
here with the bigger ones
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
we will have at 9 30 the department of
 
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.790 align:start position:0%
we will have at 9 30 the department of

labor
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to ask tracy to
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
mute us and ask all of you to mute
 
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.230 align:start position:0%
mute us and ask all of you to mute
yourselves

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%

of each year after our non-worker comp

uh operating car costs are paid
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
so we are a general fund contributor
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
two years ago the labor department

documented

documented
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and wrote a new cost allocation plan
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
so that the burden on either of those
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
funding sources the administration fund
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
or the restricted fund
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
can actually be traced to measurable
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
statistics from our operation
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
we believe that we've continued to
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
improve on that model
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
in this new budget request a number of
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
expenses that were
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
budgeted in each division have been

allocation method
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
we believe that this approach will will
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
do several things
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate business office functions
 
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.590 align:start position:0%

additional dollars for our general fund

governor's office provided us an overall

expense target
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
of 9.5 million dollars in year one
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
that represented a 10 percent decrease
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
from our
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
2021 adjusted authorized the
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
adjusted year 2 target was also about
 
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.549 align:start position:0%
adjusted year 2 target was also about

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
doit staffing has also been reduced from
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
five full-time direct staff to two
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
full-time direct staff one position uh
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
has been restored in the governor's
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
as we're one full-time and one part-time
 
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.830 align:start position:0%
as we're one full-time and one part-time
doit

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
doit
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
staff we are in the process of launching
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
our new on-base
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
document management system this spring
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and expect to realize some operational
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
improvements as a result
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
what we need really in the new biennium
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
rather than deeper staffing
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
is operational flexibility and have
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
attempted to provide for this through
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
better funding of some of the
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
operational class lines
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
the governor has also included a
 
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.789 align:start position:0%
the governor has also included a
significant

00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for technology funding
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
and this is to allow us to migrate off
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
of what i'm i'm told is the state's
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
last remaining as400 ibm mainframe
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
and before i conclude one other note
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to make
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
because we we have a correction that we
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
would like to ask for
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
the funding mix the revenue mix
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
in accounting unit 6000
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
went astray somehow in the governor's
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
if we could reduce 6000
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
class 6 revenue by
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
thirty 48 dollars are you on ken uh
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
335 yep okay
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
so if you see the the agency income
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
classes at the bottom
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
class six and class nine yep those are
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
those are what i'm referring to so let's
 
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.590 align:start position:0%
those are what i'm referring to so let's
see

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
class six in year one
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
we'd like to reduce that by forty eight
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
thousand five thirty seven
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then reduce the same class by forty
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
five thousand
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
eight seventeen in year two
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
and then increase accounting unit 6000
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
class 9 by the same figures in each year
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
we we believe that the state
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
would benefit by roughly a hundred
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars over the biennium by
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
having the correct fund mix in that
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
accounting unit have you submitted that
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
to us in paper
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
we we have not will you please
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
sure thank you absolutely
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
and um that concludes my remarks
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative over so i'm happy to take
 
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
representative over so i'm happy to take
questions

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
we have a draft copy of hb2 and you have
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
quite a large
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
section in there um are you prepared to
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
talk about that today or do you want to
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
come back
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
no uh we can talk about that we know
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
what we submitted to the governor's
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
office we haven't seen what was
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen it all right um then i
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
guess we'll have to have you come back
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 is my understanding was sent back to
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
the governor's office sometime yesterday
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
which is um normal
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
procedure with all laws the person who
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
puts it in
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
gets a chance to review it and
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
before it becomes public we are
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
expecting it to become public
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
and although we have draft copies since
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen it
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
in fairness to you we'll ask you to come
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
back i'll just schedule some time
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
i don't think it'll take a long time to
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
go over it but it did seem to be
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
rather lengthy so we would like your
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
input on that
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
sure happy to do it tell me about the
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
reduction in class 27
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
how did that get reduced yeah
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
um significant staffing reductions
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
i i might have mentioned uh that there
 
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.430 align:start position:0%
i i might have mentioned uh that there
were

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
five full-time positions budgeted
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the doit budget and we currently
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
have two uh staff members
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
so those other three positions were
 
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.830 align:start position:0%
so those other three positions were
reduced

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
but we did get one back in the
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended as a
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
so you believe in that area you came out
 
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.710 align:start position:0%
so you believe in that area you came out
okay

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
because i saw that you said all your
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs were
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
funded yes okay yes i did not
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just to add to that um we
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
had already determined
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
that uh we were going to reduce the
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
number of positions
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh in doit that were that were embedded
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
here as direct
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
positions okay questions from
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
yes uh commissioner maryfield if you
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
were to be
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
level funded with the prior biennium how
 
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.909 align:start position:0%
level funded with the prior biennium how
much

00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
more money would need to go to labor to
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
be level funded
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
level funding in the efficiency budget
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
in the overall and the entire budget if
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
department of labor were to receive the
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
same amount of money it received in the
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
prior budget
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
what's the difference how much more
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
would it be for it to be level funding
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
between the two budgets
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
i think my immediate guess is it's about
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
a half a million dollars
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh let me see if i can
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
so total governor budget 10.1 yeah
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's just about a half a million dollars
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not talking from the governor's
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
budget i'm talking from the budget past
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
right okay just make now it's clear
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay and are you referring to efficiency
 
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.750 align:start position:0%
okay and are you referring to efficiency
budget

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
then i'm referring to the budget that
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
we're being asked to approve today
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
in comparison with the budget we
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
approved two years ago absolutely so
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
that is the governor's recommended
 
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
that is the governor's recommended
budget

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay so uh roughly
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
forgive me half a million dollars thank
 
00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
forgive me half a million dollars thank
you

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for mr
 
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.630 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for mr
marinfield

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%

00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
minutes so we are all going to mute
 
00:28:59.039 --> 00:28:59.990 align:start position:0%
minutes so we are all going to mute
ourselves

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
and we'll be back at 10 o'clock
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully there are no more electrical
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
gremlins that show up
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
we have with us the agricultural
 
00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:17.350 align:start position:0%
we have with us the agricultural
commissioner

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
mr jasper do you have some handouts for
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
us someplace
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh i was not asked to
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
provide anything yeah you got a letter
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
from me
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
that said please provide handouts in
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
hard copy and bring them with you and
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
also digitally so that the people at
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
home can
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
see it because lba is putting that up on
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
the screen
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm afraid we didn't see that as a
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
matter of fact
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
i only learned that we were on
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
today when i was going through the
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
calendar uh last friday
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
so i think there's been some yeah janet
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
confirmed this with your office i don't
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
know who's doing that for you
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
last week before it came up in the
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
calendar okay
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
so your budget is on page 231
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
we will start we will go through it line
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
by line and we will ask some questions
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
as we go along
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
so at the bottom of page 231 you start
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
with your
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
class 10 which is going down can you
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
explain that to us
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
what we have have done in order to meet
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh target is we have
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have two two funds
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
the primarily the scale
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
and product testing fund and
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
we have traditionally bought uh
 
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.230 align:start position:0%
we have traditionally bought uh
equipment

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
primarily cars out of that uh our
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
fleet's in
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
in good shape and so we have shifted in
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
that area
 
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
that area
um

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.090 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.750 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
more personnel into that account and not
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing um
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles we may have one or two in there
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
but we've reduced that
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
then the other fund that we have is so
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner if i could yes
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
four 4 dollars and that's because you
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
shifted a person out for part of a year
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry maybe um
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
michelle should be on and i don't know
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
if she can be
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
brought on she'll sure she can if she's
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
up here yeah
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
michelle thibodeaux yes
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
michelle did you hear the question about
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the class class
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
10 it's down just four thousand dollars
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
from that and i don't have that detail
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
well she's looking for that though that
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
primarily we have done
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of shifting around and we have
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
that one change that we're asking for
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
to rsa 4 30 50.
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
integrated pest management and this is
 
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
integrated pest management and this is
how

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
we are managing our budget without doing
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
any layoffs
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.509 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner maybe while she's looking
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
we can go to class 11.
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
um that went up and i assume that is
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
your salary went up from 109
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
474 to 114
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
391 and then it jumps again
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
in 2023 to 122 336.
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
can you talk about those increases um
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean that would be primarily my
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
my salary
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh because
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
obviously commissioners aren't on a
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
scale and that probably brings me
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
to the to the top of the scale in the
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
final the final
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
year current expenses went up i'm now
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
on class 20 while michelle works out
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
what how did what i mean that jumped
 
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.669 align:start position:0%
what how did what i mean that jumped
five-fold

00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
five-fold
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on there
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
um i'm afraid again
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
that level of detail is something
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
michelle has
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
um michelle do you know the answer to
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't catch that one class
 
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.550 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't catch that one class
20

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
increased from two thousand nine hundred
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
dollars to ten thousand three hundred
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
i am i'm s i have to apologize i am
 
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.149 align:start position:0%
i am i'm s i have to apologize i am
looking

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
at a different budget so i'm not on the
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
same pages
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
as you i apologize i'm trying to pull it
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
up through
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
the computer system and it's not
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
cooperating with me
 
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:56.550 align:start position:0%
cooperating with me
oh

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
my pages are marked differently from
 
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.150 align:start position:0%
my pages are marked differently from
yours

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
yours
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know we have the budget book so we
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
have you on page 231
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
most of our um class
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
20 expenditures though we are
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
trying to put more of it under
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
putting transfers from other agencies
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
our department
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
would have just one class trying to have
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
one class
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
20 fund under the commissioner and the
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
account to pay those expenses i do see
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
your au 2133 division weights and
 
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.190 align:start position:0%
your au 2133 division weights and
measures

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
dropped 7 900
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
so you think that was just a a square
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
transfer from
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
we can track that down with a crosswalk
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
we should be able to yes okay it looks
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
like i'm sorry sean no i
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
i apologize it's difficult um
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i had intended to
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
do uh in the last budget and that
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
did not happen when i became
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i started
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
looking around i found that we had
 
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.270 align:start position:0%
looking around i found that we had
supplies

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
supplies
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
all over this place and we had way too
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
many things of
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
some things and uh it was just i said
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
no we have to stop this we need to have
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
all of our supplies centralized we can't
 
00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:46.069 align:start position:0%
all of our supplies centralized we can't
have

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
everybody duplicating everything because
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
in some areas
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think that makes sense we just ask you
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
because sometimes we don't see the
 
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.510 align:start position:0%
because sometimes we don't see the
correlation

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to cut anything where
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
you've had a
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
an actual strategy for bettering the
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
running of your agency
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
what about class 27 we are not used to
 
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.069 align:start position:0%
what about class 27 we are not used to
seeing

00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
transfers to doit go down so
 
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.589 align:start position:0%
transfers to doit go down so
dramatically

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
in fact we're used to seeing them go up
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
and nobody knows why so
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
to see them go down is wonderful well
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
we we replaced an awful lot of um
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh equipment this last year and as part
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the budget strategy we looked at
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
what did we really need to to replace
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so we're taking in to some degree a
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
gamble that um
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
we don't need to be replacing all of
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
these computers that were being
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
recommended so
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
we worked with doit and really looked at
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
what what our actual needs were and so
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
this was really
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
just we're not replacing as much
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense to have new
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
computers and not have any people to
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
operate them so we opted to
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
take the gamble in that direction
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
people are chuckling here you can't hear
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
my computer is still not cooperating
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
with me i apologize
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
maybe that's one that we should have
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
replaced but
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
that may be the most important one after
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
all she's doing your
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
accounting all right i have switched
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
over to page 233 and i'm in
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
basically the division of weights and
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
measures because you see
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation those kinds of
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
things are workers comp are given
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
figures given to you you live with them
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
schedule them we see again class 10
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
going up almost um
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
not quite a hundred thousand but close
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
to it ninety thousand
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
did you move people into division of
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
weights and measures
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the way that had been set up and it
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sense to me
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
product testing um
 
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
product testing um
[Music]

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
fund a lot of weights and measures
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
people were funded through there but
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
they aren't the people who bring in the
 
00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:17.430 align:start position:0%
they aren't the people who bring in the
income

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i realigned that so that
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
we were funding positions in regulatory
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
services with that instead of weights
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
and measures
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
so weights and measures uh personnel
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
were then funded
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
and you already mentioned you'd move
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
some of your equipment
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
and this is class 30 and new equipment
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
around to a more appropriate place so we
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
in this weights and measures budget as
 
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.910 align:start position:0%
in this weights and measures budget as
well

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative leishman has a question
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
how are you sean well paul i'm well
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
represented how are you good thanks
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
so on page 234 i see a substantial
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
increase about 175
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
000. and it looks like you're adding
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
like two
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
new people to the weights and measures
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
group well
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
no that's that's the realignment
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually as i just said i really never
 
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.829 align:start position:0%
actually as i just said i really never
understood

00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
why we were funding weights and measures
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
positions from
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
the other uh from the scale and product
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
testing fund
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
so we're just it came out
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know that we're we're using in total
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think more money out of that fund
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
but that did increase weights and
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
measures it was just a realignment
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay there's no new positions uh in this
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
budget at all
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
have you seen what the governor put in
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 for you
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
hope hopefully the language for
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh the integrated pest management is in
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
there we did request that and you'd
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
agreed that
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
but beyond that i haven't seen anything
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay we do have a draft copy so we have
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
the status of as i went to the governor
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday for final review
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're hoping it gets released to the
 
00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:25.349 align:start position:0%
we're hoping it gets released to the
public

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
this afternoon because it is in march
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we are working on the budget so it's
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
kind of late
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
we will probably have to ask you to come
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
back for 10 or 15 minutes
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
to go over that you do have a new fund
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
and of course we see the language but we
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
never see the rationale behind it or the
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
need or the business need or the
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
strategy you've come up with
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
to use that fund
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
commissioner

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
i know we're all a weight commissioner i
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
can see eyes but i see no no questions
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
and i see heads going no representative
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
waltz do you have a question
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
i do uh i don't mean to
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
talk over you um i just have a question
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
if you were to be level funded from the
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
prior biennium
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
um how much more would you require to be
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
level funded from the prior biennium
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
when we're talking um general fund
 
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.470 align:start position:0%
when we're talking um general fund
dollars

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh which for us is you know we're about
 
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.829 align:start position:0%
uh which for us is you know we're about
50

00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
50. um our general fund dollars the
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 is 460 000
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh we would need additional funding in
 
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh we would need additional funding in
423

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
423
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
and non-general fund dollars um
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
well when we when we do when everything
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
comes out in the wash
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're about a hundred just about two
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
short uh in 22
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
but only 27 000 short and 23.
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner wayne michelson
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm trying to catch you okay
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
when michelle's computer
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
works will you just zip over to or have
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
her zip over to janet
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
and understanding what happened in class
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
110 i don't want to leave you
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
without enough money to pay for an
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
existing employee
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
and when you see just a four thousand
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
dollar difference
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
you start thinking do we get enough
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
money for the employee
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe you have somebody who's vacant
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you're going to hire after
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
the year starts i don't i don't know but
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
we'd like to
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
just double check that so that you are
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
not left
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit to it too as well um
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
currently i was
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
i was hired just this past
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
year and another employee was hired
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
so we were kind of at the low level of
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
the pay scales
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
so that's why it drops so the next pay
 
00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:28.950 align:start position:0%
so that's why it drops so the next pay
scale

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
scale
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
it'll go up a little bit each year
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and we also do have a vacant position
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
um that we hopefully will be filling
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
soon okay so michelle if i let me make
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
sure i understand this because again my
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
concern is making sure we have enough
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
money to pay existing staff
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
and adjusted authorized 2020 with
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
one we have a hundred thousand
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
few dollars and in recommended 2022
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
we have 96 000 and a couple of dollars
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
so you you
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
think it's because we've had two staff
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
change and the pay scale's a little
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
lower than the people in 21 so you have
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
i believe so yes um i will definitely
 
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:18.069 align:start position:0%
i believe so yes um i will definitely
verify

00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
verify
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
that and get back to with janet
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
please we want to be sure everybody gets
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
paid who's
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
in the budget representative patch you
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
have your hand up sir
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair just just when
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner comes back
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
you addressed one concern i have the
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
other one is is will he be bringing back
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
a summary of the questions you asked uh
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
on each budget
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
well he basically told us he's added no
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
new full-time staff
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
no part-time staff he has moved people
 
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.670 align:start position:0%
no part-time staff he has moved people
around

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
um how many positions were eliminated
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
sean i didn't hear you say you're
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
eliminated but you reorganized
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
no i had he had just barely gotten back
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
up to full staffing i think we still had
 
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
up to full staffing i think we still had
one

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
vacancy in pesticides it's a
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
federally funded position but for the
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
first time
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
in anybody's memory we were finally back
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
up to uh full staffing when this
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
hit so uh good okay thank you
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
one of the questions we ask is is your
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
agency adequately staffed to complete
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
all work assigned to your agency in
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
state law
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason we ask that is because if
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
you get a performance review
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
and we have failed to staff you
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately you should not get a ding
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
on your ability to perform because the
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
legislature was unable
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
to provide you what you need we
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
we are we are not able to do everything
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
tasked with doing uh probably the two
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
divisions that are
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
are best able to perform all their tasks
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
are probably pesticides which of course
 
00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.109 align:start position:0%
are probably pesticides which of course
is

00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
extremely important to make sure that we
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
are adequately adequately
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
regulating the use of pesticides in the
 
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
regulating the use of pesticides in the
state

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
and plant industry
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
is i think um able to keep up with the
 
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.190 align:start position:0%
is i think um able to keep up with the
work

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
that they have and regulate those things
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
of course you know a big problem in this
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
state is in these
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
invasive species of plants and
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
insects and certainly um
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
plants are getting out of control when
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
you look at the bittersweet and you look
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
at the multiflora rose and
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
the knotweed and many things like that
 
00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:33.829 align:start position:0%
the knotweed and many things like that
but

00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know we're not able to be as
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
aggressive there
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
where we're not doing as good a a job
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
weights and measures and we're well
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
we'll hopefully get back up to full
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
full staffing we need to do more
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
auditing in that area
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
um you know we're keeping up with the
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
licensure and working
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
hard there but do we get out there and
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
check the work that other people are
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
doing as
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh as much as we should know um
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory services
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh again we're keeping up with the
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
licensure and the registration of
 
00:48:05.119 --> 00:48:06.069 align:start position:0%
licensure and the registration of
products

00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
but we're supposed to be actually doing
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
an analysis of many of those products
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're not able to do that with the staff
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
and never have been we're much better
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
off than we were
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
animal industry is the area that we're
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the worst shape really and that has a
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
lot to do with pet vending
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
laws were changed i made it very clear
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
we would be in complete failure
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
in that area my staff is working
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
extremely hard to do the best they can
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
um but you know we said we
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
needed at least four people to do what
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
was being asked
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
we were given one that's why we're
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get the database
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
and within that request which is a
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
separate bill there is an i.t
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
person for that um
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
in my office particularly i mean there
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
there are really three and a half of us
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
um and there really should be a
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
a real deputy commissioner here we can't
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
move forward with a lot of the things
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we should be that was something
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
that i was hoping to to request this
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
year but obviously with the pandemic and
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
everything else i
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
i chose not to but so the corollary to
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
is if we cannot add the adequate
 
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.309 align:start position:0%
is if we cannot add the adequate
staffing

00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
should we consider suspending a law for
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
because you are not staffed to do it
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
but um because they're so correlated
 
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
but um because they're so correlated
we're

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
doing many other things there's not a
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
specific thing that i could say
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
take this away and it'll alleviate it
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're intertwined and where
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
there are just
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
parts of things that we're not able to
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
get done
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
in in some of those areas okay
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
so this was a question from vice
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
chairman emery
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
what things are you doing that are found
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
in state law
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
that could be eliminated and why if any
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the things we're charged
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
with doing i don't think there's
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
anything that we are doing that should
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
be eliminated
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh that has a budgetary impact i think
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're all important
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
things and i think we just need to
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
continue to work to see
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
how we can get to that level of
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
performance where we can do everything
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
has asked us to do but you know when i
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
took over
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
former commissioner merrill referred to
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
what we do as
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
um triage to
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
it to some degree some areas that's
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
still true i think we are
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
in less triage mode than we used to be
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
except for animal industry and
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
particularly with the
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
pet vending that's a very very difficult
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
situation and frankly we're dealing with
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
some very very
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
difficult people and
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
so that's going to continue to be a real
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
but um okay we have two more questions
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
one of them was
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
discuss any hb2 sections obviously we
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
already talked about we'll have you back
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
to look at that
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
fund you have in there that will be i
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
don't know five or ten minute discussion
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
we'll probably put together
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
a roundtable and have several
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
commissioners with short sections come
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
be able to answer questions for us and
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
then the other one was what priorities
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
did you have that were not funded
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
what's the cost the description the
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
impact of not funding i think you've
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
spoken already
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
to the assistant commissioner situation
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
what else did you have
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
well the governor did approve all of our
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs and we
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
we went with a very lean um
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
ask if you will and um
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
so um you know the governor did
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
did address all of those and i didn't
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
for some other things that i would have
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
liked to because i recognize
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that we're going to have
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
in this budget cycle
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the one big ask that i that
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
he did
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
agree to we had funded uh in the last
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
biennium 750
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
000 for uh ag land development
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
which can be matched by federal funds
 
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.950 align:start position:0%
which can be matched by federal funds
obviously

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to spend any of that
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
we've asked and
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
he has agreed for 250 000 in the second
 
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.390 align:start position:0%
he has agreed for 250 000 in the second
biennium

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
which will bring us 250 000 of federal
 
00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:39.910 align:start position:0%
which will bring us 250 000 of federal
funds

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
so that was our one big ask that is
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
there um the others are
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
relatively small like 4 000 a year
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
increases for ag in the classroom
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
and the ffa programs and
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
um some other minor
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
minor things but you know we didn't ask
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
for a lot
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the governor thankfully did
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
did that did give us what we asked for
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
in our prioritized needs
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
okay so that runs through representative
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
hatcher's question representative
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
leishman you have a question
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh thanks man of chair is your
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
microphone on yes it is
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
um so on page 271 or
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
our page 271 the other funds you
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
received in
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
the actual funds in 2020 were 1.4
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
and in the governor's recommended budget
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh you're looking to receive 2.6
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars so about a 1.2 million
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
dollar increase
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
where are those other funds coming from
 
00:53:41.359 --> 00:53:42.230 align:start position:0%
where are those other funds coming from
and

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
are you including any new fees or
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
increasing fees this year thanks no
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
and i i'm not my my numbers aren't quite
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
lining up but i'm looking at it
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
in 21 was other funds of
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
just over 2 million and then
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
2.6 some of that is a
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know i think a an ac a better
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
estimate of what those other funds for
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
those are all of our other fees
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
and and funds combined so the money that
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
that we keep for um the uh
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
scale and product testing fund that's a
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
fund that 50
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
goes to the state we keep 50
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
then we have the pet population control
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
that money
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
all goes out for spay and neutering
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
we have um the
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
the um pesticides the integrated
 
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.430 align:start position:0%
the um pesticides the integrated
pesticide

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
pesticide
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
fund that 75 goes to the state 25
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
comes comes there uh
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
and then all of our other licensing
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
through through
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
the divisions that's our our total
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
so i think some of this may have been um
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
we've done a better job of estimating
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
and of course things are
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
are going up and as we have more staff
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
we've actually been able to
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
to find a lot more people who should
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
have been registered and
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
licensed in very various areas that's a
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
huge problem when you're understaffed
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people who just simply
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
are not complying
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
voluntarily with the law and we have to
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh to find them
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of products out there that are
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
being sold and
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
pet food a lot now is being sold over
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
the internet and we're
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to how to deal
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
with that that's something that
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's dealing with in every state
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
all right thanks thanks madam chair
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative tubers
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you um
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
for being here commissioner
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
i have a question there seems to be an
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
overlap or at least i need clarification
 
00:55:57.359 --> 00:55:58.549 align:start position:0%
overlap or at least i need clarification
between

00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
what your department is doing and the
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
university system and extension
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
is there any type of correlation or
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
cooperation or collaboration
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
well there is an awful lot and we have
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
an awful uh
 
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
say awful waffles awful is a terrible
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
word to use for this
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
but there is a lot of cooperation
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
i i refer to uh unh cooperative
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
extension really as our sister
 
00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:23.990 align:start position:0%
extension really as our sister
organization

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
we're the regulatory branch they're the
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
educational branch
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
and of course that goes hand in hand
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
so there are contracts that we have with
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
and we work very very closely with them
 
00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.430 align:start position:0%
and we work very very closely with them
but

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that we do that they
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
also do and there's nothing
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we do that they also do so it's
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
really a glove in hand
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
i think you've answered all of our
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for doing that and i
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank michelle for looking up those
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
answers to some of those little
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions to make sure we have things
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
done correctly
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
and commissioner when we get down to hb2
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
we'll probably ask you to come back to
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
talk about that
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
new non-lapsing fund that is proposed
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
and the purpose
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
and what it's going to bring to us do
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
you have any questions for us
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%

with you today but we're all here to be
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%

00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate the opportunity
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
to testify before you today regarding
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget for
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
so you'll see in your presentation
 
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.349 align:start position:0%
so you'll see in your presentation
materials

00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
basically some overview of the state
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
agency and i just wanted to highlight
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
this because i think it really
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
sets the stage for some of our budget
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
requests as reflected in the governor's
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
so as you know plc is the state agency
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering 54
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
boards councils and commissions in the
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
as well as currently the prescription
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
drug monitoring program or pdmp
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
it is a new agency and it is certainly a
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
small agency with only 64 permanent
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
classified positions at present
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
however the impact on the state of new
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire is vast in
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 alone
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
oplc had 223 000 occupational licenses
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
that were active in new hampshire
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
under the agency and this figure
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
represents a 29
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
increase from fy 19 alone um it suffices
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
every person in the state of new
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire has interacted with this
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
agency or one of its licensees
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's important to know i think for
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
purposes of the budget of course
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
that oplc is a self-funded agency its
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
funding is restricted and must only be
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
used toward the cost of licensing and
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
enforcing the occupational licensing
 
01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
enforcing the occupational licensing
regulations

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
under under on the practice acts
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
so we're all aware that the purpose of
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
the boards under it
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
oplc is to protect the public and
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the general court has
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
concluded that we need to ensure that an
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
individual meets minimum standards
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to practice a particular
 
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.950 align:start position:0%
necessary to practice a particular
profession

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
profession
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
and we do that through occupational
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
licensing so when we think of it that
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
way occupational licensing
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
is um by its very nature a purposeful
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
barrier to workforce
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore it does play a vital role
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
in workforce and
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
impact in workforce on our community so
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
what is the agency's purpose
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the boards i would say that
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
oplc's purpose is a little bit different
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
our purpose is set forth in the statute
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
310a and it's really to promote
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency and economy in the
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
administration of these licensing boards
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
so our objective is to assist the boards
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
in protecting the public
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
while at the same time ensuring that
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
licensing is efficient
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
so as to reduce unnecessary workforce
 
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.589 align:start position:0%
so as to reduce unnecessary workforce
barriers

01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
and from my perspective the two major
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
barriers to workforce entry
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
in this state as it pertains to
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
licensing are the time it takes to
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
obtain a license
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
and the time it takes for someone to
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
re-enter the workforce after a complaint
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
has been filed
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
represented walls has a question for you
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
would you take it
 
01:01:57.359 --> 01:02:01.270 align:start position:0%
would you take it
absolutely

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
you're muted mary beth you're mute
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
you're muted i got it i i took a minute
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
um my question man i'm sure simply is uh
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
there's no documents either on the
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
lba website or in our email on this and
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if the
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
documents are available to those of us
 
01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
documents are available to those of us

remote
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's the same answer as i gave you
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
earlier mr hoffman is here alone he's
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
working as fast as he can
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
mrs lavinas had an electric problem
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
and so they will come up thank you i
 
01:02:32.799 --> 01:02:33.349 align:start position:0%
and so they will come up thank you i
just

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's fair answer i just didn't know if
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
i was missing something thank you
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
please continue thank you so through the
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended fy 22 and 23
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
budget the agency
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
will strive to eliminate unnecessary
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
workforce barriers by
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
accomplishing two things significantly
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
reducing the time frame for licensure
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
and significantly reducing the time
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
i do want to highlight um some of the
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
things that oplc is currently
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
working toward that that really falls
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
into place with
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
um some of our budget requests for fy 22
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
and 23.
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
we've been actively working to achieve
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
those two goals by using our existing
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
resources but of course we need some
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
additional assistance with funding
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
one of our top projects has been our
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
agency reorganization and you'll see
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
that that's reflected
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
um and the governor's recommended budget
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes that's in hb2 as well so we do all
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
have a draft copy of hp2 so we've been
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
able to read that
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
so we are going to want to walk through
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
that reorganization to understand it
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely from a historical background
 
01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
absolutely from a historical background
um

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
when oplc was created the boards and the
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
board staff were essentially just
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
um plopped into a structure that really
 
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.309 align:start position:0%
um plopped into a structure that really
resembled

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
resembled
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
what the structure had been for the
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
various boards that came over to oplc
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
um their staffing remained the same
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
their policies remained
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
the same the procedures remained the
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
same everything remained the
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
same except for their location obviously
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
that's my perspective
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
um and i think for several years uh they
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
operated essentially in the same manner
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
as they did prior to
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
plc's creation about a year ago
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
um we started on this project to really
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
to do a deeper dive to to make sure that
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're meeting our statutory mission and
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we observed was
 
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.349 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we observed was
that

01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
that agency structure was a barrier to
 
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:28.870 align:start position:0%
that agency structure was a barrier to
achieving

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
achieving
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
efficiencies many of our staff were
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
doing the same tasks
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
in many different ways in other words
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
you had
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
54 different ways of handling a
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
complaint you also had multiple people
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
touching complaints you had 54 different
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
ways of
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
processing a license and so we started
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
to develop
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
a project to reorganize the agency into
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
two divisions based on job function
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
again there are two primary purposes of
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
our agency which is to license
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
individuals and to conduct
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
investigations and so
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
we wanted to re to allocate our staff
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
based on those two
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
two primary functions um so we did um
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
we have started to move forward with
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
this through our physical relocation to
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
seven equal square which was
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
um not anticipated as i think you are
 
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
um not anticipated as i think you are
aware

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
um and so we started to move staff into
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
these functional
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
areas but the budget obviously is going
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
to formalize that process
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
so in july of 2020 um we began
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
reorganizing staff based on job function
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
in lieu of subject matter
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
boards and this has allowed us to really
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
take a deep look at what our procedures
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
and our policies and our rules are
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
regarding these two primary functions so
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we can be efficient we can't have
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
one way of
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
doing business instead of 54. we've also
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
centralized our male intake
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're handling mail
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
and also monies
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
on the same way through our finance
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
office instead of
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
through our license clerks that was
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
completed in december of 2020
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
we are centralizing our customer service
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
individual license clerks i'm fielding
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
various questions
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
we've created or are creating a customer
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
service uh
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
group the go live date for that is
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
mid-march in 2021
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
and we're working on adopting you know
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the same policies and procedures for all
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
boards concerning investigations and
 
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.109 align:start position:0%
boards concerning investigations and
licensing

01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
we've also embarked on a mission to
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
leverage technology where appropriate
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
so um previously we
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
have always had the my license office
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
enterprise solution i think that
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
dates back many years um but it was
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
essentially a first come first serve
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
whichever staff member
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to go online you know they
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
contacted the two duit people who are
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this project and
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
they got in line regardless of the
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
impact on the state or workforce
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
um so we've taken that on and we've
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
developed a project plan
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
and all licensing renewals will be
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
online by march 15th of this year
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
all licensing initial applications
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
should be online by the end of fy22
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've completely redesigned our website
 
01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:06.950 align:start position:0%
we've completely redesigned our website
that

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
website goes uh live on thursday i'm
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
very excited about that
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
and we're working on scanning in all of
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
our documentation um that was really
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
necessitated by the move from field work
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
um so that we can move all of our
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
documentation online
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
and streamline the processes so that's
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing and it really can
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
i ask you a question about this
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
of course many of the licenses
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
require on the job training or
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
regular training classes or whatever i
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
know real estate licenses they have to
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
complete so many courses are they going
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be able now to submit that
 
01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
to be able now to submit that
electronically

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
yes yes we don't want to have any paper
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
in the office because it
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
it really increases the amount of time
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
to have to manually process that
 
01:07:54.839 --> 01:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
to have to manually process that
information

01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
in addition we don't have any storage
 
01:08:00.799 --> 01:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
in addition we don't have any storage
space

01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
we've decreased our square footage
 
01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.630 align:start position:0%
we've decreased our square footage
significantly

01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
um so oplc3 the governor's recommended
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
budget proposes to continue to maximize
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and agency operations by
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
accomplishing several things
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
formally reorganizing the agency to
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
divide staff based on job function as i
 
01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
divide staff based on job function as i
noted

01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
noted
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
significantly reducing oplc's part-time
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
class 50 budget and utilizing those
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
funds to assist in
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
establishing full-time positions
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
historically oplc's
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
workforce about 20 has been part-time
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
and that's really been a barrier for
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
efficiencies it's difficult to find
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
part-time workers
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes people utilize part-time
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
positions as a stepping stone to
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
full-time employment elsewhere
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
and so we're constantly retraining and
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's just really not efficient or
 
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.189 align:start position:0%
it's it's just really not efficient or
productive

01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
productive
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
and then we'd also like to establish
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
oplc as 125
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
agency uh we have eliminated our double
 
01:09:00.239 --> 01:09:01.189 align:start position:0%
agency uh we have eliminated our double
accounting

01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
method to increase transparency in our
 
01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
method to increase transparency in our
finances

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
finances
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
and we've moved all expenses to
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
administration you'll see in this budget
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
um mainly because uh with the
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
reorganization it's unclear
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
um where the expenses will kind of fall
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
between the two divisions
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that historical
 
01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:21.269 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that historical
data

01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
finally technology you'll see class 27
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
has some you know
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
fairly large increases but our position
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that we need to make initial
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
investments in technology to greatly
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
increase efficiencies in licensing and
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions and reduced
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
workforce barriers
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
and as an aside i'll give you um i'll
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
give you a tidbit of information
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
with emergency order 15 the agency had
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
to act really quickly in order to
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
adopt an emergency licensing process and
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
um really anticipating that our
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
physicians and our nurses would be the
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
ones applying for these emergency
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
licenses to assist with copen 19.
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
what we observed was that the large very
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
large majority of those
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
initially applying for emergency
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
licenses were actually mental health
 
01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.590 align:start position:0%
licenses were actually mental health
providers

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
many of whom live in new hampshire but
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
work elsewhere and when you talk to
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
these providers they do not
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of them don't work in new
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire mainly because
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
um they were able to obtain employment
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
in other states barriers uh
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
their border states um more quickly
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
um because we know vermont for example
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
will turn around license times in 24
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
hours in massachusetts it's also beating
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
us in that
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
so there there's really a need for us to
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh on a workforce and for us to reduce
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
so to accomplish all of our objectives
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
oplc proposes through the governor's
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
recommended budget to increase
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
its fiscal year 2223 budget
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
um mainly in several categories
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh class 10 obviously that includes 11
 
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
uh class 10 obviously that includes 11
new

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
positions not including the mechanical
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
licensing board which is also slated to
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
come over to your plc
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
class 20. um that really is is
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see is a 200 000 increase but
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's mainly for credit card
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
processing fees as we move
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
everything online we will be taking in
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
more credit card payments
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
obviously and that 2.3 fee
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
um that is the average of credit card
 
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.510 align:start position:0%
um that is the average of credit card
fees

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
will eat up those costs our class 22
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
move to eagle square obviously our
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
increase in runs
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
where were you before you moved we were
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
at philbrook
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
right you're one of the philbrook people
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
just possible okay
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
so i did want to highlight two two key
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
components regarding the governor's
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
proposed budget
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
and i know that commissioner goulet is
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
presenting on class 27 but
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but class 27 is a key component of
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
um oplc's budget and how it's going to
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
basically move the agency forward and
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
achieving efficiencies
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
so in january 2020 oplc and doit
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
saw and obtained gnc approval to
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
establish an i.t manager and a business
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
analyst position within doit to be
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
embedded in the agency
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
and to permit oplc to accept and expend
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
funds for these positions
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
we were able to hire um this past fall
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll say that this has been a total
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
game changer for the agency um all of
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
the projects that i just mentioned
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of redesigning the website
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
redesigning a covid microsite
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
bringing all renewals online and
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
bringing all licensing online
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
all of that is through the work of these
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
two positions and
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet's um incredible
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
support with his agency
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
and in order for us to continue our
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
projects we certainly need to
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
um to continue to fund these positions
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
we also have some additional prioritized
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
needs that were included in the
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
we have the 400 000 initial fee for the
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
investigations and inspection software
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
right now all of our investigations are
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
done uh manually
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
with a paper process um same thing with
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
our inspections
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know our pharmacist will go out with
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
the paper
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know paper sheets as well as our
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists and draft-up
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
inspections and then we have to manually
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
upload them into our system that's
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
really inefficient
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
um and also it's not transparent for the
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
public we'd like to be able to post
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
those online
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
um we are in dire need of a document
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
management system
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
with our move to seven eagle square we
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
lost a significant amount of square
 
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.350 align:start position:0%
lost a significant amount of square
footage

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
footage
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
and by virtue of the fact that we do not
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
have an agency-wide retention policy
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
something that we're trying to
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
fix with senate bill 58 we
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
essentially have to retain all these
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
paper documents
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
so we've been scanning them in and
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
archives have been we are able to get
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
rid of our paper documents
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
but we need an actual way to store the
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
documents so that they're retrievable
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
and document management
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
will be a key part of that so are you
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
shipping your paper documents to
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
archives you said working with archives
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
so archives approved our policy that
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
allows us to
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
retain documents in electronic form um
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
and to get rid of the paper documents
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay that satisfies their retention but
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
we have not actually destroyed any paper
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
documents because we want to make sure
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
that we're consistent with our naming
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
conventions and have an actual
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
streamlined approach to storage at this
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
point so that they're retrievable
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome um so in terms
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
of class 10 one of the questions
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the division asked was what new
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
positions are contemplated in the
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed budget so within the
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
we had again requested to significantly
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
decrease our class 50 budget
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
and increase our class 10 budget in the
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget we've requested six
 
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget we've requested six
positions

01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
to include two hearing examiners an
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
administrator three
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
a program assistant are two program
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
assistants twos and an investigative
 
01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
assistants twos and an investigative
paralegal

01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
paralegal
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs includes
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
five positions and administrator three
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
two program assistant twos and
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
investigative paralegal
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
and program specialist four the
 
01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:20.070 align:start position:0%
and program specialist four the
governor's

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
proposed budget also contemplates
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
transferring seven existing positions
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
from the department of safety to oplc
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
and transferring five
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know six positions from oplc to the
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:33.990 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
for

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug monitoring program
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
talk about the safety transfer that's in
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
hiv too so we've all had an opportunity
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
to read that
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're acquiring a new board basically
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
aren't you
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes and how was that funded in safety
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's funded through uh license fees with
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
a mechanical licensing board
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
so they they're not spending
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
fewer general fund dollars for example
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
because these are
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
transferred to you is that correct
 
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.070 align:start position:0%
transferred to you is that correct
correct

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
and in you in your area they will be
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
funded by the same license fees yes yes
 
01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
funded by the same license fees yes yes
correct

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
and they had seven and you're taking all
 
01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
and they had seven and you're taking all
seven

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
they had nine and in discussions with
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
apparently two of those positions were
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
doing work
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
um essentially unrelated to
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
the inspections or the licensing for the
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
mechanical board i think they also do
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
some fireworks licensing um
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
tobacco some other things and they they
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
retain those two and so the positions
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
that are coming over are six inspectors
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
and a program assistant too
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
and what are you sending to hhs you're
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
sending the pdmp
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes and it's staff
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
did did you have six staff with that
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
so we have um let's see we have the
 
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.510 align:start position:0%
so we have um let's see we have the
program

01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
administrator one that's a um that's a
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
full-time permanent classified employee
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
then there's
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
um she has two
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
permanent classified employees and then
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
she recently obtained approval for
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
three on nine t's
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
that are funded directly by the cdc
 
01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.189 align:start position:0%
that are funded directly by the cdc
grant

01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're sub-guarantee of hhs
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
so those are temporary positions
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
she got some general funds last biennium
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
didn't she
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
there it's actually agency funds i think
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
she she previously received general
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
funds but the agency has paid for
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
mark's position and how will this
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
are you transferring funds to hhs
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
we're not transferring funds at the
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
moment to hhs we do have statutory
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
um uh we do have statutory authority to
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
send over licensing fees
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
to support hhs hhs are i'm sorry the
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
pdmp with the exception of one position
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
is um completely funded through grants
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
so in terms of whether our agency is
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
adequately staffed to complete all work
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
assigned under state law i would say
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes under the governor's proposed
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
um without the without the additional
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
personnel and i t support contemplated
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
there will be backlogs of licensing
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
leading to
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
workforce barriers and reduced workforce
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
availability in the state
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
um as i explained earlier um
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
vermont is really beating us uh in terms
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
of healthcare
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
workforce uh being able to turn over
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
licenses quickly
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
we've alleviated some of that by
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
granting the agency instead of the
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
boards the ability to
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
issue temporary licenses and we are
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
doing that in 24 business hours or less
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
um which has definitely helped um
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
but in order in order to really be
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
competitive in workforce we need
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
additional staff to support our
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
licensing and investigative efforts
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
i would say that oplc historically has
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
it has not
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
been sufficiently staffed much of our
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
workforce is part time
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
so we have that constant turning of
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
positions we also only have 17 licensed
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
clerks to manage nearly 230 active
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
230 000 active licensees
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
um as an as an example when the
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
emergency licensing process was created
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
i personally spent the better part of
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
two weeks manually licensing people
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
until about midnight at my kitchen table
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
and we just didn't have anybody to do it
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
um the average board administrator has
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
at least five boards to administer
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the boards traditionally meet
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
monthly and prior to some
 
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.950 align:start position:0%
monthly and prior to some
reclassifications

01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
reclassifications
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
that we did for personnel this fiscal
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
year we did not even have one attorney
 
01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in the building
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
um cases were not being prosecuted or
 
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.229 align:start position:0%
um cases were not being prosecuted or
investigated

01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
when we moved over um to uh eagle square
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
and as part of our reorganization
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
project we found
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
many many many cases that um needed to
 
01:20:11.199 --> 01:20:11.510 align:start position:0%
many many many cases that um needed to
be

01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
investigated and we're pretty much done
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
through the backlog
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
um but without additional resources it's
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to be able to keep up
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh what things are we doing in state law
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
that could be eliminated
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
um i i would say i have a laundry list
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
of money this has been speaking for a
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
moment we've had an electrical glitch
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to be in recess we've
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
had an electrical glitch
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
give us five minutes to get scott in
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
here to
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
take care of this where the high wind
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
the electricity is going on and off so
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
no one outside can hear no one in this
 
01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:56.709 align:start position:0%
no one outside can hear no one in this
room

01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
can hear the only reason you can hear me
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
is i have my surface
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
pro here so i'm hooked up to the network
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
separately so bear with us while we get
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
him in here
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
he's here already working madame
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
chair we uh can hear i can hear just
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
from the public is back
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
listening lindsay i appreciate your
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
willingness to suspend when you're on a
 
01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:17.030 align:start position:0%
willingness to suspend when you're on a
roll

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
roll
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
but we are functioning again so let's
 
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.350 align:start position:0%
but we are functioning again so let's
continue

01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate it um so in terms
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the things that could be
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
um eliminated that are that we're
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
presently doing
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
um rather than list them all
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
i i attached our um copy of my testimony
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
in support of
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
the oplc's three major bills um
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cleanup that needs to
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
take place among the practice acts
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
in order to uh you know basically allow
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
us to move forward with our efficiencies
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
one of which is senate bill 13 um
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
that clarifies that oplc has the
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt fees for all boards
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
councils and commissions
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
um presently boards have retained that
 
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.470 align:start position:0%
um presently boards have retained that
authority

01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the practice acts and so
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're kind of at a standstill
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
in being able to make any modifications
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
regarding fees
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
um there are other things that we're
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
doing in state law or that we are
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
required to be doing in state law that
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
really is inefficient
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
um one being that requiring a court
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
stenographer to be present for all
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
hearings we
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
record all hearings and it's later
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
transcribed but a stunner was really not
 
01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:28.390 align:start position:0%
transcribed but a stunner was really not
necessary

01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and then um you know
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
removing requirements that we provide a
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
roster of licensees for a fee
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
obviously rosters are required to be
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
produced under 91a
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
accepting private information and so um
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
that additional requirement that we keep
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
on uh a
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know separate roster on file is
 
01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
you know separate roster on file is
really

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
does not make sense um and
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know there are certain reporting
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have under 332g
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
for title iii boards that don't fall
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
within our agencies so
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
there are some things that need to be
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
done and that's in senate bill
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
58 and then finally in senate bill um
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 133 um
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry hold on one moment
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes this makes some changes regarding
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
our investigations and our rulemaking
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
authority regarding investigations which
 
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
authority regarding investigations which
is

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be clarified um versus the
 
01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
needs to be clarified um versus the
board's

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
board's
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh rule making authority over
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
investigations and so that's reflected
 
01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.750 align:start position:0%
investigations and so that's reflected
in

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
senate bill um 133
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'm happy at this point to go through
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
some line items or i'm happy to just
 
01:23:49.199 --> 01:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
some line items or i'm happy to just
answer

01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
questions what do you think would be
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative leishman has his hands up
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i believe it's on roughly page nine
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
first handout you gave us and you asked
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
for at least 11 new positions and of
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
course the transfer of seven
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
so do you have a cost to those uh
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
new positions the 11 plus will there be
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
any revenue generated from those
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
positions i would assume
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps some additional revenue through
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement or
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
other actions do you have anything that
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
you could give us on that
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes so the um
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
we can add up the cost for you um i
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
think it's roughly
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
the cost is set forth in the letter in
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
terms of salary benefits the full cost
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
of each position
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
we do have existing revenue um so oplc
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
at present um is taking in
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
i think this year we're anticipated to
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
take in about
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
13 million dollars next year i'm
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
projecting about
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
14 million dollars that's pretty
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
conservative with the addition of the
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board and the fact
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
that our license
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
at the number of licenses have continued
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so we are certainly able to fund
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
these additional positions particularly
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
given the fact that our class 40
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
our class 50 budget is anticipated to
 
01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:22.310 align:start position:0%
our class 50 budget is anticipated to
decrease

01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
about 400 000 um
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
and so this would just mean obviously
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
that the lapse to the general fund is
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
is less than what it presently is but we
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up yes
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
are there other questions at this moment
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative hatch is that your
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is madam chair thank you yeah just
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
just uh uh we started a conversation
 
01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:51.830 align:start position:0%
just uh uh we started a conversation
about

01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh your training classes and we added an
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
additional one
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
to help with rules and and i was just
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
wondering if that was adequate there
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
still seems to be some
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
um improvement needed and and if you
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
could just speak to that or do
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
or do you have an additional need or
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on there you may
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i would say we still have a backlog
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work our way through the
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
backlog as you know
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
oplc does about 20 percent of the
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
state's rulemaking
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
um and prior to you adding on that
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
additional position
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
we had one attorney who provides all of
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
our general legal counsel to the agency
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
the 54 boards councils and commissions
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
does all the rulemaking and now is our
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot of work obviously and it
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
has created a backlog
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we were kind of into
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
catch-22 in terms of what to do with
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
that additional uh attorney position
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
without having a prosecutor in-house um
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
we were not able to prosecute or
 
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
we were not able to prosecute or
investigate

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of cases um and so in terms of
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
meeting our statutory obligations i made
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the decision that i thought that a
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
backlog on rules was a little bit better
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
than having
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh no prosecutions or investigations so
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
we've reclassified that
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
extra that additional attorney position
 
01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:04.790 align:start position:0%
extra that additional attorney position
to

01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
an administrative prosecutor position so
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we can at least prosecute cases
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
we also reclassified um
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
another position though to add on a
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
program specialist for position
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
to assist tom broderick with role making
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
and he and tina kelly are working
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
through the backlog
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
as quickly as they can um and she she's
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
great at being able to provide that
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
role-making support
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think what's lacking though is is an
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
attorney to be able to provide
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
that legal support to the boards um that
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
obviously team is not able to provide
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
so so if i may not have a chair just
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
just to explore this
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm not hearing that
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
there's not a need for another position
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
just just to uh point out that
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
um rule making may seem less important
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
than hearings but understand you you
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
have a plethora of rules expired
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
and you know what happens when they're
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
expired they're not enforceable
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
and it could be a very serious problem
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
as well as a licensing board ad
 
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.350 align:start position:0%
as well as a licensing board ad
infinitum

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
infinitum
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
so is there a still a need for another
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
position because that
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
that concern certainly needs to be
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
addressed it really does
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i agree with you
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative hatch and what we had
 
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.189 align:start position:0%
representative hatch and what we had
recommended

01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
um in the agency submission is and
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
we we recommended one hearings examiner
 
01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:25.350 align:start position:0%
we we recommended one hearings examiner
position

01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
and one attorney position and the
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget contains
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
um no attorney positions and two
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
hearings examiner positions
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
our recommendation obviously you know we
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
support the governor's recommendation
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
but from an agency need we certainly do
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
need another attorney position
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
because i agree with your assessment
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
lindsey could we turn to page 195
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
and since you've done such a massive
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
reorganization which i understand why
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
you've done it and i applaud you for
 
01:28:59.280 --> 01:28:59.990 align:start position:0%
you've done it and i applaud you for
bringing

01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
more efficiency page 195 in the budget
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
does present a summary of your agency so
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
without trying to look at accounting
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
unit to accounting unit
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
why is this zero why is that down why
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't we look at this summary and why
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't you walk us through
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
starting with federal funds all the way
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
down through the total number of
 
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.870 align:start position:0%
down through the total number of
positions

01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
and talk to us about this page
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely let me just pull up so i make
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
sure that i'm looking at the right
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
i was working off of um our condensed
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.840 --> 01:30:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
195.

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm on the right page jason
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
do you know what
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
it would be the last page of the
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
budget

01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that was page 195. in our budget
 
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.149 align:start position:0%
and that was page 195. in our budget
books

01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
lindsay and we we have the printed
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
budget books so
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%

01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
gone through
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
several iterations with the governor yes
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
we just have what came out okay
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
um so i gave you our page number because
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we have so i have at the top
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
i have you know the administration
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
class 10 that's what i'm looking at is
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
that what you're looking at
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
no the last page starts with zero one
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
general government
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
expenditure total for general government
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
federal fund funding general funds
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
other funds then we get down to net
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
total funds
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
number of positions permanent classified
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
unclassified total number of positions
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%

got it um i apologize
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
no problem so much
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're glad we haven't gone through three
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:44.070 align:start position:0%
oh here we go
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:50.310 align:start position:0%
oh here we go
[Music]

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
he's muted yeah
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
yeah let me pull it up and i'll email
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
you a copy thank you
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i'm looking at
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
or jason can run us through it i i don't
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
care i just
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
since there's been such a difference in
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:32.149 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then chairman while we're waiting
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
may i ask a question
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
yes so i'm trying to understand uh
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
lindsay do you receive general funds or
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
are you fully self-funded
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
we are fully self-funded we do not
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
receive any general funds
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
so to that end in your presentation
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
which i eventually found you mentioned
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
that it's going to cause delays i think
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's on page 10 of your presentation
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
um delays if you don't have more staff
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you need legal staff and
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
i.t staff
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
and so if we were to
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
give you the funding for that staff out
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
of your own revenues
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
how much would you need
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
um i think it amounts to
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
so not accounting for pdmp
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
and non-accounting for um mechanical
 
01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:37.750 align:start position:0%
and non-accounting for um mechanical
licensing

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
we would need in fiscal year 22
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
11 0.9 million dollars
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 12.2 million
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
if we added in the appropriations for
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing there was um
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
class 10 and class 60 i believe we'd
 
01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.310 align:start position:0%
class 10 and class 60 i believe we'd
need

01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
12.6 and fiscal year 22
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
and 12.9 in fiscal year 2023
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
and again i'm still projecting um just
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
based on our current fees
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
um a projected revenue of about 14
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
and we have that on page 194 for people
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
so if i may follow up with those numbers
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
how how what's the difference between
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
those numbers and the amount of money
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're actually getting are you saying
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's like 12.6
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
additional money and 12.9 additional
 
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.550 align:start position:0%
additional money and 12.9 additional
money

01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
no um it ends up being so
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
so it ends up being about a difference
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
of 1.5 million dollars
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 2022 and about
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
1.7 million dollars in fiscal year 2023
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
compared to the adjusted authorization
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2021.
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
so um to put it this way so we lapsed
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
um last year we lapsed about 3.2 million
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to the general fund our last
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
target this year is 3.6
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that would effectively reduce our
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
laps by a million and a half or 1.7
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars across
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know each fiscal year 22 and 23.
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so i have it up here um
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
lindsay you had a net increase of 18
 
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.470 align:start position:0%
lindsay you had a net increase of 18
people

01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
you lost pdmp you gained you reorganized
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
and you added some new people
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
of course that being said we are
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
reducing our class 50 so right now our
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
we actually have more bodies in the
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
building than the 66
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
that are reflected in terms absolutely
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
class 50 doesn't show
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
in the uh because they're part-time
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
and the permanent one so i was looking
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
at your permanent new
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
full-time positions with the loss
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the new with the transfer out of
 
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.830 align:start position:0%
with the new with the transfer out of
safety

01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
which is in hb2 you went up
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
18. 18. and they don't they
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
um das who does the budgets for us does
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
not total up
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
the number of part-time people right
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
right how many new part-time people do
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
did you have
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
how many new we don't have any new
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
part-time positions we would have to
 
01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.470 align:start position:0%
part-time positions we would have to
convert

01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
convert
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
we we will have to effectively eliminate
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
um positions i think right now
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
joe how many do you think we have i
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
think we have about
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
13 to 15 part-time positions at the
 
01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
13 to 15 part-time positions at the
moment

01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
at any given time it's about 20 percent
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah correct i think last time i looked
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
it was 15 and it's always been
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 20
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
and what do they do for you
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
they fill major functions um so right
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
now our administrator three who's in
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
charge of all of licensing
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
is part time he's you know retiring in
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
june and one of the positions that we've
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
suggested be created as an administrator
 
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.350 align:start position:0%
suggested be created as an administrator
3

01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
3
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can have a full-time
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
supervisor overseeing licensing
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
we have one part-time investigator
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then we have a number of part-time
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
license clerks and
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
there was a performance audit of the
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
real estate board
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
that had significant number of findings
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
that needed to be
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
addressed as part of your reorg
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
how are you handling some of those
 
01:37:45.679 --> 01:37:47.350 align:start position:0%
how are you handling some of those
deficiencies

01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
and did you have did the mix of staff
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
you got
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
we see that so let me pull up the actual
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
notes from the findings because i don't
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
i would say that the personnel that have
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
been proposed are intended to address
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
issues that have been long-standing in
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
the agency regarding performance
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
so um yes so we had several
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the agency regarding
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
the real estate audit one was
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
improved supervision number licensing
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
activities um the recommendation
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
to oplc is to update and formalize
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
licensing policies and procedure
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
procedures um we're presently doing that
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
right now is updating all policies and
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
procedures through our reorganization
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to standardize policies and
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
procedures regarding how we
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
options but certainly having an
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
administrator in a full-time position
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
overseeing all of that
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
is going to help you know um meet our
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
our requirements or performance
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
requirements under the audit
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
so this budget has that administrator
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll help you in that area
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
correct correct
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
um recommendations for improving fiscal
 
01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
um recommendations for improving fiscal
management

01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the recommendation related to our plc
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
was to improve fiscal management
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities by developing a cost
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
allocation method more reflective of the
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
cost to operate each cord
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
i would tell you that the cost
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
allocation method that plc has
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
historically used is one based on
 
01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.709 align:start position:0%
historically used is one based on
revenue

01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
we are that's not obviously the best way
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
to be doing that
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
we're moving to a cost allocation method
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
based on the number of licensees
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
as we consolidate and as we move forward
 
01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.910 align:start position:0%
as we consolidate and as we move forward
with

01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
our reorganization the shared costs are
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
going up
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
and the direct costs that are trivial to
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
each board are going significantly down
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
um so sharing those shared costs based
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
on the number of licensing i think is
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
going to be a more accurate reflection
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the actual cost
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
um to each individual licensee and
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
review administrative rules um with the
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
support of oplc improvements rules and
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
adoption of rules i think this goes back
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
to our conversation
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
earlier with representative hatch
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
obviously oplc
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
had requested an additional attorney
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
that i think would assist with
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
role-making support
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
um and um i think certainly that
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
additional position
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
in lieu of one of our hearing examiner's
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
positions would assist with that
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
um the observation to improve records
 
01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:39.830 align:start position:0%
um the observation to improve records
management

01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
develop procedures to implement policies
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
and facilitate the development of
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
records management program this goes to
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
our class
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
27 request specifically a document
 
01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.070 align:start position:0%
27 request specifically a document
management

01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
system so that records are easily um
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know retained and are easily
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
retrievable in accordance with a
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
retention policy
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
we also have um senate bill 58 i believe
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
um would grant or feel see the authority
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
to adapt
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
to adopt a retention policy across the
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
agency one of the issues that we run
 
01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:11.350 align:start position:0%
agency one of the issues that we run
into

01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
is the fact that all of these boards
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
have varying retention policies or none
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
at all so then we fall back on the
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
state's um regular retention policy
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
makes it very difficult for us to
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
actually manage files
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
and keep track of what files can be
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
destroyed and must be destroyed and
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
which files must be retained
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we need to do is
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're being consistent
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
in how we approach the same types of
 
01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:34.390 align:start position:0%
in how we approach the same types of
trials

01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
trials
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
um further clarify and document uh real
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
estate commission
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
or plc rules and responsibilities um
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
certainly ongoing through our
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
reorganization i think um
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think i think also this legislative
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
session i'm
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
hoping will help clarify the difference
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
in the two
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
roles i think that there is not yet a
 
01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:55.830 align:start position:0%
roles i think that there is not yet a
consensus

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the state about what the purpose of
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
april plc is versus the boards
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
and certainly the reorganization and
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
having streamlined policies and
 
01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:04.950 align:start position:0%
having streamlined policies and
procedures

01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
are going to assist with better defining
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
those goals and establishing a
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
performance measurement system that's
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
something that we're working with
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
um now as as we develop our strategic
 
01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:17.910 align:start position:0%
um now as as we develop our strategic
planning

01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
planning
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
um going forward so i think the budget
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
does accurately reflect or it does
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
intend to address
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
all of the findings in the real estate
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
audit but the other audits as well
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
which are primarily related to you know
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
providing the
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate administrative support
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
to the boards
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
i have one last question for you as i
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
understand what i read in hb2
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
about the oplc which was a long section
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
and listening to you today
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
if you do not get the section in the
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
sections in
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
hb2 related to oplc
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
you basically can't
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
manage the budget you've presented here
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
either they're
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
tied together as i think i understand
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
what i read and what you said is that
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from any board
 
01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
any other questions from any board
member

01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative leishman uh thank you
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair and
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
good presentation but i do have a
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
oplc position crosswalk it's one of the
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
documents that we were given
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
and on i think it's page
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
four it lists the
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh executive director of oplc
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
twice and there's two salary lines one
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
for a hundred and seventy nine thousand
 
01:43:50.239 --> 01:43:51.669 align:start position:0%
for a hundred and seventy nine thousand
and

01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
for a 194 000 and i didn't see
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
too many uh comparisons where jobs were
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
listed twice
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
for the same position especially like
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
for the executive director twice
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
do you see that on it's page page four
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's positions three and four in that
 
01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.229 align:start position:0%
it's positions three and four in that
document

01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
from the top down let me
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
pull it up it's the last page of your
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
crosswalk

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the org chart you presented it looks
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
like you have an executive director over
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
division of health health professionals
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
technical professions and
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
admin plus a second executive director
 
01:45:08.239 --> 01:45:09.030 align:start position:0%
admin plus a second executive director
over

01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
division of licensing enforcement and
 
01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:12.790 align:start position:0%
division of licensing enforcement and
admin

01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
admin
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
do you have yes positions no there's one
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
position and what this represents is the
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
the total cost for fiscal year 22 with
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
is 179 000 approximately and the
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
total cost for fiscal year 23 it goes up
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
obviously with the increase um increase
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
and there's an increase in salary and
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
presumably benefits as well
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay because there was no indication
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
on here
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
i thought maybe that was it but it
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
didn't say so
 
01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.470 align:start position:0%
didn't say so
curious

01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
our those are the items in our budget
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
starting with the
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
i finally have the page the right page
 
01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.070 align:start position:0%
i finally have the page the right page
that

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
that i was supposed to be on if that
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
sure okay but you need to give us the
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
page yeah so i think you were on
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
one one last page we looked at was 194
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at the addition of
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
madam chair this is mike i believe the
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
page that
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
oplc starts on is 180 186
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
and yes mike that's true by 200 we're in
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
another agency
 
01:46:46.719 --> 01:46:50.229 align:start position:0%
another agency
okay

01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm at the top general government
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay 2404 is on page 186
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay so class 10
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
obviously there's an increase basically
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
between 463 000
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 21 and fiscally your 22
 
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
year goes up to
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
573 thousand that's when the addition of
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
one position reflected it's the hearing
 
01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:21.990 align:start position:0%
one position reflected it's the hearing
examiner

01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
examiner
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
position reflected um and the governor's
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
proposed recommended budget
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
with class 11 um there was an increase
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
basically the fiscal year 20 in fiscal
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
did not contemplate um my position
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
starting off on the
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
the step that i did and so 22 and 23
 
01:47:41.199 --> 01:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
the step that i did and so 22 and 23
represent

01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
um purpose salary increases for our one
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
unclassified position
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
in administration which is the executive
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
director position
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
class 20 current expenses
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:16.830 align:start position:0%
 
sheet

01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
so the you know we have approximately 75
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
000 in supplies
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with what um fy 20
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
was which was 16
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
about 69 000 um
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have the largest expense is credit
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
card processing services
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
in fy 2020 it was approximately 150 000
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended budget and
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
we estimated about 300 000
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
for credit card processing fees based on
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
on the number of
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
credit card transactions that we we
 
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:52.629 align:start position:0%
credit card transactions that we we
anticipate

01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
um capturing um through our online
 
01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:56.790 align:start position:0%
um capturing um through our online
licensing

01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
um that also includes about about
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in postage
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with what we spent
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
in fra 2020 which is 97
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
000 um and a couple of other
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
smaller line items um class 22 is new
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's fairly new for us this year at
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
least in the large amounts
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
um previously i think we had some
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
storage expenses in class 20 and class
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
21 or i'm sorry in fiscal year 20 fiscal
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
year 21.
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
we did have to physically relocate um
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
to a non-state building back in july and
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
393 000 is our anticipated cost
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
for rents to leases other than states
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
organizational dues you'll see that
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
class 26
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
um previously had zero but that
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
that is just um for administration only
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
across the agency we actually
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
had um spent sixty two thousand three
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
hundred and fourteen dollars in fiscal
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
year twenty
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
and were authorized to spend eighty two
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
thousand two hundred and ninety two
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
um and so we've moved all expenses over
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
to administration
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
and so the fy 2022 and fy 2023 really
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
line up with our adjusted authorization
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
for 21
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
and that it's 87 000
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
um our organizational dues are
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
historically statutorily required for us
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
to participate in oftentimes our
 
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
to participate in oftentimes our
organizations

01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
um like national council for state
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
boards of nursing or the real estate
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
organization provide a vital examination
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
or exams or that sort of activity for us
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
historically required to participate in
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
them um as a matter of statute
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
so class 27 is um that's
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
that is a large increase transfers to
 
01:50:50.159 --> 01:50:51.350 align:start position:0%
that is a large increase transfers to
oit

01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
oit
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
um 473 000 in fiscal year 2020
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
we're up um additional authorization in
 
01:50:58.719 --> 01:50:59.629 align:start position:0%
we're up um additional authorization in
2021

01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
718 but obviously the governor's
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
recommended budget includes
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
a recommended appropriation of 1.2
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars and fiscal year 22 and
 
01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:09.750 align:start position:0%
million dollars and fiscal year 22 and
won

01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
won
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
um 1 million 66 000
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year um 2023
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
and that really um the breakdown is
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
based on shared costs from doit
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
as well as upgrades as well as the cost
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
of our two it consultants
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
um additionally and i know commissioner
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
belay has gone over this
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
our board members do not have um
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
state-issued email addresses which
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
really poses a problem from a 91a
 
01:51:37.199 --> 01:51:38.390 align:start position:0%
really poses a problem from a 91a
standpoint

01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
um and so they've made some
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations for technology for that
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
and then finally our additional
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs regarding the
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
inspection software and the
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
investigation software and the document
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
management system so that's
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
essentially a one-time initial fee in
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and 23.
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
transfers to general services class 28
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
although this states that an admin
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
um it was 25 000
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
if we're going on agency-wide we really
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
spent in fiscal year 2020 267
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
000 um and then fiscal year 2021 we were
 
01:52:18.159 --> 01:52:19.109 align:start position:0%
000 um and then fiscal year 2021 we were
authorized

01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
264 000 this um was our rent for the
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
philbrook building
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
which was um owned by owned by the state
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
but obviously we paid a das
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
we have um the governor has recommended
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
have an appropriation of about forty
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars we are still
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
renting some storage space
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
in the walker building so that's
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
intended to capture that
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
our class 30. so
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
this shows that we previously had zero
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
dollars in admin
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
we did have about 12 000 that we spent
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
in other divisions and that 17 000
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
is authorized in 2021 this is really for
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle replacement we have a number of
 
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
vehicle replacement we have a number of
vehicles

01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
um for inspectors that are about ready
 
01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
um for inspectors that are about ready
to

01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
die and need to be replaced and so
 
01:53:11.119 --> 01:53:11.589 align:start position:0%
die and need to be replaced and so
that's

01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
um where that 50 000 uh comes into play
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
our class 38 technology and software
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
um so generally
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
so so that's intended to allow us to
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
have adobe pro software
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 2020 we spent about
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
twenty two hundred dollars in that
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
um we are authorized eleven thousand
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
dollars i'm not sure why
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
why this significant jump on fiscal year
 
01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.030 align:start position:0%
why this significant jump on fiscal year
2021

01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
we've estimated that we need another
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars to keep renewing
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
that subscription of adobe pro
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
which in this electronic age is really
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to be able to edit
 
01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.750 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to be able to edit
documents

01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
documents
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
um class 39 telecommunications
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
for admin in 2020 obviously we spent 4
 
01:53:57.599 --> 01:53:58.950 align:start position:0%
for admin in 2020 obviously we spent 4
800

01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
800
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
agency-wide we spent about 51 thousand
 
01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
agency-wide we spent about 51 thousand
dollars

01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2021 for admin we were
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
forty authorized hundred dollars but we
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
are agency wide authorized
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
fifty three thousand four hundred and
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
eighty four dollars so
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
the increase is really just intended to
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
capture additional positions
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
and obviously the increase in cost so
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
we've estimated sixty four thousand five
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars for
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
telecom across 22 and 23.
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
our indirect costs um interestingly
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
so this previously captured both our
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
self billing as well as cap starting in
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
22 and 23. it's only going to capture
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
spy cap and not
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
self-filling so um class 40
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
for um admin 181
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
000. um it actually was significantly
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
more than that
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
when we look at agency-wide class 40 was
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
agency-wide class 40 was 2 million 471
 
01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:09.750 align:start position:0%
agency-wide class 40 was 2 million 471
000

01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
in um in fiscal year uh 20
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 2021
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
4 million four hundred and forty three
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
again that includes our self billing so
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
one of the other reasons why we want to
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
do away with the self billing
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
is that it's not transparent and how
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
much you're actually spending
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
so obviously the recommended or what
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
they've estimated our supply cap to be
 
01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:35.830 align:start position:0%
they've estimated our supply cap to be
for

01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and 23 is you know 1
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
million 131
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
000 class 46 is our
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
consultant again it shows that we didn't
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
um have any
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh payments out of this and
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
administration but
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
agency-wide and fiscal year 20 we had 51
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
580. in fiscal year 21 we're authorized
 
01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:58.830 align:start position:0%
580. in fiscal year 21 we're authorized
71

01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
71
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
452 um we're statutorily required to
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
contract the physician investigator for
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
the board of
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
medicine mainly and at present
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that cost us 55 000 annually
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
we also have a contract with a dental
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
hygienist um to conduct inspection
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
inspections and investigations when uh
 
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:19.910 align:start position:0%
inspections and investigations when uh
needed

01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that contract is not anticipated to
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
exceed ten thousand dollars so that's
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
intended to capture
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
that um class 49 transfers to other
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
state agencies
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
this would really be our doj support our
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
department of justice support
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
so while we didn't have any allocated or
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
spent any in administration in fiscal
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
year 20.
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
we did agency-wide 678 thousand dollars
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2021 we are appropriated
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
690 000
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
and these numbers for 2022 and 2023 i
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
believe are based on
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
doj's our recommendations
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
class 50 you'll see um that
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh our our temporary um our class 50
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
positions in fy 2020 and admin we had 31
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
000 but agency-wide we had approximately
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
520 000.
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
um in fy 2021 we had
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
agency-wide 453 000
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated and um
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating to significantly
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
reduce that
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
agency-wide um to
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
156 000 in fiscal year 2022
 
01:57:39.070 --> 01:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
and 162 thousand dollars in fiscal year
 
01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.669 align:start position:0%
and 162 thousand dollars in fiscal year
2023.

01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
2023.
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
um class 57 um
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
in admin we we didn't have any money um
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
any funding spent out of this in
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
administration but we did
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
spend about two thousand dollars in
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we had 3 000 appropriated in fiscal
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
year 21.
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
this is really where required um our
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
electricians our electrical inspectors
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
are required to keep
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
um inspection manuals so they have the
 
01:58:06.719 --> 01:58:07.189 align:start position:0%
um inspection manuals so they have the
update

01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
update
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
updated code so we need a small amount
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
of appropriations to make sure that we
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
have access to those materials
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
um obviously class 60 benefits class 61
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
62 we don't control that 64. 65 are
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
board expenses
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
so we did not pay any board expenses out
 
01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:27.750 align:start position:0%
so we did not pay any board expenses out
of

01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
class 65 in administration and in 20 or
 
01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:31.510 align:start position:0%
class 65 in administration and in 20 or
21

01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
21
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
however we are moving all expenses to or
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
proposing to move all expenses to
 
01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:36.709 align:start position:0%
proposing to move all expenses to
administration

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 2020 we had we spent
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
134 000
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
at a class 65 um across the agency
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
and 144 000 is authorized in 2021
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
we are proposing an increase as
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
recommended through the governor's
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
budget to 208 000
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
and this really captures our per diem
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
for our board members
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we're trying to
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
address in legislation this year
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
is to allow oplc to adapt or to
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules regarding perdiems
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
across all boards
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
right now the majority of health boards
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
the large majority of health boards
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
receive a per diem but it it varies
 
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.030 align:start position:0%
receive a per diem but it it varies
between

01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
five dollars and hundred dollars it also
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
varies depending you know certain amount
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
of work needs to be performed that
 
01:59:20.719 --> 01:59:21.669 align:start position:0%
of work needs to be performed that
varies

01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
varies
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of our technical boards do
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
not receive a per game so we want to
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're being consistent
 
01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:26.950 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're being consistent
and

01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
and the work that's being performed and
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
also so that oplc can effectively budget
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
we do have issues right now with you
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
know um
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
to project how much we're going to be
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
spending in per diems
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
particularly for those boards that
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
receive payment for any work perform
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's board related it's hard to
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know um how much you're
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
going to spend
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
so we are projecting a slight increase
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
class 70 and state travel reimbursement
 
01:59:59.360 --> 01:59:59.990 align:start position:0%
class 70 and state travel reimbursement
um

01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
obviously for fiscal year 20 we spent
 
02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:03.270 align:start position:0%
obviously for fiscal year 20 we spent
607

02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
607
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
in um admin but agency-wide we spent 70
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
439 uh dollars and fiscal year
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
2021 where i raised 124 275
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
agency-wide and um agency-wide we are
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
projecting um through the governor's
 
02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:21.750 align:start position:0%
projecting um through the governor's
recommended

02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
budget uh a need for 47 thousand dollars
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 and 23.
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
class 27 really goes to our
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
mileage reimbursements for our board
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
members that we're statutorily required
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating a decrease um in
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 uh assuming that
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
um some continuation of remote meetings
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
is possible
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
but obviously if it's not possible um
 
02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:48.790 align:start position:0%
but obviously if it's not possible um
those

02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
those numbers may need to be adjusted um
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
um in terms of out-of-state travel we
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
have very limited out-of-state travel
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
all of our out-of-state travel
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
is paid by the various
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
conferences that we have to attend
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
through the professional association
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
so um ncsbn for example the national
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
council of state boards of nursing
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
will pay for a board member and or staff
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
member to go to their annual meeting
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
um and um so our
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
so sometimes our staff members and our
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
board members attend out-of-state
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
for out-of-state travel um i don't
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
anticipate any of that
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
this year um because all of our meetings
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
are being held
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
virtually but perhaps in fiscal year 20
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 2023
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
um we are eliminating our class 89
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
transfers to the as maintenance fund
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
because we're no longer
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
being maintained by eas and
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh 531 i'll skip over 211 because that
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
has to do with our property and casualty
 
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.070 align:start position:0%
has to do with our property and casualty
insurance

02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
um 531 has to do with our professionals
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
health program
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
which we contract with new hampshire php
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
provide these services in terms of
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring and
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
um for our for 13 of our boards
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
as part of the contract though we are
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
able to add on additional boards and a
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
cost of eight dollars per licensee
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know plc is effectively able to
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
prompt we're seeking
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
or seeking legislation to allow us to
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
congregate rules
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
um to adopt fees uh to
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
to to basically um
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
get the cost of that um covered by
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
licensing fees
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
um we'd like as many boards to be able
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
to participate in this php program as
 
02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.390 align:start position:0%
to participate in this php program as
possible

02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
but we are anticipating that um the 13
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
boards will remain at least work fiscal
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
year 2022
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
um so moving on um to the next page our
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
occ license review and uh reform
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
that was our um project we were funded
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
we received grant funds through the
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
department of labor we contracted with
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
a clear council of licensing and
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement and regulation
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
to provide an analysis regarding certain
 
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.350 align:start position:0%
to provide an analysis regarding certain
entry-level

02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
entry-level
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
professions as well as
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
we did have a part-time physician funded
 
02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:31.589 align:start position:0%
we did have a part-time physician funded
that

02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
we have eliminated and we don't expect
 
02:03:34.159 --> 02:03:35.189 align:start position:0%
we have eliminated and we don't expect
um

02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
that grant work will be completed by
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
sometime in april of this year
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
so um there's no so we will be
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
so um in terms of the expenditure total
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
for division of administration
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we had um fiscal year
 
02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:57.430 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we had um fiscal year
2020

02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
2.2 uh 2 million 216 thousand dollars
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021. 3 million 460 thousand
 
02:04:04.079 --> 02:04:04.870 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021. 3 million 460 thousand
dollars

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's increased to 6 million 436 000.22
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
and 6 million 370 thousand dollars but
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
that again
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
that is um basically putting all of our
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
expenses agency expenses into a division
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
of administration
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
with the exception of class um 10 class
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
50 and i think class
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
60. so we will have
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
um we currently have nine positions in
 
02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
the division of administration and under
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget we
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
will have
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
um 11 positions in
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
the administration we can move on
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
to technical although technical is being
 
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.270 align:start position:0%
to technical although technical is being
eliminated

02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i actually have three pages of xero
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that's due to your reorganization
 
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.189 align:start position:0%
and that's due to your reorganization
right

02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's great excuse me one moment madam
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
chair i have to plug in my computer
 
02:04:53.599 --> 02:04:54.550 align:start position:0%
chair i have to plug in my computer
because

02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
he's about to die should have done this
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
you gotta love technology
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah much rather be in person
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
so we're proposing to eliminate the
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
division of technical professions
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
and then we're proposing um to eliminate
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
the division of health professions
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
and then we are proposing to create um
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
the division of licensing and board
 
02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
the division of licensing and board
administration

02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can continue to streamline
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
all of our licensing functions
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
and you'll see in this division that um
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the only classes that we have
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
are class 10 18 and 50.
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
and so 10 obviously class 10 has to do
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
with our permanent um classified
 
02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
with our permanent um classified
employees

02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that those employees are
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
supported in their crosswalk
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
but primarily our licensing folks and
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
our board administrators
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
um we are not projecting much over time
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
2010 that we are projecting was a
 
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
2010 that we are projecting was a
carryover

02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
carryover
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
from um i believe it was the division of
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
health professions that's what we've
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
historically had
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um allocated to us or appropriated in
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
terms of overtime
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
um often often our inspectors will be
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
called on
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
to to receive overtime because
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
inspections can sometimes last longer
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
than one anticipates
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so we've we've left that in there and
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
our class 50 is obviously significantly
 
02:06:21.679 --> 02:06:22.629 align:start position:0%
our class 50 is obviously significantly
reduced

02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
to 64 000 um and 66 000
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended 22 and 23
 
02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:31.830 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended 22 and 23
budget

02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
we are projecting 40 permanent
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
classified positions
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
as well as class 60 benefits 1.1 million
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and 1.2 million dollars
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
so um then the next division that we're
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
creating or proposing to create is the
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
and again this includes class 10 1850
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
and 60.
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
um and then class 10 we have 1.9 million
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
dollars or almost 2 million dollars and
 
02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 23 2 million 100
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
116 000. we do have more overtime um
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
allocated in this
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
budget again this goes to our inspectors
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
particularly with the
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
addition of the six inspectors for
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
um we don't always use it but sometimes
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
our inspectors have to
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
work overtime with some of the
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
inspections that they're doing and
 
02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:24.870 align:start position:0%
inspections that they're doing and
investigations

02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then again our class 50 is
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced to 68 000
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 22 and uh 71 000 in
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh 23 and then of course our benefits
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we are anticipating 32 um
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
positions and this enforcement unit
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement division under the
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
budget does anybody have any questions
 
02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:55.910 align:start position:0%
budget does anybody have any questions
on

02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
on that how do your boards feel with
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
this reorganization
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
are they in favor i think
 
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
um i i think the majority are at this
 
02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
um i i think the majority are at this
point

02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
um i think that the boards have been um
 
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
um i think that the boards have been um
hesitant

02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
hesitant
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
to be uh accepting initially because
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
we've had so many issues with the agency
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
as you're aware
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and um you know they wanted to make sure
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
that this was actually going to benefit
 
02:08:21.599 --> 02:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
that this was actually going to benefit
them

02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
um but we've started we've certainly
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
been working with them
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
particularly with providing enforcement
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
support and they are
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
um really on board with that in really
 
02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:32.470 align:start position:0%
um really on board with that in really
um

02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
supportive of those directions that they
 
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
haven't previously had that support
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
joe do you have anything that you'd like
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
to add because you have a lot of
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
interaction with the boards as well
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
well i think you captured it well um
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
the you know i think the board's
 
02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.510 align:start position:0%
the you know i think the board's
concerns

02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
are you know that there's an open they
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
call it an
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
overreach if you will um and and we
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
clarify to them that we're not taking
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice from them
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
um but you know people get the two
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
intertwined sometimes
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
so um the boards that you know have
 
02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's what it's around and we quickly
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
come back to them and explain that
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know we're not trying to get into
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
your scope of practice at all
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
but there's no question when you say the
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
majority you know out of the 50
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know plus boards you know you're
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
talking a handful that really
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
have expressed concerns high high 40s
 
02:09:27.119 --> 02:09:27.669 align:start position:0%
have expressed concerns high high 40s
are

02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
completely on board in my opinion
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
so representative leishman has a
 
02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:45.270 align:start position:0%
so representative leishman has a
question

02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
so on one of another one of your
 
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
handouts that i was looking at the
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
crossbar versus the new accounting
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
units yes
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's a line as far as credit card
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
processing fees
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
which shows a fairly steep increase do
 
02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:05.830 align:start position:0%
which shows a fairly steep increase do
you

02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
charge people when they use their credit
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
cards like the secretary of state
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
charges a small fee
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost versus the state
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
having to pay the cost
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question we don't
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
presently charge but we do
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
have a proposed rule um in the works
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we did file an initial proposal so
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
um shift the cost we do have that
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
authority under state law there's a
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
statute that allows us to do that
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
um and that is our proposal that we
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
would charge
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
because of technology it's a little bit
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to do so but our proposal
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
right now is to charge an additional
 
02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
right now is to charge an additional
2.50

02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
2.50
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
to assist with covering the cost of the
 
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
credit card fees
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
but obviously depending on the fee that
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
250 may not be 2.3
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
um and and i don't know where that rule
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
will go
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
um but our goal would be to to try to
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
shift that back on the licensee to some
 
02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:55.589 align:start position:0%
shift that back on the licensee to some
extent

02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
extent
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
so that the state is not paying the cost
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
and one further question
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up chair also on that same page
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh rent to owners of non-state
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
facilities or buildings presently is
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
zero and you're going up
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
to 367 thousand dollars is
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
you couldn't find anything with das
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
no available state space no
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
i we got a call in june um
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
i got a call in june first essentially
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
from um
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
jane millerick saying we needed to move
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
july 1 because hhs needed our building
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
and um there was no state spanx
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
available for an agency of our size and
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
there were four agencies in that
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
building and i think they were able to
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
find state space for
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
others um but not for us okay
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair representative
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
wallace you have a question
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
i do thank you madam chairman um i want
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
to go back to the topic we were
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
discussing before
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative lee simmons questions and
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
at the time dois was created
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
i was hearing concerns from the staff
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
not from the boards but from the staff
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
to the boards that by centralizing this
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
and centralizing the personnel
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
that they would not have the same
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
expertise as each board's personnel
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
individually had so you know the
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
plumbing board they knew plumbing the
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
nursing board they knew nursing whatever
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
and when you have
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
a person handling multiple boards they
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have the same
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
expertise in all those fields
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you're hearing
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
i we're not hearing those concerns at
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
the moment from staff uh
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
what our staff are expressing is that we
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
are not we don't have sufficient number
 
02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:37.910 align:start position:0%
are not we don't have sufficient number
of

02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
individuals to assist and that's one of
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we proposed adding on
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
four additional board administrators i
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
know that historically the staff
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
have um you know when the staff came on
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
board they didn't necessarily come on
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
willingly when the boards came on board
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
they didn't really come in willingly i i
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
um and so i a lot of our staff were
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
really tied into their boards and and
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
that was great but we had to work
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
through some of those issues
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
from our perspective you don't
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to know
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
the profession that's why we rely on the
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
board members but the process should be
 
02:13:13.119 --> 02:13:13.750 align:start position:0%
board members but the process should be
very

02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
similar um certainly it's helpful if you
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
understand medicine but you don't need
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
to be a doctor in order to assist the
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
board of medicine and the same is true
 
02:13:22.079 --> 02:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
board of medicine and the same is true
for

02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
dental examiners and by making the
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
processes the same
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
and efficient we should be able to
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
effectively provide that support to more
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
than one board that said we do need
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
additional support in order to be able
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions do we
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
i have one manager here just a comment
 
02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
i have one manager here just a comment
patch

02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
patch
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam jerry sorry to ask um
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
just as a note lindsay i just want to
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
and and just from my perspective the
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
board has been
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
um the administration of the board has
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
been a concern in the past
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
but i i think there's a lot of
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
improvement that has taken place and i
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
think it comes from the top and i just
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
want to thank you
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you madam chair thank
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
you representative i appreciate that
 
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's like any other situation it
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
takes a while this
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
originally was an idea that governor
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
then governor hassan had that put things
 
02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:27.030 align:start position:0%
then governor hassan had that put things
together

02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i think we're finally seeing the
 
02:14:29.199 --> 02:14:30.149 align:start position:0%
and i think we're finally seeing the
fruition

02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
fruition
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
of some of those synergies that she
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
hoped to see
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
and it just takes a while to get
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
everything to jail and it looks like
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
things are moving along
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes i i will say that the energy in the
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
building from our stack is very positive
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
we've done a complete 180 people are
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
excited about what we're doing
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and we're really excited about being
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
able to move this
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
agency in a positive direction and i
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
really think in five years
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire can be on the cutting edge
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
of occupational licensing
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
and looking at other opportunities and
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
ways that we can you know bring people
 
02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:05.109 align:start position:0%
ways that we can you know bring people
in

02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're adequately
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
protecting the public
 
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
but also thinking outside the box you
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
know looking at veterans and how we
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
how we you know bring bring them into
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
the state and
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
lindsey i really like to thank you
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
because we looked at
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
hb2 in that lengthy
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
situation with oplc you've pulled it
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
together very
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
nicely for us as how hb1 and hb2
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
tie together so i appreciate the time
 
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
you took making that very clear for us
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate you and your staff
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
being with us this morning
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%

turn off our pictures i believe it's
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
what is known as
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
