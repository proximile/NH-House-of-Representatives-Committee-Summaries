Sullivan in between there uh prior to

that I ran for congress in
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
2016 when I was Majority Leader that's
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
why I missed out a term in labor I've
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
always been on the labor committee um
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
the uh background is insurance work as
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
comp I'm pretty heavy on work comp
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
insurance uh but I also was a uh
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard chairman and a uh selectman
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
in my town where I negotiated Union
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
contracts um so I got insurance I've got
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh collective bargaining I've got a
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
little bit of the unemployment situation
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's why they stuck me here
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
for four
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
that actually I was asked to be on
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
another committee but uh the speaker
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
next four
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
weeks uh and get our bills
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
done um and then uh so for example the
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
four bills that we hear today will exec
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
next week in the morning and then we'll
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
hear bills in the in the afternoon and
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
early or later in the morning and then
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
the next week we'll EXA those so um
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative solom I talked about it
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we neither of us like executing
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
bills on that day and so we will not
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
with the exception of tomorrow which is
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
a that's a oneoff with the uh we won't
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
EXA bills that day uh unless the two of
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
us agree that it just is easier to do
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
but other than that we'll will adhere to
 
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.069 align:start position:0%
but other than that we'll will adhere to
that

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
schedule uh emails did is everyone get
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
I've sent out a couple of emails to to
 
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
the committee is everyone getting
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
those look
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
at okay I can't coach
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
that I just want to make sure I got the
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
right emails okay all right
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
um okay so dress and
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
decorum uh
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
typically the dressing form is business
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
attire and everyone in here is is
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
dressed accordingly so we can adhere to
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
that that's fine
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
um food drink in in here okay so cup is
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
all right if we could keep it underneath
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
and off the table that would be great uh
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
technically it's water only but I don't
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
know what's in your cups okay and I'm
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
not going to inspect okay food is really
 
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.549 align:start position:0%
not going to inspect okay food is really
a

00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
nonstarter um and a lot of people use
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
the room and they don't clean it very
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
often so if we could hold to that and I
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
always have my
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
Altoids okay so this is not food this is
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
energy so I I make a clear distinction
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
there um but the idea is this is not a
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
place to eat lunch it's not a place to
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
eat while you're in committee um and so
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
that if we can adhere to that that would
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
be great use of electronic devices okay
 
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's about respect to the person
 
00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.669 align:start position:0%
it's it's about respect to the person
providing

00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um and so you know obviously
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
cell phones off are are down um but in
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
in listening to testimony I like to look
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
and see to double check does that make
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
sense is that right so I don't have a
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
problem if you bring your computer in I
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem if you if you're on
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
your phone but just remember that we're
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
only here to hear what they have to say
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
and so respect to the people that are
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
taking their time to come up and talk to
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
us I think is what we have to adhere to
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
um but clearly if if you've got your
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
laptop or your tablet or your phone that
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's quite all
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
right please
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
um typically um I usually use my iPad
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
for or a device um if we're dealing with
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and they're
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
referencing um particular rsas it's
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
quick to U instead of printing everybody
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
out it's quick for us sometimes to look
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
them up while we're discussing with them
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we were talking about
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
the right points is that okay yeah oh
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely y excuse me to that point are
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
we going to get copies of the LA book as
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
we had previous times do we
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
know I don't I'm not familiar with that
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh you have copies of the bills I know I
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
was just curious
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
Chang we used to get a copy of the lsrs
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
of the lsrs or the bill I me not the LS
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
I mean the labor bills oh yeah you got
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
them in your packet Y no no no mean the
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
statutes the rsas statute right we used
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
to get the book from the labor okay I oh
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I've seen that no no I know what
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about but I'm not
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with that being in the
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
committee and outside I think they're
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
right here yeah no we used to get a do
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
you recall shortened yeah years ago I
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
we if if you want one
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
then I think it then get Davis can get
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
it for you okay but I I don't I don't
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
need one um and so if you want one if
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
anyone wants one ask Davis and I'm sure
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
he can get that for you
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh okay committee drawers on the
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
other side of those lights right there
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
are committee drawers all of your names
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
are on those the keys are inside so if
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
you want to keep whatever you want to
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
keep in there
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure it's
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
secure uh and then um you can use that I
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
I don't tend to use it but they're there
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
if you need it I'm sorry sir and can you
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
awesome well welcome thank
 
00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:21.070 align:start position:0%
awesome well welcome thank
you

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
um okay so emergency procedures I don't
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate any emergencies but uh uh
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative labry is our sort of
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
Sergeant arms and he's got code words if
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
something happens he knows what to do if
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
there's a fire our fire exit is
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
literally right there so you go out here
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
make a left and go down the stairs um so
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully that doesn't happen um but
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the
 
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.909 align:start position:0%
that's that's the
procedures

00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
um okay so I did 30 years in the Army
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
and what they taught you is when you
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
when you start off
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
an operation you read the mission so if
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
you can bear with me I'm just going to
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
read our mission and that way it it puts
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
it in record okay so it shall be the
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
duty of the committee on labor
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
industrial and rehabilitative service to
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
consider all matters relating to labor
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
wages and workers compensation including
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation and incentiv
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
incentive programs collective bargaining
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
and binding arbitration matters relating
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
to job retaining and employ
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services and other
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
matters relating to balancing the rights
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
of employees to the needs of the
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
industrial sector and such other matters
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
as referred to um so that's what we're
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
here for and I'm really looking forward
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
to getting after that and understanding
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
the details and second and third order
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
consequences and the details of the
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that comes before
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
us uh partisan balance um
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're at a 9 and 11 uh the one thing is
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
on exec sessions it's a 24-hour
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
notification and so we can get a
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
replacement to vote only uh as directed
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
by the party
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
chair uh but we need 24 hours notice and
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
so please adhere to that um especially
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
if we have critical legislation where
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to be along a party
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
we are looking at our early bills that I
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
know of next week those are all the
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
financial ones and so we're going to
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
knock that out next week and we'll be
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
well ahead of well ahead of schedule I
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
didn't see any others on there that were
 
00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:45.710 align:start position:0%
didn't see any others on there that were
second

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
committee so I think I think we're good
 
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.110 align:start position:0%
committee so I think I think we're good
on

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.149 align:start position:0%
on
that

00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
BS no that's great thank you no that's
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
perfect um so subcommittees as as I
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
understand we have no standing
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittees okay subcommittee is an
 
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
instance where um something needs a
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
little bit more work
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
or something needs some more specific
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
research and we do that in
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
committee without passing a bill to send
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
that to the speaker and we just
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
got talked to again there are there are
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
over 200 commissions and committees
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
300 okay he used 200 this morning it
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
could be 300 I don't know it's a boat
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
ton okay each one of those requires
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the bill says three five
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
representatives to fill that commission
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
and when you multiply that by two or 300
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
it's a ton of people and so uh what I
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
found to be very successful in my last
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
two committees was the use of a
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we may consider the use
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh that is wholly within
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
the purview of this committee and then
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
that way if there's a subject that comes
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
up that um we need a little bit more
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
detail refinement to we just take that
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
on ourselves rather than pushing it back
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
on the rest of the house and that's just
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
for consideration and we can do that if
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
if that's what we determine is a better
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
way to do
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
it um so in terms of
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
of committee duties really in my mind as
 
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
a as a chair as a vice chair as the
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
clerk you have specific duties and and
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
we know what those are but our duties as
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives is to listen and hear
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
what people are saying it is to ask
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
questions that are pertinent to what
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
that person's expertise is that provide
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
value to our decision making and so um
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
be here be
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
present uh engage with the people
 
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.269 align:start position:0%
present uh engage with the people
providing

00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
providing
testimony

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
um specifically
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
as a member you're not giving a speech
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
you're not engaging in a debate you're
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
not this is not a court of law so
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
there's no one there's no Perry masons
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
in here but it is about trying to
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
understand the issues and the second and
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
third order effects of of whatever
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is out there um so it's
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
really it's an exciting opportunity uh
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
that we have as committee members
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
and that anything else from anyone on
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a great Point uh and we'll
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
just we'll jump to that here real quick
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
so um typically in executive session uh
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative San I will talk
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
beforehand to sort of get a feel for you
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
know how things are going but uh it's
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's always good to understand who's
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
going to make the motion On Any Given
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
Bill and we'll decide that beforehand
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
and so when we go into executive session
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
understanding who's going to provide
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
that motion the person that provides
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
that motion
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh is responsible for the committee
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
report the
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
blurb and uh if there's a if there is a
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
minority um opinion as well then uh
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
either myself or representative Solon
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
will determine who uh writes that
 
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.430 align:start position:0%
will determine who uh writes that
Minority

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
Minority
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
position um you in the house calendar
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
you'll often times
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
see uh blurbs committee reports that are
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
a page long
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
um to me that's interesting but it's not
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
compelling um and
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
so um typically it's about understanding
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
the what the Crux of the matter is
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
expressing that efficiently and then uh
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that everyone understands
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
why either you agree or disagree with uh
 
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:22.519 align:start position:0%
what the committee has recommended and
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
so that is a great opportunity to engage
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
with house leadership to have an
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on the floor and um
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know we'll we'll figure out who does
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
that as we go through in terms of how
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
the executive sessions go are there
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
questions to that any comments anything
 
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.750 align:start position:0%
questions to that any comments anything
I

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.509 align:start position:0%
I
missed

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
missed
 
00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
missed
okay

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
um so on decorum you know quite honestly
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh just treat people with respect and
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
dignity that that's what this is um the
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
assumption is that the person that's
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
providing testimony is uh is giving you
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
their best guess what they know and
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're not trying to be evasive or or
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh deception or deceitful um and so just
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
treat people with resp respect and
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
identity it's the same with us we're all
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
elected officials we're all uh adults
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
and uh so um just treat each other as
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
you would expect to be Tre treated and I
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
think I think we'll be
 
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.629 align:start position:0%
think I think we'll be
fine

00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman um I know
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
that through the years that I've been
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
here um 90 to 95% of what we discuss is
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
non-political and we've always left the
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
poit politics at the door that's been
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
the way it's been uh for years um
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
obviously there's going to be some bills
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
that both sides are passionate on um
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
that's the only time that I've seen
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
partisan Antics in this room so I just
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
want to say uh and thank everybody for
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
that I I agree completely uh tomorrow um
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
the last bill that we hear I'm actually
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
introducing and so as the one
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill I am not allowed to
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
sit on the uh in the committee uh so
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
Deputy will take over for for that bill
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
if you have a bill that's being
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
introduced to committee um you and you
 
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.350 align:start position:0%
introduced to committee um you and you
uh

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
and you're the one that that uh enters
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
that bill into testimony then uh you
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
cannot sit on the committee you can vote
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
during executive session but you cannot
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
question okay that's just that's the
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
house rules and it's pretty
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward um on Executive
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
session uh we and we'll have our first
 
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.230 align:start position:0%
session uh we and we'll have our first
one

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
tomorrow essentially it has to be on the
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
on the house calendar so if you look at
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
our calendars I've got a standard blurb
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
in there that says we may exec bills uh
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
again as I said
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
initially the intention is and without
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
agreement from both sides we will not
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
accept bills that that aren't on the
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
calendar okay
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um but essentially the a motion is made
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and then when discussion is
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
done uh and then we vote and and we go
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
from there um in terms of committee
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
meeting you
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
know you don't have to ask every
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
question so you are more than welcome to
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
ask questions and I'm not going to keep
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
you from asking questions but we all
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
sort of hold each other accountable if
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
the same question's been asked 54 times
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
and I've seen this then someone else
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
asked the same question wait you just
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
asked that question so in my hand I
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
don't say that but in my hand i'm come
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
on now you know let's be courteous to
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
each other
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and so if it's a gerain question if
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
you if you're compelled to ask it by all
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
means but if you're not compelled to do
 
00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
it and it doesn't provide value then
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
consider not asking the question and I'm
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
just trying
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's more efficient than
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
asking the same questions
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
or questions that don't don't
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
matter uh anything else on Executive
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
sessions that people want to bring up
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
we'll I'm sure we'll learn how to do it
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
straightforward we talked about absences
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
email talked about dress food coffee
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
these are just the details of things we
 
00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:55.109 align:start position:0%
these are just the details of things we
talked

00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so today we have um the
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
11: and then
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
um we have the employment security uh
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
folks coming in and they're they're just
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
provide uh an example of what kind of
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
testimony we expect how what are the
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
critical issues from their perspective
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
and how do we engage with them okay so
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's later on
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
today uh here's um Davis Allen's phone
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
number right here representative Granger
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
page one thing that that comes up
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
occasionally is that people will want to
 
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.790 align:start position:0%
occasionally is that people will want to
wear

00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
um political t-shirts or something like
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
that and that's just a non-starter we we
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.349 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes so all questions go through the
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
chair and so it's not your own personal
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
dialogue with the person providing
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
testimony if you ask a question and you
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
want a followup then ask permission for
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
a followup I I will almost always
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee you that you'll get that
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
permission but it adds just that's the
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
process in committee we'll address
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
ourselves by
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative um and and that just
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
keeps that sort of level of
 
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.030 align:start position:0%
keeps that sort of level of
formality

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
formality
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of people will email us
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
their testimony that's great um but the
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
clerk will collect the testimony and I
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
will ask anyone providing testimony to
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
give written copies to everyone and uh
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
you can do what you want with those um a
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
lot of times it does help to read their
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
testimony beforehand so you can sort of
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
frame your question repres I have a
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
question about the email system here
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
I've been out for a couple years is it
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
still the case where the whole committee
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
has one email address like house flavor
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
at whatever and it goes to all us
 
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
automatically is that still a thing yeah
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
you can get to that and I have gotten to
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
it if you ask me today to get it for you
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
I might be able to find it if it's still
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
out there and Jamie knows how to do that
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
okay the other thing is the email that
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
I've sent to all of you has all 20 of us
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
on it sure individually you it has all
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
of us on individually you could reply
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
all and change the subject yeah or copy
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
and paste it but did it is on the nh.gov
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere somewhere thanks I've done it
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
before but representative
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr Mr chair so if if
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking for the shorthand version
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
of emailing everyone on the committee if
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
you log into Outlook and search for the
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
commit or and start typing it'll show up
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
and then if you need the individual
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
emails click the little puss button next
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
to it and it'll expand it but within the
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
Outlook within our system we just start
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
typing House labor labor it'll autop
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
populate y I've done that in the past
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
there you go thanks thank
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
you I knew the young guys the
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
Millennials would know the answer of
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
that um and so voting uh is is pretty
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward I'll ask the the clerk
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
to conduct a uh a roll call and it's a
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
roll call vote it'll be the same order
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
every time you know straight straight
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
off of the uh straight off the committee
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.349 align:start position:0%
 
last

00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
um for those of you oh so here's another
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
thing that that I've done in my last two
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
committees I don't know that it's
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
necessary in this one but is field trips
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
so if there's something that we're
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
stumbling on that we think that a
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge would be a better
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
way to understand it let me know I'm
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
completely open to doing it uh I've done
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
it to on Ena we went to um the landfills
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
which is a huge bill a lot of a lot of
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
issues and that was very helpful and
 
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.430 align:start position:0%
issues and that was very helpful and
then

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.349 align:start position:0%
then
yes

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.280 align:start position:0%

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester sorry I'm late no welcome to
 
00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
the committee thank
 
00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
you okay any any aliis anything that we
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about that we need to talk
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
about burning questions not so burning
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions anything that I missed from
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
folks that have been here for a while
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
sir uh Mr chairman we have uh assigned
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
to us a staff person yes um so it's
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
always been unclear to me um
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
what what we can ask of them uh how we
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
ask I know we have to go through the
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
chair to ask questions but there are
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
many times when they probably could put
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
their hands on things that quicker than
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
we could given the the resources that
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
they have available to them so yeah it's
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
an it's a a resource for the committee
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
but my experience has been we haven't
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
really as a committee person really used

room setup and she does sort of the
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
admin activities she'll she turns in the

has six different committees that she
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%

last year and the votes for the last
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%

want to overwhelm him if all 20 of us go
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
to him then that can be problematic um
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
but you feel free if you have questions
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%

00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
like that he's he's anxious to
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
help thank you and I let me just also
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
mention that uh for those who are people
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
who are interested in the history of
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislation many times we get the same
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
bill com in here uh I I've been over to
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
the archives and much of that I think is
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
really underutilized the archives yeah
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
but if you ever want to know the history
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
of of legislation or why something ended
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
up in in the bill you can actually uh go
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
on the archives now a lot of it has been
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
digitized and you can look at all the
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
testimony for all the
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and it's been it's really
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
help ful especially when you're looking
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
to determine you know what the intent
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
was of of the legislation so all of the
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
notes are in there and all the
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
testimonies is in there and it's a it's
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
a very easy thing to use and you can get
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
to it by way of the uh the State website
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
so I would those haven't used it I would
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it and which reminds
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
me so the reason that we use the
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
microphone especially in a small room
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
like this is that our our hearings are
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
all recorded and so they are are
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
archived and in fact uh you can look at
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
last year's hearings now I mean you know
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
through the through the NH
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
um uh General Court website um and so
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
when when you do talk use your
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
microphones because that's this speaker
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
goes straight into the video um audio
 
00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
recording and uh so a lot of times uh
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know at over across the street
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
they'll be watching the
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
testimony um and anyone any citizen can
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
watch the testimony and so that that's
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
the way that we make sure the audio is
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
is available to them is through the
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
microphones okay what else any other
 
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.470 align:start position:0%
microphones okay what else any other
questions

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
comments so let's take a 19 minute break
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
be back here at 11: and ready for the
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
the labor department to give their
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:25.950 align:start position:0%

the technology so I'm glad I was able to
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
get that started good morning I'm
 
01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert I am the Deputy
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioner at the Department of Labor
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
very happy to be here today I'm here
 
01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
with our general counsel Attorney John
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
garrian um we appreciate you having us
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
in and my understanding is maybe uh for
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
some of you a little bit of an overview
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
about what the Department of Labor does
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
um could be of some benefit um as well
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
as maybe some information or overview
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
about how we are available to assist um
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
the the committee and then any questions
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
that you may have um so just kind of
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
globally you know the Department of
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
Labor what is it what does it do uh you
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
know the Department of Labor is
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
primarily involved in the reg um in in
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
sort of four regulatory areas the two
 
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
largest ones I would say being the
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
regulation of what we call uh wage and
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
hour law it's a sector of labor law that
 
01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
pertains to you know payment of wages
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
oversight of minimum wage payment to
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
employees how they're paid um youth
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
labor the employment of youth um hours
 
01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
that youth work um those types of areas
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include unemployment
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
insurance that's a different agency uh
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
and I highlight that because there are
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
times I think when the um when New
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security who
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
oversees unemployment related issues is
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
confused with the Department of Labor um
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
so we don't handle any unemployment
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
insurance related issues but if an
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
employee is uh you know working for an
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
employer and there are issues related to
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
how that person's paid they're not
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
getting paid for all hours work the
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
means or modality of payment um that's
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
something that the Department of Labor
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
may get involved with uh and has some
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
oversight of um in addition the other
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
primary area that we're involved with
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
and I would say it's probably the
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
largest portion of what the department
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
um is involved with is regulation of the
 
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
workers compensation system for the
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um so it is not
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
regulation of how policies are put
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
together that's the department of
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
insurance but employers are required to
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
secure and maintain workers compensation
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage to cover their
 
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
employees which is something that the
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor uh compliance wise
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
assures employers are doing and then if
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
there are disputes or issues related to
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
the payment of workers compensation
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
benefits to Injured Workers that's
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
something that the department of labor
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
would be directly involved in regulating
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
assisting with Andor overseeing uh so
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
oversight of the workers compensation
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
system is a large portion of what we do
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
um other things that the department is
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
involved with um the oversight and
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
regulation of uh Public Employee safety
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
so public employers your T the state
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
towns municipalities uh safety
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
regulations and safety requirements that
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
pertain to those employees is something
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Labor is employ
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh involved with uh and then also
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough the oversight and
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
regulation of boiler and elevator
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
certification uh so when you go you know
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
even in this building if you go into the
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
elevator you'll see the certificate
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's certifying your elevator to
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
operate that's something that's overseen
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
and actually issued by the Department of
 
01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
Labor and we do it for again both uh
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
boilers and air tanks and pressure
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
vessels uh and all of the elevators in
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
the state um so in addition to
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
regulating those areas um I think it's
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
good to be aware the department has a
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
hearings Bureau so you know certain
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
types of disputes that may come forward
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
and primarily in the context of
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
employees who are asserting that their
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
owed wages uh from an employer they can
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
bring a claim through the department and
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
have an administrative hearing to get a
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
a determination or or resolution to that
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
claim we have a hearings Bureau with uh
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
hearings adjudicators who handle those
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
cases and render those decisions and
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
then disputed workers compensation cases
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
if a injured worker is having a dispute
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
with an insurance carrier about whether
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
or not a a injury is a compensable one
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
or the payment of certain benefits
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
attendant to or associated with a
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
compensable claim can be brought to the
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor through the hearings
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau where a a neutral adjudicator
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
separate from the regulatory divisions
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
is going to hear the case taken evidence
 
01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
and then render a decision and then
 
01:08:59.309 --> 01:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
there are appeal rights to either
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
various boards or to uh Superior Court
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
if for any party who is AG grieved by
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
any outcome that comes from our hearings
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
um from our hearings Bureau um that's a
 
01:09:12.269 --> 01:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
little bit about what we do um quick in
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
a nutshell are there any questions that
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
I can take about what we're involved
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
with or uh anything about what we do at
 
01:09:18.239 --> 01:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
with or uh anything about what we do at
the

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
department represent McKenzie you have a
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you good
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
um you um uh also helped uh Injured
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
Workers through a process internally
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
that was actually built into the law the
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
omnius yes person so can you talk a
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
little bit about the role of uh so that
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
people can come to the department they
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
can do prosay if they want to and there
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
was actually somebody to help them
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
within the department yeah absolutely so
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
the um provision that you're talking
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
about is a portion of our workers
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
compensation statute I want to say it's
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
at 281a 42c don't quote me on that um
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
what that section of the workers
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
compensation statute does is it
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
establishes a pray dispute resolution
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
coordinator which is a specific position
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh that by law is assigned to work with
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
unrepresented Injured Workers to assist
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
them in both understanding and then
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
navigating their rights within the
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
workers compensation system um so you
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
know that person is not an attorney and
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
the law is very clear clear the position
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
does not give legal advice and the
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
position cannot attend disputed hearings
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
with an injured worker but providing
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
information about the hearing process um
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
providing information about benefits or
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
how they work or what the you know
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
statute says about time frames related
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
to those benefits um sometimes this
 
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
position um which is currently filled at
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
the department uh sometimes helps
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
connect insurance carriers and Injured
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
Workers um we find um that there is a
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
fair amount of times when there are what
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
we call mised connections an injured
 
01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
worker for whatever reason is having
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting a hold of their
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
adjuster they keep missing each other
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
they simply need to be connected to
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
resolve um either a bill or or uh
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
Indemnity payment cash payments that are
 
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
related to the claim trying to
 
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
facilitate those Communications to
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
resolve those types of issues before
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
they brew into disputes that may
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately end up going to a hearing um
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
so we do have a full-time position at
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
the department dedicated to working with
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
those individuals it's a resource that's
 
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
available to any unrepresented injured
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
worker certainly if the injured worker
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
um has an attorney and they have a right
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
to secure one if they like they're not
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
required to um and and we have plenty of
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
unrepresented Injured Workers who are
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
able to navigate the system including
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing process independently but
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
that position is uh solely dedicated to
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
working with those individuals to help
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
them really understand how workers
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
compensation works and and uh how how to
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
system and representative flon thank you
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it's good to see you again good
 
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
to see you as well um the question that
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie proposed uh
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
became became law when the ability to
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
have an utsman if I could use that term
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
was it a few years ago no it's been in
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
the statute for some time although I
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
will admit I don't know exactly when the
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
provision went off the top of my head
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
into statute because I I always and when
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
former chairman infantine was there we
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
we and I discussed a number of times
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
about you know it's so hard to navigate
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
things when it's an issue about you know
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment or in this case you know
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers workers comper related
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
things and so how you don't know exactly
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
how long but it's been around for a
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
little while huh it it's the it's been
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
in statute for for some time and forgive
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
me because I don't know off the top of
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
my head when that particular provision
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
went into effect I will say that the
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
department um did take a look at the uh
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement and at the way we
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
had the role configured several years
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
ago maybe three four years ago now uh if
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm my memory serves correctly
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
and we did refine how we were providing
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
that service in the sense that we had
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
several people previously providing the
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
same type of service but also handling
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
other areas within the system um and we
 
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
determined and then implemented that it
 
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
would be best to have a sole person
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated to only serving as that
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator so for the past three or
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
four years it's been that a singular
 
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
staff person providing that particular
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
service to Injured Workers um
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
alone please thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
that that position is probably very
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
unique and applicable for smaller claims
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
like a couple thousand dollars wor of
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
medical bills or something like that
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
because a a lawyer may not want to get
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
involved when it's a couple thousand
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
dollars because I think it's is it still
 
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
capped at a 20% fee or something
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees dependent on what stage
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the process you're in it's a little
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
different if you're at the appeals level
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
but attorney fees for Indemnity is going
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
to be at 20% if there's a medical bill
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
dispute dependent upon prevailing then
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier May pay is St
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
limitation on claims to bring a claim
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
forward you have 18 months from the date
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
of a denial to assert the claim how
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
about from the date of the injury from
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
the date of the injury I believe they uh
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers have three years in
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
which to bring the claim forward my
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
apologies I should have asked for a
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
followup thank you sir and
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative sto thank you Mr chair um
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
I have a question about um about um data
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
regarding wages in the state on you know
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh the elmi gives average wages for
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
different types of employment but I'm
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
wondering if it's possible to get data
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
for how many people there are at each
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
wage level and what types of jobs
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing so for example the
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
question that we often get is how many
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
people are actually making minimum wage
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
or 725 an hour we know that there are
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
about a thousand people in the state um
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
is it possible to find out what they're
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
doing for work or is it because it's
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
such a small number it wouldn't be you
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
know it it would be specified it's an
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
excellent question uh and it's probably
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
one that would be better answered
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire employment
 
01:15:13.229 --> 01:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
security so wage reporting um and
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
Reporting you know how many employees
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
you're paying and and information
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
Associated to those payments uh I
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
believe goes over to Employment Security
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the context of their regulation of
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
the unemployment insurance um Provisions
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Labor will engage
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
with employees and employers and in the
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
course of performing an audit of or
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
inspecting an employer may look at
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
payroll records and ascertain or
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
determine somebody who should be making
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
minimum wage has not been and then we
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
may um you know ask that wages be
 
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted by that employer to make that
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
employee whole but as far as employers
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
reporting that type of information to
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor we do not
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
receive that type of information I
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
believe it would be Employment Security
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
though you're welcome
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative K thank you Mr
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Deputy would you like to
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
touch on the Inspection Division I'm
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
sorry would you like to touch on the
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division sure yes absolutely
 
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
so um our two primary divisions our
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
biggest divisions Our Workers
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
Compensation Division and then what we
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
also call the Inspection Division um
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes called wage and hour division
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh but inspections encompasses a little
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
bit more than just wage and hour so um
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
as it relates to sort of wage and hour
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
types of cases um we have a team of
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
inspectors overseen by a division
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
administrator who will go out and
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
normally upon receiving complaints when
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
employee is not bared or precluded from
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
contacting the department and asserting
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm working for an employer that
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
employer hasn't paid me or they're
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
taking deductions out of my paycheck or
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
asserting some you know some sort of
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
complaint that they may have the
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
complaint is vetted and if if you know
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
once vetted the Inspection Division may
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
go out and engage with the employer the
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
course of a labor inspection in looking
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
at uh or to determine whether or not the
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
wage and hour labor laws are being
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
complied with uh and that typically
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
involves speaking with the employer um
 
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
there are employee interviews that can
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
happen those are confidential by Statute
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
um as well as looking at payroll records
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
or other types of records that the
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
employer maintains uh and then if there
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
are determinations or findings that
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
there have been violations of certain
 
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
labor laws some violations by a statute
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
are subject to a warning and if a
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
warning is given um the employer has 30
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
days to mitigate and correct and it
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
stays as a warning um some violations
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
primarily ones related to non-payment of
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
wages are not subject to a warning um if
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
a violation is cited then there is a uh
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
there may be a civil penalty or is a
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
civil penalty that can be at issue at
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
the conclusion of a of a labor
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
inspection um the labor inspector does
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
author a report that report will outline
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
what you know what their findings were
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
what the determination are um and then
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's a sit down meeting with the
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
employer where the report is given it is
 
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
discussed and the employer has uh the
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
option if penalties are at issue as the
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
result of one of those inspections has
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
the option to sit down and engage with
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
the Inspection Division director um to
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know sort through whether or not
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's something that can be resolved uh
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
or or um settled we call it an informal
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
process um so typically what the
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
department is looking for through that
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
processes has the employer adjusted some
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
of their practices or corrected
 
01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
violations that they found and if so if
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
penalties are at issue they may be
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
reduced um reduced Down based on on
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
those types of um demonstrations thank
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
you very much you're
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
San thank you Mr chairman um could you
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
touch on one of my favorite topics um
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
public sector worker safety and the role
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
the department plays in that yes um so
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
as I had uh noted a moment ago the
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
inspection division is not just limited
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
to wage and hour inspections uh we also
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
have within that division what we call
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
our safety uh inspection unit or area um
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the department through RSA 277 and
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of the workers
 
01:19:09.629 --> 01:19:09.639 align:start position:0%
compensation statute um oversees and
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
regulates uh primarily public employer
 
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
safety so as it relates to public
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
employer safety there is a you know a
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
statute that sets forth certain safety
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
requirements that apply to public
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
employees certain requirements that
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
employers are required to uh put into
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
place to assure that their employees are
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
safe um it it's OSHA regulates uh
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
through the federal government regulates
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
the private sector uh in New Hampshire
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
OSHA does not regulate your towns your
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities the state the the public
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
sector so that's left to the Department
 
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
of Labor um so through the statutes and
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
through the Department's regulations uh
 
01:19:49.149 --> 01:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
we will go out and we will engage and en
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
assure that you know public employers um
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
are providing you know adequate safety
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
for their employ emplo es that is also
 
01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
done through the course of an inspection
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
where a safety inspector goes out
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
engages with the public employer and is
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
performing like a workplace um audit uh
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
or or inspection of of the workplace and
 
01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
employee safety and in addition to that
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
there are certain requirements set forth
 
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
through the workers compensation statute
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
that apply to all employers public and
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
private specifically related to filing
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
um safety summary forms and having joint
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
Loss Management committees in place uh
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
those are um requirements that as part
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the workers compensation statute are
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to assure that there are safe
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
workplaces mitigate the amount of
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
injuries that are happening um and our
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors will also go out and
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
engage with all employers uh to assure
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
that if required to have those have a
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
jlmc and safety summary forms on file
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
that those pieces have been attended
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
to you're
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
questions so I do have I do have a
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
question sure um regarding your
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and how do you interact with
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
the committee and what's the best way to
 
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
interact with the
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee um so the department if I
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
understand the question correctly um
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
you're asking about when the department
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
comes to public hearings and how do we
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
best engage so um we do Monitor and
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
follow legislation so I'll I'll start
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
with saying that certainly we are a
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
resource um you know I take a lot of
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
Pride I believe commissioner Maryfield
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
who's the commissioner of Labor takes a
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
lot of pride um in that we are a
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
resource not only for employers
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
employees insurance carriers um but for
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
you as well so when questions come up um
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
we are happy to answer them as it
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
relates to uh public hearings uh you
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
know we primarily are going to be um
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
offering technical guidance so if we
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
have reviewed leg um proposed
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and we have some technical
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
guidance to provide some maybe
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
conflicting with another area of Statute
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
that we think it's important to be aware
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
of um or um something that we might not
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
be able to administer we would want to
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
make certain that you're aware of that
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
that if we see complications or problems
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
in administering it for some reason that
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
we've shared that uh you know we don't
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
view our role as as um policy it's not
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's not what we're involved with so
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
giving policy guidance is not how we
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
conceptualize our role but providing
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
that tech technical guidance about
 
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not the proposed requirements
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh can be implemented regulated or work
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
with existing law um is how is how we
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
will approach um uh coming to public
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
hearings certainly any questions you
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
have we will do the best of our
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
abilities to answer we may not know on
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
the spot off the top of our heads uh you
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
know the exact answer but we will always
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
follow up uh if it's something that you
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
do need to know and again if questions
 
01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:41.639 align:start position:0%
come up ahead of public hearings we're
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
always happy uh to engage in or answer
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
what we
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
can and the one thing you didn't mention
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
that it's not necessarily the purview of
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
this committee as this is a policy
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
committee but also the financial impact
 
01:22:59.310 --> 01:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh going forward in terms of any
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that's going to have a
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
financial impact do you do you provide
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
that information as well yes we do um we
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
will provide it one when asked when
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes are provided to us if we've
 
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
assessed that there's a financial impact
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
we'll provide that information that way
 
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
as well as uh raise it during public
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um if there's not a a
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
financial impact um we're happy to share
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
or answer questions about whether or not
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
there's a concern about financial impact
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
but yes our Our Testimony
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
could include uh whether or not there's
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
a financial impact to any proposed
 
01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.350 align:start position:0%
a financial impact to any proposed
legislation

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
okay um and so do you find normally that
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
you at the end of your your testimony
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
you you're neutral or do you actually
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
come out in favor or oppose to given
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
bills I've seen different departments do
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
it different ways that's why I asked the
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
question yeah no it's an excellent
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
question um and thank you for asking it
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
by by and large the department is
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
neutral on bills again we conceptualize
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
our Ro role is providing the technical
 
01:23:58.830 --> 01:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
guidance uh you know can we implement

distributed around and I'll leave for
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%

01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
version of 282a and all of the relevant
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%

that's impacting the unemployment
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
program the statute and the rules are
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
all right here for folks so um you can
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh grab yourself a copy of that those
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
are the heavy ones to bring back to my
 
01:28:53.109 --> 01:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
car um I also brought a copy of what
 
01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.030 align:start position:0%
car um I also brought a copy of what
individuals

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
that are newly filing for unemployment
 
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
when they come in for their mandated
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
session to get the dos and don'ts for
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
utilizing the unemployment program this
 
01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
is what they receive when they come in
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
for their one-hour session with our
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
staff in the New Hampshire Works offices
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um so I thought
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
it'd be helpful uh for members to see
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
that um the pamphlet with the word
 
01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
scramble on the front is a description
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
of all of our programs both the
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment program but also all of the
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh Reemployment programs that we have
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
for both individuals and for
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
employers and then the uh thinnest
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
handout um was is just a uh uh some
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
information that I present to employers
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
when I go out to talk to them about
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
programs that we have to help with
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention so um I also
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%

to find me and know know where I am at
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
all times it seems so uh for those who
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
won't be a problem um but just quick
 
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
overview of the department and then more
 
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
than happy to answer any and all
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions that members might have so
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
Employment Security is made up of three
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
bureaus um the first Bureau the
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment compens Bureau the one that
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
is uh the most um uh popular uh for uh a
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
topic to be addressed in this committee
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
um that is um with the Department's
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to administer the
 
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
Unemployment Compensation Program for
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
the state so we uh collect taxes and
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
wage reports from employers those taxes
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
that are paid by employers go into the
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
state's trust fund that is managed by
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
empy Employment Security and uh the only
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh payments that are going into there
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
are from New Hampshire employers and
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
then the only reason to take dollars out
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
of that trust fund is to pay
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits to eligible
 
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
individuals we um um we receive those
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
applications for benefits we determine
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
eligibility and um as unemployment is a
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
week toe eligibility based program we
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
then um receive the those weekly
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
applications determined weekly
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility um and provide those
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
payments to what uh the weekly benefit
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
amount that the individual qualifies for
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
so that is our largest program that we
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
administer uh we have two other bureaus
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
we have the Reemployment Services Bureau
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
so that is U the public uh front-facing
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
offices that um folks have either in or
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
very close to their districts we have 12
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Works offices we manage
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
all of those offices um and they are
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
located throughout the state to try to
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
Pro provide as much convenience to not
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
only the claim filing public for people
 
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
utilizing the unemployment program but
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
also for employ employers to utilize for
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
recruitment um and uh for individuals
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
who don't need to be filing for
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment but are searching for a new
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
job or a better job they can utilize the
 
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
resources that we have available in
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
those offices um and we administer a
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
whole assortment of training programs
 
01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
out of those locations as well um our
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
third Bureau is the uh labor market and
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
information Bureau so those are the the
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh State's team of economists and labor
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
market analysts who work hand inand with
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
and they are responsible for publishing
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
and disseminating labor market
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
information uh the most uh um uh common
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
that folks are familiar with would be
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
the monthly unemployment rate in the
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
labor force uh but they are also
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
publishing um U all sorts of materials
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
throughout the year dealing with
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
occupational projections uh industry
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
projections uh industry demand and
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
occupational demand so a lot that they
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh review and analyze and publish
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the year so all three of
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
those bureaus are all housed within

correct correct correct uh we're lowest
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast at
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
22% uh Federal unemployment's at 4.1% so
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
lowest in the Northeast and or second
 
01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
lowest in the Northeast Vermont is
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
usually about a tenth per lower uh but
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
we're about third to Fourth lowest in
 
01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:12.470 align:start position:0%
we're about third to Fourth lowest in
the

01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
country follow up Mr

chairman yes sir
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
um how do I say
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
this our employers
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
like starve for for new employees and
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
other is there like a glut of jobs still
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
out there in New Hampshire that
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
employers are trying to fill uh demand
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
is still elevated not quite as elevated
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
as we saw um initially coming out of the
 
01:34:43.709 --> 01:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic okay uh but we do a um we
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
publish it every other month uh but it's
 
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
a job demand report where we actually um
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
we subscribe to a service that um uh
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
Combs through all of the job postings
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire based employment um or
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
people looking for um individuals in New
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for employment um and we
 
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
break those down by industry by
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
occupation we look at what employers are
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
posting uh we look at what skills
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're identifying and the number of
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
postings is higher right now than it was
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to give you that pre-pandemic
 
01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to give you that pre-pandemic
comparison

01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh but not quite as elevated as it had
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
been um the most current data from the
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
labor market Bureau when we were um
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking with house Ways and Means
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
last week and um New Hampshire is at
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
full employment right now um when you
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
look at U uh I think uh director gotab
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
Brian golab's our director of our labor
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
market information Bureau his favorite
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh measuring stick for whether a
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
state is at full employment is the
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
employment population ratio so that
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
measure that looks at individuals that
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
are 25 to 54 years old Prime working
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
years and anytime New Hampshire is at
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
85% of individuals in that group working
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
um historically he considers that to be
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
full employment New Hampshire is just
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
above that right now um between I think
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
85.4% so tight labor market
 
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
um we've seen about an increase when we
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
look at private sector jobs in the state
 
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
we have about 25,000 more private sector
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
jobs now than we did prior to the
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic so we've seen overall Topline
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
growth of close to 5% but it has not
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
been anywhere um close to being evenly
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
distributed across all of your sectors
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
and employer types so we continue to see
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
strong growth uh within the professional
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
technical scientific indust indry so um
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on there it's a
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
pretty diverse um employment sector we
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
need workers so we need workers there
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
healthc care is where uh you know we we
 
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
see a lot of growth in professional
 
01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
Technical and scientific um where we
 
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
haven't seen as much growth is in the
 
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
health care side particularly hospitals
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
long-term care um a lot of the
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
occupational demand is registered nurses
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
lnas LPNs um so still probably the
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
highest demand occupation is nursing
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
just so happens that that registered
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
nurses are your largest occupation in
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare so that's where most of your
 
01:37:31.390 --> 01:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
now represa kill thank you Mr chair and
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr labers for taking my
 
01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
question uh can you tell me how many New
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
work you must have been spying on me
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
before right before I came over um so
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
the most recent commuter data that we
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
have so New Hampshire has about 130,000
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
residents that commute out of the state
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh to work about 100,000 of them leave
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um however we also have
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
about 880,000 people that commute into
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire every day to work so
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's a net loss of about 50,000 uh we
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
Lo that the loss is with Massachusetts
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
so Massachusetts you get the 100,000 New
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that leave to work
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
in Mass Metts mostly in the the Southern
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
Tier counties and then we have about
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
60,000 that come in from Massachusetts
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
to work in New Hampshire um we are uh
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
net positive with regard to Maine and
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
Vermont so there are more residents of
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont that commute into New
 
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to work uh compared to New
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that commute out to
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
work in either Maine or Vermont but
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
about 130,000 New Hampshire residents
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
leave every day to work and about 80,000
 
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
out of state residents commute into New
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire every day to work thanks very
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
much good question thank you represent
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
stop thank you um I just um asked the
 
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor this question um the
 
01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.669 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor this question um the
um

01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:10.679 --> 01:39:12.229 align:start position:0%
um
elmi

01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
elmi
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
reports um um average wages in different
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
occupations um is it possible to get the
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who are employed at
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
different wage levels for example how
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
many people are making less than $15 an
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
hour the other question is we often hear
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
well how many people are actually making
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
725 an hour we've heard that it's about
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
a thousand um is there any way to find
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
out what kinds of occupations those are
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
um or is it like such a small number it
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
anonymized um so good good question we
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
did um the economic and labor market
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
information Bureau did put put out a
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
report looking at um minimum wage
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
earners in New Hampshire I can make I
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
can send out the link to that for the
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
full committee but if you um want to go
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
look at it right away if you go on um um
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
the nhes homepage so
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
nhes.nh.gov and you click on data and
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
statistics and as you scroll down you'll
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
see that the the minimum wage report is
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
one of the featured reports thank you um
 
01:40:24.189 --> 01:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
that was done uh
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
I want to say two to three years ago um
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to what we have for um uh
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
wage data so we get uh so there's a
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
couple sources there one we get the
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
quarterly wage and tax reports from
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
employers um employers tell us everyone
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
who worked for them in W2 employment
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
during that quarter and they tell us
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
exactly how much they were paid um
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
during that quarter we don't know
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
whether they are full-time or part-time
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know what their hourly rate of
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
earnings is based on those records it's
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
very minimal amount of information that
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
we have so we all we get as um first
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
name last name social security number
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the amount that they earned um we
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
also get survey based data um through
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau Labor Statistics that does look
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
at occupational earnings and so the
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
occupational earnings the hourly rates
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
that you see in the Publications it's
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
it's um taken from the survey based data
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
um and that does break it down by
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
occupation um and it uh gives a sense of
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
you know which of those occupations are
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
projected to grow which are projected uh
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
to uh lose positions so it does have
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
some data there um the other source of
 
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.470 align:start position:0%
some data there um the other source of
hourly

01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
hourly
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
data we do take the tax and wage reports
 
01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
from employers those uh reports are
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
coded by industry industry so we know
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
based upon the uh North American
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
industrial classification system or
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
nakes code we know whether you're a
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare employer or manufacturer
 
01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or hospitality and we do
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
publish the average um earnings hourly
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
earnings for workers in each of those
 
01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
sectors but it's sector-based not
 
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.510 align:start position:0%
sectors but it's sector-based not
occupational

01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
occupational
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
based thank you thank you representative
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
KES thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I've been looking
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
at some statistical data of remote
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
positions do you guys have a kind of a
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
conduit to track that of how the remote
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
positions are in New Hampshire versus
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
others yeah so um what we have and what
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
we would like to have more of so most of
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
the because the filings from employers
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
don't include that type of information
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have administrative records
 
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
which say definitively how many remote
 
01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:53.950 align:start position:0%
which say definitively how many remote
position

01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh there are in New Hampshire but we do
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
have some survey based data um and we're
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
been looking to do more New Hampshire uh
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
employer surveys around that topic um so
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's something to come in
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
2025 the most recent data that uh I have
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
seen uh put New Hampshire up in the top
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
five states nationally for the the
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
number or percentage of employers that
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
indicate um the uh desire to continue to
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
have some level of remote um whether
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
that be limited remote or full remote um
 
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire was uh uh I think
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
Colorado had the most uh the highest
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of employers looking to
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
continue to offer remote New Hampshire
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
at the second most in that survey and
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
that was a national survey and it was
 
01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:39.830 align:start position:0%
that was a national survey and it was
about

01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
35% of employers uh were looking to
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
continue to have um some level of remote
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
um about over 50% of jobs in New
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are in sectors that it's very
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to have remote um you think
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
about those uh Frontline um customer
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
facing uh type jobs um also
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh construction Health
 
01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
Care uh Hospitality so you know that
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's a little over 50% of our jobs uh
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to have much remote there but
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
most of the growth that I'd indicated in
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
professional technical scientific the
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
highest growing uh industry in terms of
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
number of jobs since the pandemic um
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's an industry that very much lends
 
01:44:25.589 --> 01:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
itself to flexibilities with with
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
scheduling flexibilities of where you're
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to be working so it seems that's
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
what people are demanding and and kind
 
01:44:33.149 --> 01:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
of voting with their feet intending to
 
01:44:36.189 --> 01:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
go to jobs within that sector thank
 
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
you good represent
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you Mr chairman
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
um there there are a couple of questions
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
here that I think um kind of go together
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
so let me let me just ask this so the
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah so the how is the system
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
funded so that people understand um you
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
know how this happens and what the
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
federal role would be uh and then just
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
give us a sense if you could we'll drill
 
01:45:11.589 --> 01:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
more into this and we have a legislation
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
deals with increasing the rate but just
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
give a sense of like what the top rate
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
is and and that kind of stuff so funding
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
you know how you there's an
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
administrative feed that comes out of
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
the employer contributions and things
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
just because this is our first committee
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe the first introduction to
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance for many people
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly representative so the the
 
01:45:37.149 --> 01:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment system is 100% employer
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
funded um employers as I indicated
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
before they file that quarterly tax and
 
01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
wage Report with the Department uh that
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
includes all of the employment that they
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
provided with the a very limited amount
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
of information on each employee and then
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
the employers pay based on their
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
experience-based tax rate um for the
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
wages that they paid out during that
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
quarter uh new states are similar in how
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
they assess unemployment taxes on
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
employers but not exact um so the there
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
are some ways that that is compared in
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
terms of unemployment tax burdens state
 
01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
to state that I can talk about in New
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers pay at their earned
 
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
rate uh on the first
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
$14,000 in annual earnings per employ
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
employee so a new employer in New
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire starts at an earned rate of
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
2.7% um that 2.7% then is adjusted by
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
the solvency controls in our statute so
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
they are referred to as fund balance
 
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
reductions so when the unemployment fund
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
grows to levels approaching and
 
01:46:49.589 --> 01:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
achieving solvency the fund balance
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
reductions reduce those rates and then
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
when the unemployment trust fund um
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
starts to fall below those solvency
 
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
amounts those those those discounts or
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
those fund balance reductions go away so
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
right now that a new that new employer
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
starts at 2.7% for their first year and
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
right now there is a fund balance
 
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
reduction of 1% so they pay it
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
1.7% on the first
 
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
$144,000 in annual wages per employee
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
now the average employer right now is
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
paying at about
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
6% per employee on those first $144,000
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
in annual wages so about $85 per
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
employee per year is what the current
 
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
rate is um that is about the lowest it's
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
been in the last 30 years um and lower
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
than it was prior to the
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh nationally when you compare
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
again um each state has a little bit of
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
a different way of calculating the
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
experience-based tax rate and also on
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
the what the taxable wage base is or
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
that 14,000 some states it's less some
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
states it's more uh when you just take
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
total taxes paid compared against W
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
total wages paid New Hampshire has the
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
third lowest unemployment tax burden in
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
the country currently lowest in the
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh Florida is the lowest uh
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
Mississippi is the second lowest and
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
then New Hampshire
 
01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.910 align:start position:0%
then New Hampshire
at

01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
6% um nationally that that uh um
 
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax burden uh New Hampshire
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
is about a third of the national average
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
and we're a third of what Massachusetts
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh requires of their their employers so
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
um on the revenue side it's completely
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
employer funded that all goes into the
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund that is managed
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
by Employment Security that trust fund
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
currently sits at about $390 million
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
those funds sit with the US Treasury
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
they do not sit in a bank account
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
managed um here in New Hampshire states
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
are required um to have those trust fund
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
dollars be in uh with US Treasury we
 
01:49:08.589 --> 01:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
then draw down from that and deposit
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
into that on a daily basis through our
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
own locally managed accounts so we look
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
at what our demand is going to be for
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
benefit payments we draw that down um
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
each week so that we can make those
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
payments out of out of a local account
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and then as those tax dollars come in
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
they then immediately get deposited same
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
day they come in they go to that
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
Washington based account so uh 390
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
million that's the healthiest uh the the
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's unemployment trust fund
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
has ever been um going into the pandemic
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
just to put it into perspective we were
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
at about $300
 
01:49:48.669 --> 01:49:48.679 align:start position:0%
million um New Hampshire was fortunate
 
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
we did not have to borrow from the
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
federal government in order to pay
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
benefits during the pandemic a lot of
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
states did uh Massachusetts had to
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
borrow uh significantly in order to
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
continue to borrow to pay benefits
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
meaning they depleted their own trust
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
fund um New Hampshire did not have to do
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
that and by all measures right now uh
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
with the federal government they look at
 
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
they uh do a solvency report every year
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
of state's uh trust funds their
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust funds uh New
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is currently solvent um right
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
now I think we're we're above solvency
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
um just because of the years that they
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
take into consideration when they're um
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
evaluating solvency is they look at your
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
your three worst or highest benefit
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
payout years in the last 20 years well
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
one of those is the
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic um an outlier probably
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be factored in to that
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
calculation but it is still New
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is solvent um so employer paid
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund solvent um benefits going out
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh currently as uh representative
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
Flanigan had asked um uh about uh you
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
know low unemployment right now we have
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
about 32 to 3,300 individuals that are
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
collecting unemployment benefits on a on
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
a weekly basis uh we track that and
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
compare that to pre pandemic just to put
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
it into perspective we're slightly lower
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
than we were in 2019 when you look at
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
the same week uh we're running about 5
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
to 10% below volume that we had in 2019
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
which was a good labor market good
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
healthy economy uh Massachusetts kind
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
country as a whole are higher than they
 
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
were they're anywhere from 10 to 15%
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
higher than they were in uh 2019 same
 
01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
week so New Hampshire lower volume of
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims right now um
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
nationally they're looking at a little
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
bit higher when you compare to
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
2019 when someone comes in and files for
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment um as I had indicated it's
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
you have to be initially eligible so you
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
have to be unemployed through no fault
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
of your own most common scenario there
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
is a layoff but there are volunt quit
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
scenarios that could trigger eligibility
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
based upon the circumstances of why
 
01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
someone left employment um those are are
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
um much more likely to be determined
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
ineligible if you're quitting employment
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
um than being considered eligible but we
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
do have scenarios that you could be
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
eligible um when you come in we look at
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
make sure your separation was a
 
01:52:16.589 --> 01:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation so you're
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
unemployed through no fault of your own
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
and then we look at your wages what you
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
had in your four quarter base period for
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
most people their four quarter base
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
period is the first four of the most
 
01:52:29.229 --> 01:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
recently completed five calendar
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
quarters if you don't have enough wages
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
there we'll look at the most recent four
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
completed calendar quarters and you need
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
to have at least $2,800 in uh covered
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
employment so W2 earnings from a New
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employer and two quarters of
 
01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
1,400 in that base period in order to be
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
monetarily eligible for unemployment
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
benefits um right now in New Hampshire
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
your maximum weekly benefit amount is
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
$427 that benefit amount has been at
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
$427 since
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
2007 um in order to be eligible for that
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
you need to have earned at least
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
$41,500 in your four quarter base period
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
um if you come in right at that 415 that
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate for what the
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
benefits that you'll receive of 427 what
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
that represents to the A the wages you
 
01:53:25.149 --> 01:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
are earning it's about a
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
54% wage replacement rate um however
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
when you look at the average base period
 
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
earnings for individuals that are um
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
qualifying for that 427 right now the
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
average base period earnings that
 
01:53:41.550 --> 01:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
they're receiving is about
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
$888,000 so individuals on average
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
qualifying for $427 a week had annual
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
earnings of
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
$888,000 so a wage replacement rate
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's more more down in the line of
 
01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:54.950 align:start position:0%
that's more more down in the line of
around

01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:53:58.350 --> 01:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
30% um you need to demonstrate your
 
01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility every week for which you are
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
unemployed you do that by filing um
 
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
online uh a weekly application where you
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
certify to being able to work available
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
to work and you're conducting an
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
adequate work search to show your
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
attachment to the labor market you're
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
out there um talking to hiring employers
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
you're preparing yourself uh to get back
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
uh we we confirm that with your weekly
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
um um application and then for each week
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
that that occurs you could be paid that
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount uh for up to 26
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
weeks during your benefit year uh New
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does allow you to have
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
part-time work while you're collecting
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh so you're able to have part-time work
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
and you need to report that with your
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
earnings while you're collecting
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment um there is a a um
 
01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
disregard for we do allow you to um earn
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
up to 30% of your weekly benefit amount
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
without it reducing your weekly benefit
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
amount and anything above that we then
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
reduce your weekly benefit amount dollar
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
for dooll with the earnings that you
 
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
receive um right now uh individuals are
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
eligible for up to that 26 weeks on
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
average they're filing for uh 12 and a
 
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
half weeks uh right now that has been
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
creeping up so um from the beginning of
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
2023 to where we are right now average
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
duration or the number of weeks that
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
people are filing for on average has
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
gone up about 2 and a half weeks um so
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we have been watching that slowly
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
increase still one of the lower um
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
average durations in the country uh New
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is usually in the uh uh top
 
01:55:47.950 --> 01:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
five in terms of lowest duration um and
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest exhaustion rates so
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
number of people that use all 20 six
 
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
weeks of their benefits um right now I
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
think we're uh right around 17 uh% of
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
filers exhaust their benefits uh so
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
completely employer funded uh healthy
 
01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
solvent trust fund of 390 million on the
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
benefit side uh weekly certifications
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
weekly eligibility determination and the
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
$427 that's a mouth
 
01:56:26.069 --> 01:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
thank you great question represent
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
Warden yeah when you were talking
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
earlier about the unemployment rates
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
Statewide and such how do you how does
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
an Department account for people who are
 
01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.589 align:start position:0%
an Department account for people who are
$199

01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
$199
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh independent contractors I maybe even
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
that would include like an individual
 
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
proprietor like a plumber who works for
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
him or herself how do you account for
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
those people great question um so the
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate gets Direct derived
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
from the uh monthly survey conducted by
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
US Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
so they do they they do a monthly survey
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
of about 1300 households in New
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and based upon the answers to
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
the questions that are asked that's what
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
then uh gets extrapolated out to
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
determine who uh the number of employed
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
unemployed uh generally if you're
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
working 1099 employment those earnings
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
do not get reported and do not get taxed
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
by the department so it's only your W2
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
um earnings that get reported and are
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax um but depending on
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
the households that are part of the
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
survey each month an individual that is
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh self-employed or working 1099 based
 
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
employment or gig employment um they
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
could be answering those questions in a
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
way that would um put them into the
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
employed group um and uh so I think you
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
get some of that uh self-employment 1099
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
based earnings will get captured in that
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
survey so again it's that survey that
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
determines our labor force number
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
determines the unemployment rate
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
different though than the administrative
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
records that get filed each quarter by
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
employers um and the the job numbers
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:58:22.109 --> 01:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I have
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
a I have a couple questions here I
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to get the answer to
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
these I've done a little research but
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any private sector on
 
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
Employment Insurance options in the
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire or elsewhere in
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
the United
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
States um I'm aware of your bill uh I'm
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
not allowed to ask you later so I figure
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
I ask you now uh no I am not aware of
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
any uh uh private unemployment insurance
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
options um in New Hampshire or in other
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
states um it's worth asking that
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
question as well to the Department of
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
Insurance to the depart to the extent it
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
was an insurance product that would be
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
required to register with them but I'm
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
not aware of any private um unemployment
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
insurance options okay are are you aware
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
of any a followup please are you aware
 
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
of any uh federal or state law that
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
would make it impossible or illegal for
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
private sector unemployment insurance to
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
exist um again um I did prepare some
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
materials for the hearing on your bill
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative later on today uh I
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
think 2:30 is when it's being heard um
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and um uh just to so you're not held in
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
suspense here um we did reach out as we
 
01:59:37.229 --> 01:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
do uh we reach out to the US Department
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
of Labor with every bill that is filed
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
that uh proposes a change um or to do
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
anything to the Unemployment
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program because it is a
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
federal state partnership um and states
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
need to be in Conformity and compliance
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
with Federal requirements um for
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
employers to get a whole host of
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
benefits um so we did reach out to them
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
with a copy of your bill um and um while
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
they said they they do not generally
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
comment on bills that are not looking to
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
make a change as your bill looks to
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
create a study committee um they did say
 
02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:12.679 align:start position:0%
that um and I'll I'll I'll I didn't
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
bring it with me now but I have it for
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
230 a copy of their response that said
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
if there were uh private insurance
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
options uh that could C problems for New
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers so right now uh
 
02:00:27.629 --> 02:00:27.639 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire has an
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
unemployment program that meets Federal
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirements um and we're in compliance
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
and Conformity with Federal requirements
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
um two things happen as a result of that
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
one New Hampshire receives about uh $30
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
million in Grant Awards uh to implement
 
02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
all sorts of programs the unemployment
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
program Reemployment Services programs
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
um and then we also have uh the benefit
 
02:00:55.950 --> 02:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire employers that they
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
get a uh reduction in their federal
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax of 90% as long as they
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
pay their state unemployment tax so
 
02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is in compliance
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
with Federal requirements um considered
 
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
inconformity um New Hampshire employers
 
02:01:16.589 --> 02:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
rather than paying 6% on that first
 
02:01:20.069 --> 02:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
$14,000 in wages to employees um to the
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
feds for their their feuda or their
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
federal unemployment tax they pay uh 6%
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
so a 90% reduction that benefits to
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers about $200 million
 
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
in tax savings per year uh because we
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
have a compliant Unemployment
 
02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program so um if you were
 
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
to uh privatize that and it uh an
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
employer were not paying their state
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax um or the state did not
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
have eligibility um uh rules in place
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
for individuals collecting unemployment
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
that met those Federal requirements that
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
would be in Jeopardy so employers U
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
might be subject to their full feuda
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
their full federal unemployment tax um
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
and again the collectively for the whole
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
state that's about $200
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
million thank you very much okay and uh
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative Hall uh thank you Mr
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
chair are there any special
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
considerations for employers that have
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
no presence in New Hampshire other than
 
02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
employees um another a good question
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen um a increase in
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
registrations for outof State entities
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
that have New Hampshire employment so um
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
where that comes up most right now is
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that are fully remote so I
 
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire and I work for a
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
Minnesota company um I never go out
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
there right I'm in New Hampshire 100% of
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
the time that Minnesota employer is
 
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
required to register in New Hampshire
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
and pay taxes on the wages paid to that
 
02:02:58.990 --> 02:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employee uh so we do have
 
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
you do see some of that particularly
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic an increase
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the number of single employee or low
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
employee um employer registrations with
 
02:03:11.069 --> 02:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
those out ofate employers so if the
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
employee is in New Hampshire um and
 
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're not um going out
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
to that uh other State's location
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
wherever the business might be primarily
 
02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
located they need to reported in New
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the taxes paid on the New
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to New Hampshire on the on
 
02:03:26.639 --> 02:03:28.109 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to New Hampshire on the on
the

02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
wages uh yeah please and do you have any
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
statistics numbers on how many employees
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
there are like that in the state um I
 
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
don't but that's something we can get uh
 
02:03:41.550 --> 02:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
we can uh look at that most of that I do
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
know from having looked at it previously
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is in the um um the growth
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
within professional technical scientific
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
which that's where you have um uh
 
02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:52.669 align:start position:0%
which that's where you have um uh
consult

02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
consult
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
um a lot of Professional Services so a
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
lot of some of that growth has been with
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
those single employee out of state
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
employers but we can get that we can get
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
that statistic for you great thank you
 
02:04:05.629 --> 02:04:05.639 align:start position:0%
and one like one last question uh
 
02:04:05.639 --> 02:04:06.669 align:start position:0%
and one like one last question uh
representative

02:04:06.669 --> 02:04:06.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chair I might have
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
two U thank Mr yes uh getting back to
 
02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:15.870 align:start position:0%
two U thank Mr yes uh getting back to
the

02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
1099 uh as as understand 1099 employees
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
are their wages are not filed not
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
there's not they're not paying in so
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
therefore normally they do not receive
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh benefits although that did happen
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
during covid and that was Federal money
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
I I yes correct yeah it was uh
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility was broadened by the feds
 
02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic period and the
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
dollars that un um self-employed
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
individuals that were unable to conduct
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
their self-employment those were all
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
federally financed benefits small paid
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
by paid by Hampshire employment security
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
but federally financed small followup
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
small thank you and that also would be
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
in Jeopardy if we were to privatize the
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
emplo the unemployment insurance is that
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
correct um it's a good follow-up
 
02:05:08.109 --> 02:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
question for uh US Department of Labor
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
but um I believe if we're not in
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
compliance I think that does jeopardize
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to participate in federal
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
programs normally that only occurs we're
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
only participating in federal benefit
 
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
programs during the uh times of an
 
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
economic downturn um you know pandemic
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
or Great Recession uh usually the feds
 
02:05:32.189 --> 02:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
will come in they'll U increase benefits
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
they'll broaden eligibility they'll
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
increase the number of weeks uh so those
 
02:05:39.149 --> 02:05:39.159 align:start position:0%
types of the ability to participate in
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
those could be jeopardized but again it
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
a lot it would largely depend on what
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
the parameters were for any uh private
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance program tiny tiny
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
little question about uh about the
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
remote workers okay go okay I think this
 
02:05:59.229 --> 02:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
could be a one word
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
response okay uh other the RO remote
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire are there any
 
02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
federal employees that are working
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
remote currently or as of
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday I am sure there are New
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has um rather than go off top
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
of Mind here let me tell you how many
 
02:06:22.990 --> 02:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
federal employees we have
 
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
I was going to be close I was going to
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
say 8,000 we have about 9,000 federal
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
government employees in the state of New
 
02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of those are postal
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
carriers um and then um uh across all
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
other Federal departments but you have
 
02:06:39.149 --> 02:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
9,000 um people in New Hampshire that
 
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
work for the federal government thank
 
02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
you very much they might not be remote
 
02:06:44.189 --> 02:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
right they they could be reporting to
 
02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
their federal office in New Hampshire um
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how many are remote but
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
9,000 federal workers in New Hampshire
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
02:06:57.629 --> 02:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
good to see you again Mr labers um
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
couple things uh we talked about the
 
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund and the employer share um so
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
two questions with the Indulgence of the
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
chair please uh can you speak about the
 
02:07:08.350 --> 02:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
administrative part of that and how
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
that's funded and the penalty phase if
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
the business is out of is out of phase
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
with credits and you know where I'm
 
02:07:19.950 --> 02:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
going yes um all right uh so two things
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
there one the administrative portion of
 
02:07:27.069 --> 02:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
that employer tax so um 282a does have a
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
provision that 410 of
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
1% of the quarterly tax paid paid by
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
employers is uh not put into the trust
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
fund it goes into the administrative
 
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
contribution fund um that money gets
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
used for two things one it go uh $6
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
million a year goes to the job training
 
02:07:50.549 --> 02:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
fund so that uh fund pays for training
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
for individuals
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh who uh are um eligible for Medicaid
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion tanif or snap to help
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
them get back to work it also pays 50%
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to employers for their um
 
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh training cost that they have for
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
their um existing workers it also pays
 
02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
for the Work Ready New Hampshire program
 
02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
that's uh conducted on all the community
 
02:08:16.549 --> 02:08:16.559 align:start position:0%
college system campuses with that uh job
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
Readiness uh free class that they
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
provide to New Hampshire residents um
 
02:08:24.669 --> 02:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
the other portion of it goes to pay the
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
administrative um costs of the
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
department fill the Gap in that is left
 
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
by the inadequacy of the federal grants
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
that we get um and that uh basically uh
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
supports about uh we have 12 New
 
02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works offices the
 
02:08:44.189 --> 02:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
administrative contribution uh supports
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
about six of those 12 so if we had to
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
rely on the federal dollars alone we'd
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
only be able to have six offices instead
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
of our 12
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
um the uh penalties on employers the
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
second question there so New Hampshire
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
we have three uh uh tax rate schedules
 
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
for employers uh the and this is all set
 
02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:04.310 align:start position:0%
for employers uh the and this is all set
within

02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
282a uh the first schedule is for um uh
 
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
positive rated employers positive rated
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
meaning that they have paid more in
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
taxes than we have paid out in
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits to their former
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
employees those employers have the
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
lowest rates as they should they are the
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
least amount of risk to the Unemployment
 
02:09:28.830 --> 02:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program then there is a
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
second table which is for uh newly
 
02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
negative rated employers meaning that in
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
the last um year they um have gone from
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
being a positive rated employer where
 
02:09:44.669 --> 02:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
they have paid more taxes in than we've
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
paid out in benefits to flipping that
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
where we have now paid out more benefits
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
to their former employ employes than
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
they have paid in taxes um so that
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
middle table for those newly negative
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
rated um it has a slightly higher rates
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
than for the positive rated employers
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then for any employer that is
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
negative rated for four years or more or
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
the the chronically negative rated
 
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
employers these are employers with
 
02:10:15.549 --> 02:10:15.559 align:start position:0%
seasonal uh business patterns seasonal
 
02:10:18.189 --> 02:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
layoffs uh those employers pay at table
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
three highest rates and they also have
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
penalties um on them um so when um other
 
02:10:28.830 --> 02:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employers positive rated
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
employers are getting those fund balance
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
reductions um and there's a whole I
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
could go into fund balance reductions
 
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
for we could spend all of lunch on it um
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
um for the negative rated employers they
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
have SE charges or penalties uh to make
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
up for their risk um and and and using
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program quite
 
02:10:50.830 --> 02:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
frequently or release with their former
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
um C they laid off employees um so they
 
02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
pay at higher rates and they have
 
02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
penalties based upon the balance in the
 
02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:58.870 align:start position:0%
penalties based upon the balance in the
trust

02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
trust
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
fund I think that covered it great
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%

Changing of the Guard down in Washington
 
03:05:31.389 --> 03:05:31.399 align:start position:0%

necessary at this
 
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:36.080 align:start position:0%

afternoon to the members of the

committee I'm Christine Wellington I'm
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
from Derry New Hampshire um I'm here as
 
03:06:46.870 --> 03:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
an individual but as a member of the New
 
03:06:49.150 --> 03:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire imigrants rights Network I did
 
03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
send out yesterday a letter um stating
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
our group's opposition to this bill um
 
03:06:57.870 --> 03:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
the ever verify program has been around
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
for about 30 years it's remained
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
unpopular and not well used um some um
 
03:07:07.150 --> 03:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
entities that have Federal contractors
 
03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
are mandated to use it only 10 states in
 
03:07:13.950 --> 03:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
the union mandate employers to use it
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
and even in those States it's ill and
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
underused um and there have been no
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
consequences for those employers it
 
03:07:22.990 --> 03:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be something that's
 
03:07:25.550 --> 03:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
business friendly much less employer
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
friendly um just to go back to the the
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
numbers um in the United States is's
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
approximately um 33 million employers or
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and there's only 1.3 million
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
employeers enrolled in the ever verifi
 
03:07:45.870 --> 03:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
program in New Hampshire there's about
 
03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
2600 employers enrolled in this program
 
03:07:51.710 --> 03:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
but there's almost 40,000 businesses by
 
03:07:54.910 --> 03:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
the um data that I was able to pull out
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
um there are costs and pitfalls to
 
03:07:58.630 --> 03:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
employers especially the smallest
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
employers that don't have um HR uh
 
03:08:05.309 --> 03:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
companies and mechanisms to handle this
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
um and the US Department of Justice in
 
03:08:10.710 --> 03:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
the past has brought lawsuits against um
 
03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
employers that have mishandled it mostly
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
inadvertently uh but still uh that's not
 
03:08:19.190 --> 03:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
something that you want on your record
 
03:08:23.550 --> 03:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
um the uh program has been error written
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
with a lot of false positives meaning
 
03:08:27.790 --> 03:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
that the employee uh was uh
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
misclassified as ineligible to work when
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
that person actually was the law
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
requires that the employer notify the
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
employee but because of the complicated
 
03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
nature of these things especially small
 
03:08:41.269 --> 03:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
employers might not know that and that
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
can get them into trouble and it also
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
cost the employee uh who was actually
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
eligible um you you know a a loss of a
 
03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
job um so we would ask that um the
 
03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
committee uh vote this uh bill in
 
03:09:00.590 --> 03:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
expedient uh to um
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
legislate okay thank you for your
 
03:09:05.550 --> 03:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
testimony uh any questions
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative kill thank you Mr chair
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the best of your knowledge is there
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
any barrier to a an employeer who wants
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
to use ever verify is anyone preventing
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
them from using it if that's the what
 
03:09:22.750 --> 03:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
they want to do no any employer it's a
 
03:09:24.349 --> 03:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
voluntary program right now unless
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
you're in a a mandated jurisdiction so
 
03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
you can do that and I should have
 
03:09:30.429 --> 03:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
pointed out that as we all know every
 
03:09:32.910 --> 03:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
employer every single employer has to uh
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
verify eligibility to U for that
 
03:09:38.469 --> 03:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
employee to be um able to be hired to
 
03:09:40.389 --> 03:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
work and that's through that I9 system
 
03:09:45.429 --> 03:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:47.670 --> 03:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:09:49.550 --> 03:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um have there been
 
03:09:52.269 --> 03:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
any data breaches with this program that
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
you're aware of in my research uh about
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
this program and on the ever verify
 
03:09:59.790 --> 03:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
website I did not see anything about um
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
data breaches I should point out that in
 
03:10:06.190 --> 03:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
2024 40,000 eligible employees were
 
03:10:06.200 --> 03:10:07.309 align:start position:0%
2024 40,000 eligible employees were
initially

03:10:07.309 --> 03:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
initially
 
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
misclassified um Nationwide so there is
 
03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
a significant um era issue thank
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
you representative plig again
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying I did get your
 
03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
email thank you very much um my question
 
03:10:26.510 --> 03:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
is if if someone's denied because of e
 
03:10:28.750 --> 03:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
verify and there is a mistake on the
 
03:10:31.349 --> 03:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
form uh the employer is supposed to
 
03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
advise the the potential employee and
 
03:10:36.510 --> 03:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
give them a certain time to rectify it
 
03:10:39.790 --> 03:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
do they not that is exactly right um the
 
03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
employer is legally obligated to notify
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
the employee often times that does not
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
happen right the employee has nine
 
03:10:50.110 --> 03:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
Federal business days to uh submit the
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
correct information and and presumably
 
03:10:55.229 --> 03:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
then get hired thank you very
 
03:10:58.349 --> 03:10:58.359 align:start position:0%
much thank you and represent Mckenzie
 
03:10:58.359 --> 03:10:59.190 align:start position:0%
much thank you and represent Mckenzie
was

03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
ability um good afternoon thank you for
 
03:11:06.229 --> 03:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony so somebody enters the uh
 
03:11:11.110 --> 03:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
the system they are flagged as being uh
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh in in violation of the law so they
 
03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
get flagged under the under the system
 
03:11:17.710 --> 03:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
they don't correct that what is a
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
consequence long term for somebody who's
 
03:11:22.510 --> 03:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's get flag like that what happens
 
03:11:25.349 --> 03:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
to them in in the actual system well for
 
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
any any person that's wrongfully
 
03:11:30.269 --> 03:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
misclassified because the information in
 
03:11:32.990 --> 03:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
the system is incorrect it it it draws
 
03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
information from both the Department of
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and the Social
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
Security Administration and it's not to
 
03:11:42.429 --> 03:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
determine immigration eligib status it's
 
03:11:45.349 --> 03:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
to determine eligibility to work but if
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
those aren't corrected then this will be
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
repeated over and over for every system
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:00.830 --> 03:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
verify Mr chair um thank you again uh
 
03:12:03.510 --> 03:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
getting to the Chairman's uh question
 
03:12:06.190 --> 03:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
about two-letter names and other
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
variations where some PE in many
 
03:12:10.030 --> 03:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
cultures that people have four or five
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
names that may or be used in the wrong
 
03:12:14.269 --> 03:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
order and I'm thinking I think last time
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
we talked about the uml uh which is Comm
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
in many Scandinavian languages are any
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
of these possible uh triggers for Mis
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
classification absolutely it's input
 
03:12:30.309 --> 03:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
output so I mean I guess the good news
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
is both DHS and Social Security do deal
 
03:12:37.110 --> 03:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
with names and obviously DHS does deal
 
03:12:39.790 --> 03:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
with um names of people that might be
 
03:12:43.150 --> 03:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
not in the majority uh usage like
 
03:12:45.870 --> 03:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're not Smith's and Jones but you're
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
right if if it's not um entered in
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
properly the uh information could come
 
03:12:54.110 --> 03:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
back as ineligible when the person is in
 
03:12:57.150 --> 03:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
fact eligible where the I9 process which
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
the employers have to go through anyhow
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
even if they use the verify you the
 
03:13:05.070 --> 03:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
employer can account for that um by
 
03:13:07.229 --> 03:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the documents and not relying
 
03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
on a machine thank
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
you any further questions representative
 
03:13:16.269 --> 03:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:13:17.710 --> 03:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
um If an employer misuses um the uh the
 
03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
system might that employer be subject to
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit absolutely probably a
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination lawsuit and it could be
 
03:13:31.389 --> 03:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
an action by the US Department of
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
Justice um some employers have
 
03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
wrongfully used it as a screening tool
 
03:13:37.469 --> 03:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
screening only people that they believe
 
03:13:40.269 --> 03:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
are not citizens or it's really supposed
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
to be used if you think you're going to
 
03:13:43.950 --> 03:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
hire that person it's at the time that
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
you'd give them the I9 here let me know
 
03:13:48.630 --> 03:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
that let's finish this process this is
 
03:13:50.910 --> 03:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
when you use e verify but some people
 
03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
use it prematurely and in in for uh
 
03:13:56.590 --> 03:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
improper purposes and again with small
 
03:13:59.190 --> 03:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
employers that raises the risk of
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
misusing it with no actual intention um
 
03:14:08.750 --> 03:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
ignorance seeing no further question
 
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony I
 
03:14:14.870 --> 03:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%

03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
Grace for the business and industry
 
03:14:31.510 --> 03:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
Association uh it's Bia uh we are the
 
03:14:34.030 --> 03:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce and the uh
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturers Association of New
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we do oppose this
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um it would it
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
would create additional regulatory
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
burdens resulting in additional cost for
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
compliance for employers who do not
 
03:14:51.349 --> 03:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
already voluntarily use ever verify
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
under existing law uh the law already
 
03:14:56.830 --> 03:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
requires that uh employers obtain
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
documentation necessary to uh prove that
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
the person is eligible to work um and
 
03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
that gives Employers in the state of New
 
03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:05.469 align:start position:0%
that gives Employers in the state of New
Hampshire

03:15:05.469 --> 03:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:15:08.070 --> 03:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility to use the system that works
 
03:15:09.550 --> 03:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
best for them that allows them to keep
 
03:15:11.950 --> 03:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
cost of compliance low allows us to keep
 
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
a competitive work environment uh
 
03:15:16.710 --> 03:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
because we have a voluntary system many
 
03:15:19.189 --> 03:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
large employers uh choose to use ever
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
verify some do not uh again it all just
 
03:15:25.229 --> 03:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
falls under that purpose of the system
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
which is um ensuring that the employee
 
03:15:30.910 --> 03:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
has the ability to work in our state and
 
03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
we already have that in enshrined in our
 
03:15:35.189 --> 03:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
law with additional flexibility that
 
03:15:38.429 --> 03:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
some other states do not allow employers
 
03:15:39.990 --> 03:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
so we do not believe that this
 
03:15:42.110 --> 03:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
legislation is necessary at this
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
time happy to take any
 
03:15:46.590 --> 03:15:46.600 align:start position:0%

good afternoon thank you very much my
 
03:16:25.950 --> 03:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
name is Daniel Albert I'm the Deputy
 
03:16:27.189 --> 03:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
Commissioner with the New Hampshire
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um I will attempt to
 
03:16:31.790 --> 03:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
be U very brief um the department would
 
03:16:33.309 --> 03:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
just relay that we have reviewed the
 
03:16:35.910 --> 03:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
proposed language we understand um the
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
intended uh purpose of the proposed
 
03:16:39.469 --> 03:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
language specifically we understand that
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be requiring all employers um to use
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
the ever verify system in addition to
 
03:16:46.389 --> 03:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
obtaining the documentation currently
 
03:16:48.389 --> 03:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
required by law showing eligibility to
 
03:16:50.710 --> 03:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
work um we would also relay just as a
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
technical standpoint uh in looking at
 
03:16:55.469 --> 03:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
the proposed language um there is the
 
03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
additional or the added requirement of
 
03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
employers using the ever verify system
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
to verify employment eligibility it
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
maintains the current requirement that
 
03:17:06.229 --> 03:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
the employer has to maintain um
 
03:17:08.670 --> 03:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
documentation for the periods uh
 
03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
documentation for eligibility to work
 
03:17:12.510 --> 03:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
for the periods of time required by
 
03:17:15.710 --> 03:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
federal law as as phrased and in
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the added language it's
 
03:17:20.309 --> 03:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
not all that clear what documentation is
 
03:17:23.309 --> 03:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
being referred to is that the um
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
documentation showing the employees
 
03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility to work you know the I9 the
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
Social Security C the driver's license
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the physical uh
 
03:17:35.309 --> 03:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
documentation or printout used from ever
 
03:17:37.870 --> 03:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
verify or one or the other um so our
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be to perhaps clarify
 
03:17:43.870 --> 03:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
if the intent is for the employer to
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
maintain um the print out or some sort
 
03:17:47.189 --> 03:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
of proof that they we've used the
 
03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
everever verify system in addition to uh
 
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining the documentation showing
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
eligibility to work to make that clear
 
03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
um because as currently uh written it's
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
not so clear which documentation is
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
being uh requested um for maintenance um
 
03:18:03.229 --> 03:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
other than that I'm happy to answer any
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
questions should anybody on the
 
03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee have
 
03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:08.920 align:start position:0%

03:18:20.710 --> 03:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
I want to say this discreetly and maybe
 
03:18:23.469 --> 03:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
you don't know the answer to but if
 
03:18:27.070 --> 03:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
someone came up that they weren't able
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
to work in the state I.E country is
 
03:18:32.950 --> 03:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
there any shared data with
 
03:18:38.150 --> 03:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:41.710 --> 03:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
of I I do not know okay um good I'm glad
 
03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:42.469 align:start position:0%
of I I do not know okay um good I'm glad
you

03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:18:45.469 --> 03:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
didn't in the sense that um it's not
 
03:18:47.189 --> 03:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
something directly regul by the
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so I I do not know
 
03:18:51.870 --> 03:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
much representative aani thank you Mr
 
03:18:56.590 --> 03:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
chairman good to see you again Deputy
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um from an enforcement
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
standpoint from the from your department
 
03:19:04.269 --> 03:19:04.279 align:start position:0%
um would this be a primary offense would
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
this be a secondary offense would there
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
be fines would there be
 
03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
additional you take it from there yes no
 
03:19:14.590 --> 03:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
um so I believe if I understand the
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
question and please correct me if I have
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
it wrong um are you asking whether or
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
not violations if found would be subject
 
03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
to warning prior to penalty um yes so
 
03:19:26.429 --> 03:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
for context under RSA 2731 11a certain
 
03:19:29.189 --> 03:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
types of violations are subject to
 
03:19:31.469 --> 03:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
immediate penalty uh on finding of a
 
03:19:33.990 --> 03:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
violation um and all others are subject
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
to a warning with a 30-day uh correction
 
03:19:37.510 --> 03:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
or cure period for the employer to
 
03:19:39.229 --> 03:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
correct uh the violation U my
 
03:19:42.189 --> 03:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
recollection is per this particular um
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
language this would be subject to
 
03:19:45.349 --> 03:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
violation without
 
03:19:48.750 --> 03:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.760 --> 03:19:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
further

03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions represent K so just just so
 
03:19:57.750 --> 03:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
I'm clear on my colleague Mr avani's
 
03:20:00.189 --> 03:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
Question uh if a if an
 
03:20:04.189 --> 03:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
employer uh didn't use e verify for one
 
03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
or two applicants and someone how
 
03:20:10.030 --> 03:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
someone got wind of that he could be
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
facing uh serious
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
penalties I that would be correct if the
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
department were this language to pass
 
03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
such that employers are now required to
 
03:20:21.550 --> 03:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
utilize the ever verify system in
 
03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
addition to the other stated
 
03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
requirements and the department were to
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
engage with an employer and find in the
 
03:20:29.309 --> 03:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
course of a labor investigation that the
 
03:20:31.469 --> 03:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
employer has failed to comply with the
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
requirement to use e verify it would be
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
subject to penalty as set forth in the
 
03:20:39.189 --> 03:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
statute without warning so the the um
 
03:20:41.429 --> 03:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
warning with with 30 days to cure would
 
03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
not be applicable thank you very much
 
03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:45.389 align:start position:0%
not be applicable thank you very much
you're

03:20:45.389 --> 03:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:20:47.830 --> 03:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
welcome okay I do have a question
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
regarding testimony this morning that
 
03:20:52.830 --> 03:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was in a full state of
 
03:20:55.469 --> 03:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
employment and that many folks were
 
03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
looking for workers what impact would
 
03:21:01.030 --> 03:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
this law have on companies looking for
 
03:21:02.830 --> 03:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
workers would it make make it harder for
 
03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
people to hire do you think I don't know
 
03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
that the department of labor would be in
 
03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
the position to adequately or accurately
 
03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
answer that question um in part large
 
03:21:13.150 --> 03:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
part because we do don't engage with
 
03:21:15.070 --> 03:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development um there are other
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
state agencies that engage with employ
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
ERS and employees more in that context
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that we would have
 
03:21:21.870 --> 03:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient information to be able to
 
03:21:23.189 --> 03:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
weigh in on whether or not there would
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
be an impact on people looking for work
 
03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
or ability to get hired okay thank you
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%

03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
69 that being said this closes the
 
03:21:58.590 --> 03:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
69 and at 1:45 we will hear HB
 
03:22:07.630 --> 03:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
353 so we've got a uh 25 minute Hiatus
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
we cannot start early because it's
 
03:22:13.830 --> 03:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
calendar so moved
 
03:22:16.920 --> 03:22:24.469 align:start position:0%
calendar so moved
25

03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
minutes very
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
straight we could we're
 
03:22:33.670 --> 03:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
not yes I understand that fully
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:53.229 --> 03:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
Tom we're shooting at 3:30 and who
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's best you can state for tally
 
03:23:25.469 --> 03:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
but you get paid $100 a year so
 
03:23:27.870 --> 03:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
completely understand they have to be
 
03:23:30.510 --> 03:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
here to vote though that's that is the
 
03:23:30.520 --> 03:23:33.790 align:start position:0%
here to vote though that's that is the

all right welcome back I'd like to uh
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on House Bill
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
353 an act relative to hearing
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
protection for employees of nightclubs
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
and music venues representative McKenzie
 
03:48:07.950 --> 03:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
are you here to introduce the bill yep
 
03:48:10.950 --> 03:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
awesome four your sir uh thank you Mr
 
03:48:12.510 --> 03:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record my name is Mark
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I am from District 40 the float
 
03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
in Manchester New Hampshire I'm here to
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
introduce uh this legislation and to
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
also explain to you kind of the
 
03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
evolution of this since I started
 
03:48:28.349 --> 03:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
working on this some time ago this
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
um this originally was intended to uh
 
03:48:36.269 --> 03:48:36.279 align:start position:0%
protect uh people who work in um venues
 
03:48:36.279 --> 03:48:37.149 align:start position:0%
protect uh people who work in um venues
music

03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
music
 
03:48:39.309 --> 03:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
venues and what we discovered during the
 
03:48:41.309 --> 03:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
course of working on this is that there
 
03:48:43.990 --> 03:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
is a demarcation between public sector
 
03:48:46.389 --> 03:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
and private sector workers so you've got
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the ooser will cover uh private
 
03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
sector and uh then there is there is
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
some information there is some rules
 
03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
that cover public
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
sector and we have no jurisdiction over
 
03:49:01.630 --> 03:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
the private sector in terms of oia right
 
03:49:03.870 --> 03:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
now we hopefully at some point we you
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
know oia may be part of the state scheme
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
so the idea that we would we would
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
regulate that um would be a very
 
03:49:13.189 --> 03:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to do in term in the
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
confines of our laws I did though during
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
the course of this communicate uh on a
 
03:49:20.309 --> 03:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
number of occasions with OSHA
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
representatives and what I found out is
 
03:49:24.910 --> 03:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
that they that they currently protect
 
03:49:27.389 --> 03:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
workers in the private sector that they
 
03:49:29.790 --> 03:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
have the authority to go in in any place
 
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
that produces news noise which is over
 
03:49:35.710 --> 03:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
and above uh the recommendations that
 
03:49:38.229 --> 03:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
they can go in and basically you know do
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
like they do any other uh uh regulation
 
03:49:43.309 --> 03:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
that they can control that they can go
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
in and they can there ways they can uh
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
encourage people to uh to lower the
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
sound not only in music venues but in
 
03:49:54.149 --> 03:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
all venues you know whether it be you
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
know a particular
 
03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
company so let me just say a little
 
03:50:04.269 --> 03:50:04.279 align:start position:0%
personal piece of This was um I had two
 
03:50:07.269 --> 03:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
two experiences with with hearing loss
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
um one was one's my brother who has been
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
who's had hearing loss since he was a
 
03:50:15.030 --> 03:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
child and I watched him struggl for a
 
03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
number of years uh with with poor
 
03:50:22.349 --> 03:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
hearing I watched uh also um the people
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
that I work with in the fire service who
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
have been exposed for a number of years
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
to very loud noise uh Machinery uh
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
engines Sirens all those kinds of things
 
03:50:39.670 --> 03:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
and what you realize when you get
 
03:50:42.349 --> 03:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
together as a group of firefighters and
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
we get together on a regular basis you
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
realize that many of the firefighters uh
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
that came my generation of firefighters
 
03:50:51.710 --> 03:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
the newal guys are protected ended up
 
03:50:54.550 --> 03:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
with hearing loss so we have a
 
03:50:58.429 --> 03:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
preventable um something is preventable
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
something that we could mitigate uh the
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
danger involved with hearing loss uh and
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
so I I think that as a state though we
 
03:51:11.550 --> 03:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
can't regulate the private sector we can
 
03:51:13.710 --> 03:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh begin the process of looking at this
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
issue uh and potentially uh adjusting
 
03:51:21.149 --> 03:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
the rules so that the rules are more
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
responsive uh and and provide more
 
03:51:26.110 --> 03:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
protection for workers now the
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor is here and I have
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
been in discussions with them and as
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
always they're very helpful uh in in
 
03:51:36.830 --> 03:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
doing uh in offering to work with us uh
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
on the rules now what I would suggest in
 
03:51:44.189 --> 03:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
the in the rules is to mirror some of
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
the is currently in place in terms of
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the federal law and right now
 
03:51:54.510 --> 03:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
there are standards under lab rules
 
03:51:56.910 --> 03:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
1400 but they are different though
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
they're similar but they are different
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
so they have higher thresholds than the
 
03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
federal law would have under nios and uh
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations so I think we can do
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
that but the big gap I think in the the
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh public sector under the lab rules is
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
that there is no long-term
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh look at so when you identify people
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
what is a mitigation program long term
 
03:52:22.590 --> 03:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a matter of going in
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
and say well well it's loud but there
 
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be Industries where you
 
03:52:30.030 --> 03:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily control the the levels
 
03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
all the time so there's a whole process
 
03:52:35.149 --> 03:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
of of of the way that you deal with with
 
03:52:37.510 --> 03:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
that that is not really detailed
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the uh you know in the
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
state law so it's called a hierarchy of
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
controls so you you begin the process of
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
trying to move people out trying to
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
provide hearing protection so there's a
 
03:52:51.070 --> 03:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
whole way of doing that and that's not
 
03:52:53.469 --> 03:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
that is not articulated in the in the
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
current rules now let me say that 85
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
decimal uh is is a normal sound you can
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
go to many restaurants and do that I
 
03:53:05.149 --> 03:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
would suggest so how that you go to the
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
Nar site and you download the app that
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
you can put on your iPhone and the next
 
03:53:13.030 --> 03:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
time you're in a music venue or even and
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
that could be a small bar could be a big
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
one just take a look at how loud that
 
03:53:21.750 --> 03:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
sound is anything over 85 decimals you
 
03:53:23.550 --> 03:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
have to begin the process of backing
 
03:53:25.309 --> 03:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
down the amount of time that you
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
actually can be exposed to it and it's
 
03:53:30.269 --> 03:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
not unusual and I've been doing a little
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
bit of research um uh fieldwork It's Not
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
Unusual to go into a bar or or a venue
 
03:53:41.309 --> 03:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
and have the decimals at 100 now why is
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
that so I can walk out I can simply walk
 
03:53:46.590 --> 03:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
out of this thing but people working in
 
03:53:48.590 --> 03:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
those environments can't necessarily do
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
that and so and so they are uh exposed
 
03:53:55.349 --> 03:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
over and over again to very loud sounds
 
03:53:57.510 --> 03:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
and I think this is one area that that
 
03:53:59.229 --> 03:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
we can work on the state and the
 
03:54:01.070 --> 03:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor is willing to I
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
think there should be more interest by
 
03:54:05.349 --> 03:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
the by oser in terms of helping these
 
03:54:08.910 --> 03:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
workers that said I understand that
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
anybody who works in clubs anybody who's
 
03:54:13.710 --> 03:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
a bartender they that's a very transient
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't have any any
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
representation whatsoever there's no
 
03:54:21.870 --> 03:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
workers Restaurant Association because
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
OSHA said we would be willing to come in
 
03:54:26.149 --> 03:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
and work with people who work on those
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
venues but how you put those people in
 
03:54:31.229 --> 03:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
one room is very difficult it's it's a
 
03:54:33.269 --> 03:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
very difficult business to work in so
 
03:54:36.790 --> 03:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's what I'm suggesting is that we
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
um is that we move forward with some
 
03:54:41.670 --> 03:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
discussion uh in the rules to see if we
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
can modify the rules now we don't need
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
let legislation to modify the rules
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
that'll go in front of jel car when
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's eventually done so this bill you
 
03:54:52.990 --> 03:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
could basically um if if you want itl a
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill we could do that uh if you want to
 
03:54:57.189 --> 03:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
hold it in OB bance and so we come back
 
03:54:59.590 --> 03:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
with the rules or I can just reintroduce
 
03:55:02.429 --> 03:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
some version of it uh perhap uh next
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
year but this the original version that
 
03:55:07.870 --> 03:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
shows is not going to it's we couldn't
 
03:55:10.510 --> 03:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh that would not sustain a
 
03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
challeng here because it's we have no
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of private sector
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of my thing I the do is
 
03:55:22.910 --> 03:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
here and if they'd like to speak uh Mr
 
03:55:26.070 --> 03:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
chairman uh okay I just got it yes I'll
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
get to you in a second I just
 
03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
gotta okay so your last statement was
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't have jurisdiction this
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill won't fly anyway no we we could
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
have we do have jurisdiction over the
 
03:55:39.910 --> 03:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
public sector so there no public night
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
there's no public
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
nightclubs should be well maybe there
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
should be as long as rock I'm good but
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I what I'm what I'm saying is that
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
I think that uh I didn't hit the mark
 
03:55:54.670 --> 03:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
when I originally put this legislation
 
03:55:57.630 --> 03:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
in for specifically nightclubs okay so
 
03:55:59.710 --> 03:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
okay now I understand I'm just uh
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
representive Flanigan and then K thank
 
03:56:06.110 --> 03:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so if I maybe I'm
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
maybe that was helpful because at first
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
you said that um it would be more for
 
03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
the uh public sector because we can't
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
deal with the private sector but this
 
03:56:18.189 --> 03:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
bill specifically says nightclubs and
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
music venues and I thought to the same
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
thing was that the state doesn't have
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
any music venues or nightclubs that they
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
own um but then you talk about so so
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
basically you want the employment
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
security people or work as comp maybe
 
03:56:36.830 --> 03:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah to write a rule sorry followup
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
please yeah you want them to set up
 
03:56:42.590 --> 03:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
rules within their framework through
 
03:56:46.269 --> 03:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
Jael car that basic basically has these
 
03:56:49.389 --> 03:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
sound limits on nightclubs and and music
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
venues I I would I would strike the
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
nightclub stuff completely on the rules
 
03:56:56.189 --> 03:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
I would just say uh and you can talk to
 
03:56:59.830 --> 03:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
them but but there would be a um if I
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
had my way it would be a a rule within
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
and there is currently a rule there
 
03:57:05.830 --> 03:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
would be a matter of building it out
 
03:57:08.349 --> 03:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
there is a rule in lab rules 1400s so be
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
building it out to cover public sector
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
not necessarily nightclubs alone but it
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
would be to cover um uh to cover the
 
03:57:18.309 --> 03:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
public sector noise uh which they do now
 
03:57:20.030 --> 03:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent this would enhance
 
03:57:21.950 --> 03:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
the program they currently have thank
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
you very much representative kill thank
 
03:57:26.469 --> 03:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:57:29.389 --> 03:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
do you realize that many of the people
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
working in these music venues are
 
03:57:36.910 --> 03:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
musicians and they're more likely to be
 
03:57:39.070 --> 03:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
1099s if if they're
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
filing um and not really an employee uh
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
of the venue
 
03:57:48.670 --> 03:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
um yes I I think the part of the
 
03:57:52.149 --> 03:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
research has been to kind of uncover
 
03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
unpack some the way that the industry
 
03:57:57.269 --> 03:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
Works in general but having said
 
03:58:00.269 --> 03:58:00.279 align:start position:0%
that representative what that's a that
 
03:58:02.630 --> 03:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
to the workers is not that that's not
 
03:58:05.550 --> 03:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
good for the workers in in the long run
 
03:58:09.790 --> 03:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
follow up yes please thank you uh so
 
03:58:12.630 --> 03:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
then your your goal is to try to protect
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
all the workers the the servers the uh
 
03:58:19.229 --> 03:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
bartenders The Bouncer and the musicians
 
03:58:21.750 --> 03:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
themselves by having some enforcement
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
some standards of the deciple
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
level the the the legislation as uh as
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
the direction I got to take this would
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
be it would only be covering public
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
sector workers OSHA currently has the
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
capacity to to deal with private sector
 
03:58:39.630 --> 03:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
workers but not they don't have the
 
03:58:41.710 --> 03:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for the public workers so
 
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
this would be a this would be an
 
03:58:45.790 --> 03:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
enhancement of lab R 1400 and there's a
 
03:58:48.429 --> 03:58:48.439 align:start position:0%
number that goes with that um enhance
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
that so that more likely would mirror
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
some of the protections that private
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
sector workers currently have and
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
long-term surveillance programs AUD a
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
audiological testing uh all that stuff
 
03:59:03.389 --> 03:59:03.399 align:start position:0%
would be rolled into the to the newest
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
standard under the 1400 and they're
 
03:59:07.950 --> 03:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
currently looking at those rules now let
 
03:59:12.429 --> 03:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
see thank you okay representative
 
03:59:15.149 --> 03:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you
 
03:59:17.030 --> 03:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
03:59:19.950 --> 03:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
itl and um you've also indicated that
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
this is um a work in progress um it
 
03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't work for the nightclubs
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
but might work for a myriad of other
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
public sector types of employment um
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
might it be beneficial to um have this
 
03:59:36.030 --> 03:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
um as interim study I I know that it's
 
03:59:38.590 --> 03:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
not exact session yet but I just want to
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
get your feel on this whether it would
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
be valuable to have it an interm study
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
so that as it works through with the
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
department and so on um if in the end
 
03:59:50.229 --> 03:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
there's a need for um uh some other type
 
03:59:52.030 --> 03:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
of legislation that you can use this
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill to launch that I I think that's uh
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate um I did send a a note to
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
the to the chair and also to you and
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
about what I think may happen to this
 
04:00:05.469 --> 04:00:05.479 align:start position:0%
legislation but if there's any any
 
04:00:08.429 --> 04:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
interest to retain this and let me work
 
04:00:10.750 --> 04:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Labor on this and
 
04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
this may we may resolve this through
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
Jael car not need any any further
 
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislation on this you're right I
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
misspoke retain not interim study
 
04:00:22.750 --> 04:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
sorry all right any further
 
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate it chairman and if we could
 
04:00:34.149 --> 04:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.110 --> 04:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
Summers good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
my name is Mike Summers I'm the
 
04:00:39.790 --> 04:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
president CEO of the New Hampshire
 
04:00:42.070 --> 04:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
lodging and Restaurant Association we
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
represent about 1,300 restaurant hotels
 
04:00:46.990 --> 04:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
campgrounds etc etc in the hospitality
 
04:00:48.750 --> 04:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
and tourism industry across the state
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
here testifying opposed to this piece of
 
04:00:53.550 --> 04:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um I appreciate all the
 
04:00:55.510 --> 04:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
field work that representative McKenzie
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
has done and we appreciate his um
 
04:01:00.750 --> 04:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
patronage of our uh very busy businesses
 
04:01:03.870 --> 04:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
um but we have some problems with this
 
04:01:06.750 --> 04:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh so for example um there is no
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
definition for music venue so we have to
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
assume that means every restaurant that
 
04:01:12.149 --> 04:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
has live music we would have to assume
 
04:01:14.149 --> 04:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to include every facility
 
04:01:17.389 --> 04:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
that would have a wedding um a wedding
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
party U reunions New Year's Eve party I
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
think anything and everything that would
 
04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
have any kind of music would ultimately
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
get caught up in this um and frankly
 
04:01:29.149 --> 04:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's good percentage of the
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
industry um because none of our business
 
04:01:33.550 --> 04:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
have any expertise in this area this
 
04:01:34.910 --> 04:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
would obviously require that we would
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
have to hire expertise whether that be
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
we would have to hire staff people and
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
then purchase testing equipment etc etc
 
04:01:44.309 --> 04:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
or whether we would have to uh Source it
 
04:01:46.110 --> 04:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
to a third party company either way it
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
ends up being a burden on the
 
04:01:47.920 --> 04:01:50.469 align:start position:0%
ends up being a burden on the
businesses

04:01:50.469 --> 04:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:01:52.830 --> 04:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
um and then obviously some questions
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
about the language in the bill says
 
04:01:56.429 --> 04:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
sustained sound levels must Contin Le
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
for an hour or two hours
 
04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
um just thinking about all the events
 
04:02:02.830 --> 04:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
that I've been to over the years whether
 
04:02:04.590 --> 04:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
it be live music or others I'm thinking
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
that you know within within an hour
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
usually every band has taken some sort
 
04:02:10.030 --> 04:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
of intermission so does then that reset
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
the clock and so then this becomes
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
pointless piece of legislation
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
um so that would be a question we would
 
04:02:15.920 --> 04:02:18.550 align:start position:0%
um so that would be a question we would
have

04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
um uh what does uh take steps to protect
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
employees mean exactly um is this mean
 
04:02:27.389 --> 04:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
that if uh we reach this sustain this
 
04:02:29.550 --> 04:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
sustained level and to protect employees
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
do we have to end the event or does this
 
04:02:34.590 --> 04:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
mean that we have to provide earplugs um
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
or are we talking more like industrial
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
um e muff type scenarios in which case I
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee you there's no server or
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
bartender in the world is going to wear
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
those while they're waiting tables just
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
never going to happen which brings me to
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
my next point that in an a place like a
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
a nightclub type venue where you have
 
04:02:51.870 --> 04:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
bartenders and servers who are
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
predominantly the employees working
 
04:02:55.950 --> 04:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
there if they're wearing uh ear muffs or
 
04:02:58.349 --> 04:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
what or earplugs or whatever how are
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
they going to communicate with staff
 
04:03:01.630 --> 04:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
with their customers to take a drink
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
order order food or whatever it might be
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
so that just creates a whole another
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
level of complexity for our
 
04:03:07.680 --> 04:03:10.349 align:start position:0%
level of complexity for our
businesses

04:03:10.349 --> 04:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and then ultimately what's near not
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
clear to me also is this piece of
 
04:03:16.630 --> 04:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
legislation is how is this going to be
 
04:03:18.870 --> 04:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
enforced are we as businesses going to
 
04:03:20.550 --> 04:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
have to essentially keep records of
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
every single minute of every single
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
event that we ever had for how long and
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
to what level and what format does this
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
have to be kept I think this just
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
creates a whole huge burden on
 
04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
businesses um and I certainly appreciate
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
what representative McKenzie's trying to
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
do here uh you know protecting workers
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
but I also would remind folks that our
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
industry is heavily transient so the
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
folks that work in these facilities they
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
usually work there because they like
 
04:03:45.070 --> 04:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
working there they like the music they
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
like the energy they like the excitement
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
um and they usually gone after a year or
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
two at most so usually these are very
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
short-term employees our industry has a
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
history of just turning over very
 
04:03:56.910 --> 04:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
rapidly so um with that I will end and
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to try to answer any questions
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
you may have thank you for that
 
04:04:03.389 --> 04:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions from the
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee repr
 
04:04:09.070 --> 04:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
K thank you uh Mr chair for taking my
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
for question and thank you Mr Summers do
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
you do you see uh sh as is a viable
 
04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
alternative for taking drink orders with
 
04:04:16.040 --> 04:04:16.830 align:start position:0%
alternative for taking drink orders with
ear

04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
ear
 
04:04:19.269 --> 04:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
Buffs I'm sorry repeat the question uh
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
would you see charades as a viable
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
alternative for communicating the drink
 
04:04:25.469 --> 04:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
order when you're when the server is
 
04:04:26.670 --> 04:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
wearing ear
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
muffs charades I'm going to say no oh
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
no it's hard enough to get a drink of
 
04:04:40.830 --> 04:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
order in a allow restaurant now so yes
 
04:04:42.670 --> 04:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr SU good to see you um
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
just a question on um how would this
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
impact workman's compensation you would
 
04:04:53.790 --> 04:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
think it was a horror I wasn't prepared
 
04:04:57.630 --> 04:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
to open um I no idea uh frankly and then
 
04:04:58.870 --> 04:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
how do you prove it right then it
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
becomes a whole issue of uh he said she
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
said um you know what level I I thought
 
04:05:06.149 --> 04:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
I had enough without that I appreciate
 
04:05:11.189 --> 04:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank so thank you all right thank
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.990 --> 04:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
much and if we can have uh Caroline drwy
 
04:05:28.149 --> 04:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.830 --> 04:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
ma'am all right good afternoon uh
 
04:05:33.429 --> 04:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative kraton and members of the
 
04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee an answer to your question
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.750 --> 04:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
Language um my name is Carol andur I
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
live in nashwa but I'm here today as
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Academy
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
of Audiology so I represent audiologists
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
from around the state um we are asking
 
04:05:57.309 --> 04:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
uh that the committee consider voting
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
not in favor of passing or itl uh most
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
of it from the way the uh the law itself
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
is introduced is pretty difficult to
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
actually even Implement um I appreciate
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative m en's effort and
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
interests and I have family members who
 
04:06:19.870 --> 04:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
are in fire service so I do appreciate
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
that um but it's with most of your
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
venues as Mike said um it's just not
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
really diff just not doable um and have
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
any kind of enforcement again most of
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
these places would have to have a sound
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
they have to first test their employees
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
hearing to even know what what starting
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
level hearing they have you have to have
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
a good sound sound assessment which
 
04:06:46.149 --> 04:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
means you're going to have to have
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
someone in there with microphones all
 
04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
over the The Establishment for about a
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
week um because what you're looking at
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
is a Time weighted average of what is
 
04:06:56.960 --> 04:06:58.229 align:start position:0%
is a Time weighted average of what is
the

04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
approximate no noise level continuous
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
noise level over a period of time um and
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
that in these menus fluctuates
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
consistently it's a very Dynamic
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
environment uh even in your music venues
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
um if they're Outdoors you're better off
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
but even in theaters um or concert Halls
 
04:07:20.349 --> 04:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
uh depending on where you sit your
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
exposure level is different so it's a
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult thing to enforce um as
 
04:07:26.080 --> 04:07:27.550 align:start position:0%
very difficult thing to enforce um as
far

04:07:27.550 --> 04:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
far
 
04:07:31.229 --> 04:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
as managing noise there are different as
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
he said a hierarchy the first one
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
preference being administrative which
 
04:07:37.870 --> 04:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
means you can kind of rotate your people
 
04:07:39.870 --> 04:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
around so that they're not always in the
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
loudest part of the establishment and
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
rotating can control their exposure um
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
in manners like that there are next down
 
04:07:52.269 --> 04:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
the list are engineering controls um in
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
which with equipment of course you can
 
04:07:56.590 --> 04:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
kind of work with the equipment when you
 
04:07:59.030 --> 04:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
get into places like this again you have
 
04:08:02.910 --> 04:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
to look at Acoustic treatment of the uh
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
establishment trying to find ways of
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
being able to subdue some of the
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
resonance and reverberation from a lot
 
04:08:13.710 --> 04:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
of that noise um The Last Choice should
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
be hearing protection uh and again most
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
anyone in this kind of environment is
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
not going to wear a muff those the the
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
oer approved muffs are big heavy things
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
and there's no way anyone who whose job
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
is to talk to people is going to be
 
04:08:32.109 --> 04:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
wearing those they're going to have them
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
hanging around their neck the whole time
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
um it's just ridiculous um to try to use
 
04:08:41.229 --> 04:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
hearing protection standard
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
earplugs are not going to work well
 
04:08:45.550 --> 04:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
either um as Mike like they are
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
completely blocking in order to work
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
which means immediately your employee is
 
04:08:54.510 --> 04:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
going to give himself or herself a 30 DB
 
04:08:57.070 --> 04:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
hearing loss plus it's going to muffle
 
04:08:59.950 --> 04:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
the sound because now it's not only this
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
the noise in the room it's everything
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
that reaches your ear canal so that's
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
where it comes in so now you're going to
 
04:09:10.030 --> 04:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
have a real hard time understanding
 
04:09:11.790 --> 04:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
those people and because you are
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
completely uded your own voice sounds
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
much louder to you so you're have to be
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
even speaking softer it's not going to
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
work it's going to affect their ability
 
04:09:23.149 --> 04:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
to do their job it's going to impact
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
their tips and that's their income
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
predominantly so I can't see anyone who
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
works in that environment willingly
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
voluntarily willing to cooperate and um
 
04:09:36.670 --> 04:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
and do this so enforcement is difficult
 
04:09:39.870 --> 04:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
those plugs are you can have specially
 
04:09:43.149 --> 04:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
made custom plugs but they're costly uh
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
and again you still have to have people
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
willing to to comply and do it you
 
04:09:49.870 --> 04:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
cannot just force them if they're
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
already hired if you're taking on a new
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
hire and you have a program in place you
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
can kind of make them sign an agreement
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh which if they violate that then they
 
04:10:03.030 --> 04:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
have ter you know um reason for
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
termination so you can start easing
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
things in but it's something that would
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
have to be phased in over time uh and as
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
just the law itself I'm not familiar
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
with the new New Hampshire rules be
 
04:10:16.750 --> 04:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
happy to look at them and offer any
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions but the law itself is just
 
04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
not really implementable so again I ask
 
04:10:26.149 --> 04:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
that you vote ought not to pass our itl
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you I thank you for your
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony ma'am any questions
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative k Mr chair and thank you
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I want to
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
preface this with that I'm right
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
currently I'm having trouble hearing my
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
softspoken colleagues on either side of
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
me in conversation I don't know if
 
04:10:46.109 --> 04:10:46.119 align:start position:0%
that's from too much High deciple Grand
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
Funk Railroad in my in my youth uh
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
either playing it on the on the
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
turntable or through the amplifier in in
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
the bands but I have serious hearing
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
loss okay so I wonder I I realize this
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't isn't going to work
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
but is there some idea about uh in our
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
culture sort of trying to dial back the
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
decb when when we
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
listen absolutely in fact some of your
 
04:11:18.630 --> 04:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
um your Apple um music and your iPhones
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
now have a limit of 80 DB as they're
 
04:11:24.189 --> 04:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
maximum loudness and they're starting to
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
work with that um yeah there's a lot
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
going on in your case um it could be in
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
part because of listening to grun
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
Railroad to too often noise induced
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
hearing loss accumulates over time it
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
has to do with the loudness of the Expos
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
exposure the amount of time you're
 
04:11:48.189 --> 04:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
exposed to it and how frequently you're
 
04:11:51.309 --> 04:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
exposed to it and it is cumulative
 
04:11:54.149 --> 04:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
gradually and slowly part of it can also
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
be just plain old Aging in an an
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
advanced technology um
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
highly I'm losing my sorry I just lost
 
04:12:07.269 --> 04:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
my train of thought um in an
 
04:12:07.279 --> 04:12:08.830 align:start position:0%
my train of thought um in an
industrialized

04:12:08.830 --> 04:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
industrialized
 
04:12:11.990 --> 04:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
Society just general noise around us is
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to get into be getting louder
 
04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
so there are many efforts um as a
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
community but first of all you need to
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
get a hearing test and find out what
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
doing thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if we have
 
04:12:29.229 --> 04:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
constituents who work in these
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
industries and they're interested in
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
protecting themselves from hearing loss
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
what were some good ways to work in a
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
nightclub or a restaurant while
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
protecting your
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
hearing uh they again they need to
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
rotate they need to know where the
 
04:12:43.510 --> 04:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
loudest sound is on any given day
 
04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
obviously uh if they want to work on
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
slower days when it's not as crowded
 
04:12:50.149 --> 04:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
there isn't as much conversation in the
 
04:12:52.349 --> 04:12:52.359 align:start position:0%
room they can choose to work those days
 
04:12:54.429 --> 04:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
rather than or reduce their hours only
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
they work part-time on Friday Saturday
 
04:12:58.510 --> 04:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
and Sunday although again that's going
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
to affect their livelihood um again it's
 
04:13:03.229 --> 04:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
about rotating around so that you're not
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
being exposed to very loud noise the
 
04:13:06.520 --> 04:13:09.670 align:start position:0%
being exposed to very loud noise the
whole

04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
time Schultz thank you Mr chair um um I
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
assume you work with employers currently
 
04:13:18.429 --> 04:13:18.439 align:start position:0%
in the private sector if they have
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
concerns or with OSHA I don't I don't
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm retired so no but I worked in a
 
04:13:25.710 --> 04:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
medical office now the first three years
 
04:13:28.590 --> 04:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
of my career as an audiologist yes I
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
work I worked in a firm that did
 
04:13:33.950 --> 04:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
industrial hey conservation programs Mr
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
chair followup absolutely so there's a
 
04:13:39.070 --> 04:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
distinction that the um Bill sponsor
 
04:13:42.269 --> 04:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
made about the private sector is uh
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
subject to Ocean law but the public
 
04:13:47.830 --> 04:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
sector in New Hampshire is not is not
 
04:13:50.830 --> 04:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to assist if we do
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
have a retain retaining this bill to
 
04:13:55.950 --> 04:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
work on it would you be willing to help
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
us strengthen that bill for the public
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
sector I can try I'm not don't know that
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
I'm as current uh on all the regulations
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
but maybe your Association could be but
 
04:14:10.189 --> 04:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
I do I can give you the name of someone
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
who runs a hearing conservation program
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire thank you man'
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:17.279 --> 04:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
sir

04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
represent abalam thank you Mr chairman
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question uh
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
what do you think of the new electronic
 
04:14:25.199 --> 04:14:26.429 align:start position:0%
what do you think of the new electronic
hearing

04:14:26.429 --> 04:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
protectors your personal
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:37.710 --> 04:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
cancelling okay um but yes but it's when
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
you're right in between and when that is
 
04:14:40.910 --> 04:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
going on and off and on and off and on
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
and off because in this kind of um
 
04:14:46.750 --> 04:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
establishment you're going to fluctuate
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 85 8085 up to potentially
 
04:14:53.109 --> 04:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
110 so it's going to be on and off and
 
04:14:55.269 --> 04:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
on and off I can't tell you how I would
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
like that um I'd have to experience it
 
04:15:02.349 --> 04:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.510 --> 04:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
Annoying all right seeing no further
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions ma'am thank you so much for
 
04:15:09.070 --> 04:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony we appreciate
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:15.760 --> 04:15:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
back good afternoon thank you um my name
 
04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
is John garrian I'm general counsel at
 
04:15:29.109 --> 04:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor with me is
 
04:15:32.830 --> 04:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Danielle Albert um
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
as representative McKenzie said uh the
 
04:15:36.790 --> 04:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
department has a rule on this in
 
04:15:39.389 --> 04:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
administrative rule it's
 
04:15:43.710 --> 04:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
14341 um that has um an acceptable chart
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
of acceptable um noise exposure and it
 
04:15:50.189 --> 04:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
runs um depending on the level and the
 
04:15:53.149 --> 04:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
time so the chart runs from 90 DB over8
 
04:15:56.349 --> 04:15:56.359 align:start position:0%
hours all the way to 114 DB for a span
 
04:15:59.309 --> 04:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
of about 15 minutes um those regulations
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
apply to all public employers and in all
 
04:16:03.510 --> 04:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
employment circumstances usually we're
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
talking like um machine rooms or engines
 
04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
um not usually music but it applies
 
04:16:13.710 --> 04:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
across the board um that rule uh as well
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
as our other safety rules up for read
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
adoption uh this coming spring uh we are
 
04:16:19.510 --> 04:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
happy to work with any representative or
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
interested party on reviewing those um
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
the standards that that are in that rule
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
that 90 DB to 114 DB those actually
 
04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
mirror the OSHA standards for um noise
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
exposure they are different than the
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
niosh standards which representative
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
McKenzie referred to um but they do
 
04:16:36.910 --> 04:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
provide the same OSHA level protection
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
in the public sector I'm happy to answer
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
aani thank you Mr chairman and good to
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
see you
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
again um so the same question I asked Mr
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
summer is um how would this if you were
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
to overrule this and make uh requ
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
requirement regulations and somebody
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for um that how would it
 
04:17:05.670 --> 04:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
affect workman's compensation granted
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're not doing the private section but
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
for uh public workers and also uh
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
liability for the state um as as well
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
and then I have a followup after that
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes U thank you for the for the question
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh you as I understand you're asking
 
04:17:22.630 --> 04:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
about um impact on the workers
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
compensation system I think that would
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
be somewhat difficult to quantify so
 
04:17:29.469 --> 04:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
employees there's nothing that bars or
 
04:17:32.109 --> 04:17:32.119 align:start position:0%
precludes employees from asserting and
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
having valid workers compensation claims
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh due to hearing loss from noise
 
04:17:39.790 --> 04:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
exposure or any other sort of uh
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
occupational illness or injury that they
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
may obtain so can be a compensable claim
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
um you know the impact that if the
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
language as proposed went into effect
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
that would have on the uh overall
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
injuries I don't know how the department
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
would necessarily be able to quantify
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
that if it is putting you know further
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
Protections in place to limit noise
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
exposure I think it's u fair or or
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
arguable to say that could perhaps limit
 
04:18:07.149 --> 04:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
some uh injuries but I don't know that
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
the department would be able to put like
 
04:18:11.309 --> 04:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
a firm number or give an estimate as to
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
you know how much that could alter or
 
04:18:15.429 --> 04:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
affect uh injury claims being brought
 
04:18:17.070 --> 04:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
forward but nothing would preclude a
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
claim from being brought forward um just
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
as it is right now for a followup please
 
04:18:27.309 --> 04:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of kind of the answer um
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
if we were going to rule if we use rules
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
to enforce the regulations you know 90
 
04:18:36.109 --> 04:18:36.119 align:start position:0%
Deb for so long um should we put this in
 
04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
more into the protection clause for
 
04:18:40.990 --> 04:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
public sector employees instead of we
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
were doing it through rules
 
04:18:46.349 --> 04:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I may have you rephrase the question
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
so forgive me um are you asking whether
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
or or as I understand are you asking
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
whether it should be built into the
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
statute through the like the general
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
protections Clause
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
section I think that's a determination
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
where you know how the committee wants
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
to approach it I think that's a
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
determination that's a policy
 
04:19:06.990 --> 04:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
determination I believe what attorney
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
garrian was emphasizing we do have an
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
existing rule that mirrors the OSHA
 
04:19:14.109 --> 04:19:14.119 align:start position:0%
protections that in place for public
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
employees in all noise oriented
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
scenarios not just limited to
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh and and night clubs um
 
04:19:23.429 --> 04:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
certainly could that be drawn up into
 
04:19:25.950 --> 04:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
statute I think that it I don't think
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
anything would stop the committee from
 
04:19:28.269 --> 04:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
doing so I think that's what this
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
proposal is intending to do um it also
 
04:19:33.790 --> 04:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
could be addressed through the rules as
 
04:19:36.269 --> 04:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
it currently is it sounds like some of
 
04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
the um intent from uh representative
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
McKenzie is to make the rule a little
 
04:19:46.510 --> 04:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
bit stricter than it currently is um to
 
04:19:48.750 --> 04:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
mirror some of the I think it's naos
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
requirements as opposed to the OSHA
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
requirements um but I think it could be
 
04:19:54.030 --> 04:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
approached in either way we do have
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
existing rules regulating the public
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
sector as it relates to noise exposure
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
so um that exists
 
04:20:03.149 --> 04:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
already representative
 
04:20:05.229 --> 04:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
labr thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:20:08.189 --> 04:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um these days how
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
many claims does the department see for
 
04:20:13.030 --> 04:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
hearing related comp issues
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question it's a
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
very good question I don't have solid
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
numbers today uh here with me right now
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
I will I can globally or more generally
 
04:20:23.870 --> 04:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
say in the grand scheme of disputed
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
claims um hearing is not hearing
 
04:20:29.710 --> 04:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
injuries are not a high percentage um
 
04:20:31.469 --> 04:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
certainly if the committee is looking
 
04:20:33.550 --> 04:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
for firmer numbers about how many
 
04:20:35.229 --> 04:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
hearing related injuries are reported
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
per year that is a number that we could
 
04:20:38.910 --> 04:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
try to generate for you okay thank you
 
04:20:38.920 --> 04:20:40.229 align:start position:0%
try to generate for you okay thank you
you're

04:20:40.229 --> 04:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Hall thank you Mr
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:20:46.590 --> 04:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
is there anything you're aware of that
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
would prevent an employee from deciding
 
04:20:52.590 --> 04:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
themselves to wear some sort of hearing
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
protection assuming they were able to
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
fulfill their job function while doing
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
so not that I'm aware of nor nothing
 
04:21:03.149 --> 04:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
that would fall under the Department's
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
04:21:12.070 --> 04:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your testimony thank
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
you and
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh any other business on
 
04:21:20.670 --> 04:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
353 um repr thank you Mr chairman in
 
04:21:23.550 --> 04:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
light of the fact you you noticed in the
 
04:21:27.030 --> 04:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
agenda that we can EXA
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
bills today because it's listed and in
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that the bill really
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet what the sponsor has but
 
04:21:39.309 --> 04:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
would would a motion to itl be
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time I no
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay no no we have an agreement but
 
04:21:47.389 --> 04:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to we're not going to do
 
04:21:49.149 --> 04:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
it unless we both agree and I'm not

inclined to do that that's fine I'm just

I'm opening the hearing on House Bill
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
128 an act establishing a committee to
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
study unemployment
 
04:32:53.590 --> 04:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
insurance to introduce this bill we have
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative Granger sir the floor is
 
04:32:59.109 --> 04:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
yours thank you very much Mr chair and
 
04:33:00.030 --> 04:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee unemployment insurance is a
 
04:33:04.510 --> 04:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
very strange industry it's a very
 
04:33:06.990 --> 04:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
strange product every other form of
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
insurance that you can buy there are
 
04:33:10.629 --> 04:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
multiple versions of the product that
 
04:33:12.510 --> 04:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
are available doesn't matter if it's car
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
insurance life insurance health
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
insurance you can decide to have high
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
deductible low deductible and you can
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
decide what sort of coverage you need
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
for your particular circumstances and it
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
came up last year for those of you who
 
04:33:27.310 --> 04:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
were on the committee last year that
 
04:33:29.629 --> 04:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
there was a an interest in raising the
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit in the state of New
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the unemployment benefit
 
04:33:38.269 --> 04:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is paid by the
 
04:33:42.029 --> 04:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
employers for the employees
 
04:33:43.869 --> 04:33:43.879 align:start position:0%
and so that means that we have this
 
04:33:47.429 --> 04:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
strange scenario where if an employee
 
04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
wants more unemployment insurance then
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
they don't really have any other options
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's only one unemployment insurance
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
and if you have six kids and you live in
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
a half a million dollar house and you
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
have the same job as a bachelor who has
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
no kids and lives in an apartment you
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
have the same exact unemployment payout
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what your
 
04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances are it doesn't matter what
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
your socioeconomic background is it
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what your priorities are
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
there is one unemployment plan for
 
04:34:23.629 --> 04:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
everybody and this is very strange this
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
is the only insurance that is out there
 
04:34:29.869 --> 04:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
that is like that there's other scenar
 
04:34:31.869 --> 04:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
there's other insurance products that
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
are in a similar boat in one sense so
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
most of us use health insurance that is
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
provided by an employer or many of us do
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if most of us and in that
 
04:34:44.670 --> 04:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
scenario the employer is paying for it
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
but they usually offer more than one
 
04:34:50.109 --> 04:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
plan so they have some employees and
 
04:34:51.910 --> 04:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
those employees don't have any children
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
or dependants and so perhaps your
 
04:34:55.949 --> 04:34:55.959 align:start position:0%
employer just give pays for your
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
insurance for free maybe you have
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
dependents maybe you want to tack them
 
04:35:01.590 --> 04:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
on you know maybe you want to have a
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
higher level of insurance maybe you're
 
04:35:04.109 --> 04:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
like me and you don't want health
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
insurance at all because you're part of
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
a health sharing Ministry and you that
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
works out well for
 
04:35:11.789 --> 04:35:11.799 align:start position:0%
you when it comes to the unemployment
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance specifically we cannot change
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
it without changing it for everyone
 
04:35:19.551 --> 04:35:19.561 align:start position:0%
because there's only one product and
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
that is the product I will tell you I
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
have never taken unemployment payouts in
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
my life ever so every dollar that is
 
04:35:30.349 --> 04:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
paid on my behalf toward the employment
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
system unemployment system is what is is
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
not something that I'm ever going to see
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
again it's just dead weight loss now
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
other people there is a genuine interest
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
and a need for unemployment insurance
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
especially if you're working in an
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
industry where you aren't as likely to
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
be fully employed for a long period of
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
time you might want to manage that risk
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
of losing your job by having some sort
 
04:35:58.269 --> 04:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
of Alternative Insurance for this uh
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
however there is none of that there are
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
zero options I looked like mad I found
 
04:36:05.189 --> 04:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
one company that claimed to provide
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance in the private
 
04:36:08.830 --> 04:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
sector and I don't think they actually
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
do it's a very sketchy website I wasn't
 
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
able to get any information from them I
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
got a giggle over there and uh it it is
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
what it is so that's what this bill is
 
04:36:20.910 --> 04:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
about I did as much research as I
 
04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
possibly could on this subject but there
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
has to be some reason that this is the
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
only insurance industry that operates
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
like this where it's purely socialized
 
04:36:33.869 --> 04:36:33.879 align:start position:0%
one size fits all there's no private
 
04:36:35.590 --> 04:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
market for it whatsoever it's not even
 
04:36:37.470 --> 04:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
like a mandate like Affordable Care Act
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
mandate right so if you remember the
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act mandate you could
 
04:36:44.189 --> 04:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
buy you could choose your own insurance
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
provider but you had to go and you had
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
to have insurance otherwise you'd get
 
04:36:52.910 --> 04:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
penalized on uh your tax return you I
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a Boggle to me and if I
 
04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
and the reason I submitted this as a
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
study committee was there's no we don't
 
04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
even know how to fix it because we don't
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
know why it's like this in the first
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
place now there are some that have
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
pretty good theories so for instance
 
04:37:08.349 --> 04:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
there's the idea that since the federal
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
government is involved in this and
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
because every state has their own
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
unemployment scheme that crowds out the
 
04:37:15.910 --> 04:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
market so it's not profitable for a
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
private sector insurer to actually
 
04:37:20.109 --> 04:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
provide this coverage do I know that
 
04:37:21.670 --> 04:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's the case I don't know that's the
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
case it's a good theory it's a you know
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
it might be the case um it's also
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
possible that there's just a strict ban
 
04:37:30.510 --> 04:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
on it maybe there's some federal law
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
that I was not able to find that just
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
bans it and it's not well publicized
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
because people don't generally try to
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
start unemployment industry or
 
04:37:37.561 --> 04:37:38.750 align:start position:0%
start unemployment industry or
unemployment

04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
companies but it's it's worth asking
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
because if you have a large family and
 
04:37:48.390 --> 04:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
you have to pay for that family if
 
04:37:49.709 --> 04:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
you're the sole bread winner for that
 
04:37:51.709 --> 04:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
family the amount that you're going to
 
04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
get on the federal unemployment scheme
 
04:37:56.670 --> 04:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
might not be enough for you and there is
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with you out of your own
 
04:38:00.750 --> 04:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
pocket buying more unemployment
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
insurance than the state requires and if
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
you are like me and you don't use
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance at all because it
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
you just wouldn't do such a thing then
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
there's no need to have you pay for it
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
either because that's just pure loss so
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's a I think it's an important
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
question to ask and that's why I put it
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
in as a study committee now if I can get
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
the answer like real answers not
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
satisfying answers but answers that I'm
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
satisfied are in fact the answer to the
 
04:38:33.629 --> 04:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
questions that are put out in the text
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
then I'll be happy and then I'll be able
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
to figure out what to do from there but
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
um this this has been driving me nuts
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out out the answer to
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
this question why is there no such thing
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
as private sector unemployment
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
insurance and so uh I'll let you guys
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
ask me questions and I might not have
 
04:38:53.949 --> 04:38:53.959 align:start position:0%
answers but maybe we'll find answers
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
okay are there any
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
questions I I do have a question and so
 
04:38:59.680 --> 04:39:00.551 align:start position:0%
questions I I do have a question and so
I

04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused by the no
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
insurance so my daughter has on
 
04:39:08.429 --> 04:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
Employment Insurance that's
 
04:39:11.551 --> 04:39:11.561 align:start position:0%
private um I mean it's specific because
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
she's a veterinarian she's pregnant she
 
04:39:17.629 --> 04:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
had to get insurance because her company
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
does not provide any pregnancy leave or
 
04:39:23.070 --> 04:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
04:39:26.429 --> 04:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
that um and so she just went out and she
 
04:39:28.830 --> 04:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
had to get it nine months before she was
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
pregnant so it wasn't a after Thea type
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
of thing but um is that the type of
 
04:39:36.390 --> 04:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
thing you're talking about or you're
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about if someone gets
 
04:39:39.628 --> 04:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
laid off cuz she's going to be out of
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
the net for 6 months and this
 
04:39:44.430 --> 04:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
this plan covers her for six months so
 
04:39:45.628 --> 04:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
you talking more like a Paid Family
 
04:39:45.638 --> 04:39:46.868 align:start position:0%
you talking more like a Paid Family
Leave

04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
Leave
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
plan oh I mean it's an unemployment is
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
that she can't work so I don't know
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's a disability or I don't
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
know how they classify that so I I don't
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking if that's the type of
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
thing you're looking at
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
or well what I have in mind is more if
 
04:40:07.628 --> 04:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
you lose your job unexpectedly so you're
 
04:40:09.990 --> 04:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
laid off or something like that um now
 
04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's probably related to other forms
 
04:40:13.628 --> 04:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
of insurance that you can get for you
 
04:40:16.110 --> 04:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
know family leave or you know workman's
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
comp or whatever the case may be because
 
04:40:20.550 --> 04:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
there is you know workman's compensation
 
04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
so but it but specifically for getting
 
04:40:26.190 --> 04:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
laid off or what we would normally
 
04:40:28.030 --> 04:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
provide for or would would normally be
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
covered by the department of un
 
04:40:32.910 --> 04:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
gotcha representa Paul thank you Mr
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:40:39.990 --> 04:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
is there any scope in your mind to
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
having the state employment unemployment
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
insurance um offerings expanded have
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
multiple tiers that people could choose
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
just like you would a health insurance
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
plan I think the difficulty with that is
 
04:41:01.150 --> 04:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
that since the employer pays for it that
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
means that the customer is not the
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
person who's receiving the benefits and
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
so what would likely happen is that
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
employers would consistently choose the
 
04:41:12.550 --> 04:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
cheapest option and uh since they're the
 
04:41:16.628 --> 04:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
it yes
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
please so in the same way that employers
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
offer multiple health insurance plans
 
04:41:28.868 --> 04:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
some that they pay the full amount for
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
others that the employee contributes to
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't the same thing be
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
done maybe uh not under the current
 
04:41:37.550 --> 04:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
system and I don't know how we would go
 
04:41:41.310 --> 04:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
about legislating it um but uh that that
 
04:41:43.150 --> 04:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
that could that would be an improvement
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
at least because right because there's
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
then there is at least some Choice
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
rather than no choice
 
04:41:54.190 --> 04:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever okay thank
 
04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
you do you have a question uh I'm Gonna
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
Save it first okay good
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:42:07.150 --> 04:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking our questions uh if I see
 
04:42:09.788 --> 04:42:09.798 align:start position:0%
this correctly what you're trying to do
 
04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
to well first of all is you include the
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
senate in this you only have the house
 
04:42:14.830 --> 04:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
members there's no Senate because if it
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
goes to the Senate they'll say they'll
 
04:42:17.830 --> 04:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
either at it or they'll kill it because
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
they're not involved um the um but if I
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying is you
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
work for me as a company okay and I have
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
insurance through the Department of
 
04:42:32.190 --> 04:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
Employment Security and if if you get
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
laid off you get the $300 or $400 a week
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
and what you're saying is you want to be
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
able to buy it privately if there was an
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
entity out there that would sell it if
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's what the committee came up with
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
so that you could have more income
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
coming in if you lost a job from my
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
company right uh yeah so if if if there
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
is a person who is an employee and they
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
want to purchase an employment insurance
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
on on top of maybe on top of what they
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
are offered through their employer or
 
04:43:04.750 --> 04:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
maybe in spite of or you know as an
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
alternative to what's provided by their
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
employer why shouldn't they be able to
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
argument represent KO thank you Mr chair
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
I did think of one awesome yeah uh thank
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
you uh representative does it stand to
 
04:43:28.350 --> 04:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
reason that if the employee wanted to
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
buy more Insurance it might cost a lot
 
04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
more than his than his employer is
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
paying for what he's got uh as a
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
standard yes
 
04:43:46.030 --> 04:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
follow up please thank you and does it
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
seem that if there if there really was
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
money to be made in this and or better
 
04:43:53.310 --> 04:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
service to be offered would it be likely
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies would have been
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
clamoring to do this even before you
 
04:43:57.708 --> 04:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
thought of
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
it well isn't that the great question
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
why aren't they is is there is it
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
illegal I don't know um and I'm not I
 
04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
don't want I don't intend to ask
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
questions of the committee but
 
04:44:10.750 --> 04:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
rhetorically speaking I don't know the
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
answer to that and that's why I have a
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
study committee and maybe we can find
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
out okay thank you great thank
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
you representative C question thank you
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for the qu or
 
04:44:26.310 --> 04:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
letting me ask the question
 
04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with uh companies
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
like afflac and supplemental insurance
 
04:44:31.948 --> 04:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
companies because it sounds kind of like
 
04:44:33.310 --> 04:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
that's what you're talking
 
04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
about I I believe I I'm familiar with
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
many of the products that they offer but
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
not all of them I was not able to find
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing from afflac or
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
similar companies follow please okay so
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
as far as my experience goes with this
 
04:44:50.470 --> 04:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
I've actually done this a little bit
 
04:44:52.350 --> 04:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
with my own business and those other
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
ones are kind of supplemental just like
 
04:44:56.350 --> 04:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair had talked about his it was
 
04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
your daughter um it seems like that's
 
04:45:00.510 --> 04:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
kind of where you're leaning towards but
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
um again it might be more of a question
 
04:45:06.270 --> 04:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.270 --> 04:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
security uh maybe uh M Mr lavs was nice
 
04:45:12.430 --> 04:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
enough to actually bark it up the chain
 
04:45:14.910 --> 04:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
at the Federal Department of Labor and
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
uh they they were provided a response
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't very informative um but it
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
I I definitely appreciate the effort
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
because I I mostly just want an answer
 
04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
these questions you know like um I'm a
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
specific policy goal is not really
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
what's being uh presented here although
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
you guys can probably figure out that I
 
04:45:36.310 --> 04:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
would really like to have private sector
 
04:45:37.390 --> 04:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance I think that
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
would be a great thing for the New
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy and just as a option
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
for workers in general um but um we
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
can't actually do that unless we
 
04:45:48.030 --> 04:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
actually know what is preventing that in
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
the first place and it could be the case
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
that it is purely the market U because
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
there is currently a public sector
 
04:45:58.270 --> 04:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment option out there it just
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any Financial sense to
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
compete in that market it could be the
 
04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
case I don't know that it's not the case
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
but um it it it's worth figuring
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
out represent d sestro
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking the question so
 
04:46:16.868 --> 04:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
if they have private insurance are you
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
thinking that they would stay out of
 
04:46:18.320 --> 04:46:19.628 align:start position:0%
thinking that they would stay out of
work

04:46:19.628 --> 04:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
longer the whole purpose of unemployment
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
is to pay for a period of time when you
 
04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
are not working to help carry you over
 
04:46:29.708 --> 04:46:29.718 align:start position:0%
and the anticipation is you're going to
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
job I think it's up to people's choices
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
as to whether like so we don't want to
 
04:46:44.470 --> 04:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
pay for for people to be unemployed for
 
04:46:47.708 --> 04:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
longer than we would like to right we we
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
want them to generally get back to work
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
however if they're paying for their own
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance far be it for me
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
to tell some insurance company what the
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
rules ought to be um if they say that we
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
want to encourage people to get back to
 
04:47:00.548 --> 04:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
work then they can get back to work if
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
they want to say well um you you uh paid
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
for this benefit and you're going to
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
write it out because you have a
 
04:47:09.150 --> 04:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason per our rules to uh
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
not have uh or to not have a job and you
 
04:47:13.470 --> 04:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
you know you were laid off or whatever
 
04:47:14.708 --> 04:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
and uh you want to write it out until
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
the end of the contract um and you know
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
and if that person never goes back to
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
work it's not really my job to tell them
 
04:47:24.670 --> 04:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
that they must um it's it's up to you
 
04:47:26.270 --> 04:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
know individual private contracts at
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
that point and um if if if you're
 
04:47:31.548 --> 04:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
running an insurance company and you say
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
no you you have to be looking for a job
 
04:47:35.788 --> 04:47:35.798 align:start position:0%
so right now the Department of
 
04:47:37.548 --> 04:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
Employment Security spends a lot of time
 
04:47:39.510 --> 04:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
and energy ensuring that people are
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
looking for a job and they have a
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to the
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to do that and uh that's a
 
04:47:46.830 --> 04:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
great thing for them to be doing and I'm
 
04:47:49.628 --> 04:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
very glad that they're um good at it uh
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
it makes me very happy it's it's a very
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
responsible thing for them to be doing
 
04:47:55.110 --> 04:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
for a private company that would be in
 
04:47:56.788 --> 04:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
theory you know that we're talking and
 
04:47:59.110 --> 04:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
this is all you know hypothetical if
 
04:48:00.548 --> 04:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
they were providing unemployment
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
insurance it's up to them whether they
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
care about telling people they need to
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
get back to work or requiring them to
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
have any work programs like my wife
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't work uh she's a stay-at-home mom
 
04:48:12.670 --> 04:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's plenty of uh perfectly
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
valid reasons to not work and um it it
 
04:48:19.390 --> 04:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's if if the if they want to have like
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
some requirement that you must be
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
looking for a job or something like that
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
and they want to police that on their
 
04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
own I don't see it hypothetically
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be my perview to tell them not
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
to um but not necessarily that they
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
to okay representative McKenzie you good
 
04:48:39.310 --> 04:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
no okay representative McKenzie thank
 
04:48:42.030 --> 04:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um um we heard
 
04:48:45.310 --> 04:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
earlier that the cost per employer in
 
04:48:45.320 --> 04:48:46.470 align:start position:0%
earlier that the cost per employer in
New

04:48:46.470 --> 04:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:48:50.110 --> 04:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for employees is
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
$85 the entire cost for the program is
 
04:48:57.510 --> 04:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
$85 do you believe that there is an
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company uh in the state of New
 
04:49:02.548 --> 04:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the United States of
 
04:49:06.510 --> 04:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
America that would offer a policy to
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
protect hundreds of workers uh and could
 
04:49:14.310 --> 04:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
be a big work Workforce for $85 a person
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
and and pay a benefit and pay the
 
04:49:19.150 --> 04:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
benefits that's currently in the
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
system uh they may they may not um it's
 
04:49:23.310 --> 04:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
it's really up to them to do a cost
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis they for for instance
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
hypothetically what if they only decided
 
04:49:30.430 --> 04:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
to sell their services to people that
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
are very very unlikely to ever lose
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
their job or maybe they had you know
 
04:49:38.350 --> 04:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
some other method that they did or maybe
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
they gambled all the money on the market
 
04:49:41.310 --> 04:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
and made a bunch of money on it that way
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
or you know maybe uh we we we can only
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
speculate as to how exactly they would
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
run things and um it is entirely
 
04:49:51.868 --> 04:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
possible as I said that the reason this
 
04:49:53.670 --> 04:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist at all is because there's
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
no market for it um however you can
 
04:49:58.030 --> 04:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
defin you you guys were making a very
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
good point last year when you said that
 
04:50:01.150 --> 04:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh the amount that is currently paid out
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
in unemployment isn't enough so if
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
that's the case then why not explore
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
options for private sector options or PR
 
04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
private sector uh
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
why not explore private sector options
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
as a
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
possibility rhetorically I'm not asking
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
members I'm not asking questions to the
 
04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
committee okay all right seeing no
 
04:50:23.990 --> 04:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative thank
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
you for introducing the Bill thank you
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
for your candid testimony and uh we'll
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
all right sir please uh introduce
 
04:51:07.548 --> 04:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
yourself and then um let's see what you
 
04:51:09.628 --> 04:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
have to say all right Mr chairman uh
 
04:51:11.548 --> 04:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
Richard lers deputy commissioner with
 
04:51:12.548 --> 04:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
Employment Security thank you uh for
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
having me back uh what I just handed out
 
04:51:19.628 --> 04:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
to the members and I had uh provided a
 
04:51:21.548 --> 04:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
copy to the sponsor on the way into
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
today's hearing was a response to an
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
email that the department had sent to
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Labor um so as I
 
04:51:30.990 --> 04:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
had indicated earlier anytime there's a
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
a proposal to make a change to the
 
04:51:35.390 --> 04:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
Unemployment Compensation Program either
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
on the revenue side and how employers
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
are taxed or on the benefit side and how
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
individuals qualify for benefits we
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
submit that to usdl they do a Conformity
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
and compliance review um and so it's
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
standard course for us to do that
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
nothing special with this proposal um so
 
04:51:55.510 --> 04:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
we provided that we did get a quick
 
04:51:57.708 --> 04:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
response um and you'll see that it's a
 
04:51:59.788 --> 04:51:59.798 align:start position:0%
email back from Nicole Robertson she's
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
an attorney with the US Department of
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
Labor saying because this is just
 
04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
looking to create a study committee um
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
there is no uh formal response from US
 
04:52:10.670 --> 04:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor they don't deal deal
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
and hypotheticals uh but she did point
 
04:52:18.190 --> 04:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
out that if this were to create a system
 
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
where employers were not participating
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
in the State Unemployment Compensation
 
04:52:27.310 --> 04:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
Program and weren't paying their um um
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
contributions to support that program
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
that would disqualify them from being
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
able to take their discount against
 
04:52:39.670 --> 04:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
their federal unemployment tax liability
 
04:52:42.910 --> 04:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh so current ly if a state meets
 
04:52:46.750 --> 04:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements for how it runs its
 
04:52:49.788 --> 04:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
Unemployment Compensation Program and
 
04:52:51.868 --> 04:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
employers are in compliance with that
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
meaning that they're filing their
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
quarterly tax and wage reports they're
 
04:52:58.750 --> 04:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
paying the tax that is owed then those
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
employers get a 90% discount against
 
04:53:04.548 --> 04:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
their Federal Unemployment uh tax
 
04:53:07.868 --> 04:53:07.878 align:start position:0%
obligation so normally an employer would
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
be on the hook for 6% of the first
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
14,000 in annual earnings per employee
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
to the feds and with that um discount
 
04:53:22.510 --> 04:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
they pay 6% so the that saves New
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers about $200 million
 
04:53:28.030 --> 04:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
per year in federal unemployment tax
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
obligations because the state um runs a
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
program that meets all of those
 
04:53:37.470 --> 04:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
requirements so
 
04:53:41.070 --> 04:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a lot um
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
that I could say in response to the the
 
04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that was offered and into the
 
04:53:46.590 --> 04:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
some of the concepts here and some of
 
04:53:49.110 --> 04:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
the questions I'll try to address them
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost I don't think
 
04:53:52.510 --> 04:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to file for unemployment
 
04:53:54.830 --> 04:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
compensation I know I didn't um I
 
04:53:56.670 --> 04:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
certainly did not want that when my wife
 
04:53:58.830 --> 04:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
was out of work and my son was 3 months
 
04:54:02.310 --> 04:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
old um but I was sure uh pleased that I
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
qualified and I had that support uh
 
04:54:07.070 --> 04:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
during those next few months when I was
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
searching for employment during the
 
04:54:10.990 --> 04:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
Great pandemic uh during the a great uh
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
recession um the pandemic I probably
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
wish I was uh just with the amount of
 
04:54:19.548 --> 04:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
times you guys saw me um but it it's a
 
04:54:22.030 --> 04:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
it's a program that was put in place in
 
04:54:22.040 --> 04:54:22.910 align:start position:0%
it's a program that was put in place in
the

04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
1930s um there is uniformity across
 
04:54:29.830 --> 04:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
States and how it is implemented it's
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
not by accident um when it was initially
 
04:54:35.708 --> 04:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
being proposed uh by the federal
 
04:54:38.190 --> 04:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
government uh states were hesitant to
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
participate because they didn't want to
 
04:54:43.868 --> 04:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
put them eles at risk or in Jeopardy of
 
04:54:46.150 --> 04:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
losing Employers in their states who
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
would leave their state to go to another
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
state that didn't tax them for an
 
04:54:53.670 --> 04:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment program uh the FED solved
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
that problem um with what they would
 
04:54:58.030 --> 04:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
have described as a carrot I think they
 
04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
use the carrot somewhat like a stick um
 
04:55:03.310 --> 04:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
but it was simply that what I described
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
earlier um if Employers in the state are
 
04:55:09.628 --> 04:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
operating in a federally uh compliant
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
and conform forming program those
 
04:55:14.070 --> 04:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
employers get that 90% discount against
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
their federal unemployment tax
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
obligation um now there are a lot of
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
other types of wage replacement programs
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
that are out there um you have I Mr
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the scenario you were
 
04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
describing would be uh you know
 
04:55:32.350 --> 04:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
something akin to a Paid Family Leave
 
04:55:34.830 --> 04:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
program or short a short-term disability
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
program so um you have a qualifying
 
04:55:43.150 --> 04:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
event um you receive wage replacement
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
for the time that that event uh
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
continues and then you go back to work
 
04:55:51.310 --> 04:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
um there are other supplemental products
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
that are out there as well um you know
 
04:55:55.708 --> 04:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
lots of different providers that will
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
provide uh supplemental payments when
 
04:56:00.270 --> 04:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
you have a qualifying
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
event um now again the no one wants to
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
be unemployed um and the goal of the
 
04:56:10.310 --> 04:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment program is to end that un
 
04:56:14.708 --> 04:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
employment right we spend um our a lot
 
04:56:18.470 --> 04:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
of our time and effort on trying to make
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the connections are plentiful
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
between hiring employers and um
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
unemployed individuals so we try to uh
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
minimize that duration of unemployment
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't create any incentives
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh to stay on unemployment longer than
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
you need to right now that uh wage
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
replacement of your unemployment benefit
 
04:56:45.430 --> 04:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
being around 30% of what that average
 
04:56:48.030 --> 04:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
private sector worker was earning that
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
certainly gives you incentive to get
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
back to work because that is our goal
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
our goal is to um help individuals with
 
04:57:00.590 --> 04:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
a financial bridge to their next job so
 
04:57:03.390 --> 04:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
we do that without over
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
incentivizing um staying out of the
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
labor force wage replacement uh that is
 
04:57:12.548 --> 04:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
lower than what you were earning um but
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
enough to hopefully um allow you to
 
04:57:18.510 --> 04:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
continue to pay your bills and get to
 
04:57:24.030 --> 04:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
that next job so it's um
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
the concern that I would have and the
 
04:57:29.070 --> 04:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
department does not take a position on
 
04:57:32.270 --> 04:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
the bill I would be concerned with what
 
04:57:36.788 --> 04:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
was described and a creating a product
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
that would almost on its face incent I
 
04:57:43.708 --> 04:57:43.718 align:start position:0%
staying out of the labor force um our
 
04:57:46.750 --> 04:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
whole system is geared towards getting
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
you back to
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
employment making sure that each and
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
every week that you're filing for
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment that you are actively
 
04:57:57.670 --> 04:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
searching for work you're certifying
 
04:58:00.830 --> 04:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
that to the department it's not just a a
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
come in and apply and here's 26 weeks
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
worth of benefits um and good luck it is
 
04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
a constant um process with these
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
individuals to help them get back to
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
work because that is our goal so
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
anything that would be interpreted as
 
04:58:23.390 --> 04:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
creating an incentive for people to stay
 
04:58:26.430 --> 04:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
out of work longer than the labor market
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
dictates I would I would very much be
 
04:58:31.470 --> 04:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
concerned with that and what kind of
 
04:58:33.510 --> 04:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
message that would be
 
04:58:38.030 --> 04:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
sending um to my knowledge um uh right
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
now all states have a version of what
 
04:58:42.430 --> 04:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
employment security provides for New
 
04:58:45.390 --> 04:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there are different benefit
 
04:58:47.788 --> 04:58:47.798 align:start position:0%
amounts from state to state different
 
04:58:49.788 --> 04:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
number of weeks that you are eligible
 
04:58:52.590 --> 04:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
for from state to state but they all
 
04:58:55.230 --> 04:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
meet the basic requirements from the
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
federal government for having a uh
 
04:59:00.750 --> 04:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
complying and conforming system so that
 
04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
their employers can uh maintain that 90%
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
discount um against their federal tax
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
liability happy to answer any questions
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you so
 
04:59:12.320 --> 04:59:15.430 align:start position:0%
great thank you so
much

04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:59:20.230 --> 04:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question on a um a seasonal
 
04:59:23.070 --> 04:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
work profile would representative
 
04:59:25.470 --> 04:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
Granger's proposal hold a little bit
 
04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
more water meaning say I own a landscape
 
04:59:30.310 --> 04:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
company and we terminate on December 1st
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
we don't start up until April 1st that
 
04:59:36.150 --> 04:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
period of time in there say that
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
employee is only eligible to get that
 
04:59:40.708 --> 04:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
427 a week may not be enough to get him
 
04:59:42.990 --> 04:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
through he may look for other employment
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
in a different area that's 12 months but
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
if he could have that option to purchase
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
04:59:53.948 --> 04:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
seasonal um help if you will that may be
 
04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
you may be able to retain that employee
 
04:59:59.470 --> 04:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
and if it's a key employee especially um
 
05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
would you view it differently if if it
 
05:00:05.708 --> 05:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
was on a seasonal basis a fixed seasonal
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
basis um it's a good question I I
 
05:00:09.788 --> 05:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't view it any differently though
 
05:00:09.798 --> 05:00:11.190 align:start position:0%
wouldn't view it any differently though
um

05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
I talk with a lot of employers um all
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
across the state I you know I talk with
 
05:00:18.030 --> 05:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of seasonal employers and some of
 
05:00:19.948 --> 05:00:19.958 align:start position:0%
the best models that I find are those
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
seasonal employers who are able to um
 
05:00:24.390 --> 05:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
either have something else for that
 
05:00:25.948 --> 05:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
offseason or they partner up with
 
05:00:27.548 --> 05:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
someone else for that offseason whether
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
it be the landscaping company that has a
 
05:00:32.190 --> 05:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
relationship with the local fuel
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
delivery company so that there's going
 
05:00:36.948 --> 05:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
to be work for those individuals that
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
are able to um have you know hold a CDL
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
license and drive throughout the year
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
because we want employment during all of
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
those times now right now um New
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generally requires you to
 
05:00:53.230 --> 05:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
search for work when if you qualify for
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
unemployment however with a A change
 
05:00:59.868 --> 05:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
that was made just prior to the pandemic
 
05:01:03.868 --> 05:01:03.878 align:start position:0%
if you are um temporarily out of work um
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
and it's going to last um up to 11 weeks
 
05:01:11.548 --> 05:01:11.558 align:start position:0%
your work search is waved so it's not
 
05:01:14.590 --> 05:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
specific to any industry but it's really
 
05:01:18.070 --> 05:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
um uh something that was U implemented
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
for those that have uh seasonal
 
05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment where they aren't required
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
to search for work they get the the
 
05:01:28.590 --> 05:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
benefit to which they qualify for based
 
05:01:30.510 --> 05:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
upon the income that they had during
 
05:01:33.548 --> 05:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
their um prior four quarters but in
 
05:01:35.948 --> 05:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
those instances those individuals get a
 
05:01:38.548 --> 05:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
waiver of their work search uh because
 
05:01:41.910 --> 05:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
they are temporarily unemployed but for
 
05:01:43.548 --> 05:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
other people that are permanently laid
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
off um they have a work search
 
05:01:46.670 --> 05:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
requirement we're trying to get them
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
back to work uh right away um and again
 
05:01:54.750 --> 05:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
the fundamental design is that a the
 
05:01:57.390 --> 05:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
system needs to provide a level of wage
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
replacement that is going to be enough
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
to help carry you through to your next
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
job uh but not provide so much that it's
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
going to increase the duration of your
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment because the goal is to get
 
05:02:12.270 --> 05:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.830 --> 05:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr yes thank you Mr chair and
 
05:02:17.948 --> 05:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lers U would these people
 
05:02:20.990 --> 05:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
with The 11we Gap would would they be
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
people who have a reasonable Assurance
 
05:02:24.670 --> 05:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
of repur to that
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
job uh it's even a higher standard than
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
that they have to have essentially a
 
05:02:31.390 --> 05:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they are going to be
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
returning within that 11 weeks thank and
 
05:02:35.190 --> 05:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
that and that gets confirmed with the
 
05:02:37.868 --> 05:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
employer okay thank you very represent
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you uh thank you Mr Jim
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
um we talked a lot uh today about uh the
 
05:02:49.270 --> 05:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
wage end of it but during the past
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
couple of years through Co and other
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
things can you talk a little bit about
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
the benefit of having a
 
05:02:58.910 --> 05:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
system as it relates to supporting the
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
communities and stabilizing communities
 
05:03:04.110 --> 05:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
at the same time not only the workers
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
but the communities in which they live
 
05:03:07.350 --> 05:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the state in
 
05:03:09.868 --> 05:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
general uh yeah representa there there's
 
05:03:12.990 --> 05:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
a um enormous benefit to local
 
05:03:16.110 --> 05:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
communities and the uh the the existence
 
05:03:18.990 --> 05:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
of an unemployment program that provides
 
05:03:21.470 --> 05:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh assistance while someone is
 
05:03:24.430 --> 05:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
unemployed uh that's less Reliance upon
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
the local communities for General Aid uh
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
whether that be their welfare program or
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
other support programs that exist
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
locally um during the 18 months of the
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic um just to give a a sense of
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
the the scope of what uh
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
type of um economic infusion the
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment program can provide to the
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
state and also help save some of that
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
burden from being uh shifted onto the
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
local community when their their
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
residents go in and and seek assistance
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program paid $2 billion
 
05:04:03.390 --> 05:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
in benefits over an 18month period um to
 
05:04:03.400 --> 05:04:04.310 align:start position:0%
in benefits over an 18month period um to
about

05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
175,000 granted state workers uh so that
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
was assistance that was provided to them
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
that then allowed them not to need to go
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
to their local communities and seek
 
05:04:17.788 --> 05:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
other assistance um so there is there is
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
an impact on local communities um but
 
05:04:24.190 --> 05:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
again um we're just try we're trying to
 
05:04:27.270 --> 05:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
get people back to work that is the goal
 
05:04:31.030 --> 05:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is why we maintain a um such a
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
robust system of New Hampshire Works
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
offices where people can come in uh
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
receive uh free services search for jobs
 
05:04:43.070 --> 05:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
um if they're filing for unemployment we
 
05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
can provide assistance with that but
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
really to help them connect whether it
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
be large job fairs which the department
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
is the largest provider of job fairs in
 
05:04:55.230 --> 05:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
the state did 65 of them last year 6,800
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
job Seekers attended those 65 job fairs
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
or whether it be a local recruitment
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
event local employer wants to come in on
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
a Wednesday when we know we're going to
 
05:05:06.750 --> 05:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
have 20 people attending one of those um
 
05:05:09.390 --> 05:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
benefit rights sessions that we had I
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
Prov Ed you a pamphlet of earlier and
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
that employer wants to have that
 
05:05:15.628 --> 05:05:15.638 align:start position:0%
oneon-one to be able to hopefully maybe
 
05:05:18.548 --> 05:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
fill some of the um needs that they have
 
05:05:20.788 --> 05:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
or they're using our recruitment portals
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of tools in place uh to
 
05:05:25.948 --> 05:05:25.958 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that that duration of
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
unemployment is as short as it can
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
possibly be based upon the current
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
state represent King thank you Mr
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have a question for you
 
05:05:41.628 --> 05:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
regarding to you said before to us that
 
05:05:44.190 --> 05:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
the employer pays the unemployment
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
portion currently and that's how the
 
05:05:48.548 --> 05:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
fund is funded so you did say that there
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
are supplemental things that go above
 
05:05:52.750 --> 05:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
and beyond that such as like I outlined
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
before afflac and other services do
 
05:05:59.150 --> 05:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
those other services uh they supplement
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
but do they is there any circumstance
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
where unemployment can't be used when
 
05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
those services are paying out um so
 
05:06:08.110 --> 05:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great question just to clarify
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
those other supplemental servic
 
05:06:12.590 --> 05:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
the department has nothing to do with um
 
05:06:15.150 --> 05:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
presumably those are um if those are
 
05:06:16.830 --> 05:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
Insurance products they're registered
 
05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
and licensed with the Department of
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
Insurance but we have nothing to do with
 
05:06:21.990 --> 05:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
those however when you're when you're
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
filing for unemployment you are required
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
to report all of your work so New
 
05:06:28.270 --> 05:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire allows part-time work but
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
you're also you're required to report
 
05:06:34.030 --> 05:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
any in all income uh during that time
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
period so if it's earnings from uh your
 
05:06:38.470 --> 05:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
part-time employment you need to be
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
reporting that to us but if you get a um
 
05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
surprise late bonus or a uh paid time
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
off payout from your employer you need
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
to be reporting that to the department
 
05:06:53.708 --> 05:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
similar if you're getting any and a lot
 
05:06:56.750 --> 05:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
of uh other types of income uh because
 
05:06:58.590 --> 05:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
that may or may not impact your
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit um one other thing
 
05:07:03.590 --> 05:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
you your question made me um remember
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
something else that's important to to
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
mention um with regard to the um the the
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
the problems caused by unemployment you
 
05:07:14.350 --> 05:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
know in a lot of instances the
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit program isn't the
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
only game in town uh for an individual
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
worker who finds themselves unemployed
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own a lot of
 
05:07:25.628 --> 05:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
employers um also provide assistance in
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
those time periods whether that be with
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
some length of a severance or other
 
05:07:33.788 --> 05:07:33.798 align:start position:0%
types of payouts um to help those
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
individuals um get to that next job so
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
you see it's very common uh with an
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
employer to provide some length of a
 
05:07:43.868 --> 05:07:43.878 align:start position:0%
severance which you know is money being
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
paid to you while you're not working for
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
that employer um and um obviously if
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
there is a severance or any payment from
 
05:07:53.548 --> 05:07:53.558 align:start position:0%
the employer that gets coordinated with
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
your unemployment benefit but that's
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
another way that employers are already
 
05:08:01.070 --> 05:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
um trying to help their workers um guard
 
05:08:07.390 --> 05:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment representative kale
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
CH thank you Mr LS again so again with
 
05:08:15.030 --> 05:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
reporting income we're talking about
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
earned income whether it was uh a
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
saverage package that was earned
 
05:08:21.708 --> 05:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
vacation that was earned but not uh not
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
a lottery ticket that came in right or
 
05:08:27.670 --> 05:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
an inheritance or such uh unearned
 
05:08:30.270 --> 05:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
income correct um everything received
 
05:08:32.830 --> 05:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be reported um whether or not
 
05:08:34.270 --> 05:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that counts against your
 
05:08:36.548 --> 05:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit is determined by
 
05:08:42.960 --> 05:08:42.970 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.970 --> 05:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you again for being with us Mr
 
05:08:50.878 --> 05:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
thank you again for being with us Mr
labers

05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
labers
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
um the you mentioned earlier uh right
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
now the is 6% the first $14,000 which
 
05:09:04.670 --> 05:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
equates basically to 80 80 something
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
dollars per employee per year um in your
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
opinion is that a good deal for the
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
employers to have that kind of back stop
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
for their
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
employees um rather than me saying it it
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
is good or bad I can tell you I'll just
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
reiterate what I said earlier New
 
05:09:25.868 --> 05:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers have the lowest
 
05:09:28.548 --> 05:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax burden in the entire
 
05:09:31.470 --> 05:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
Northeast third lowest Third only only
 
05:09:34.030 --> 05:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
behind Florida and Mississippi in the
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
entire country New Hampshire employers
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
pay at about a third of what they're
 
05:09:42.830 --> 05:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
um their businesses to the south in
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts currently pay for their
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
unemployment program and that
 
05:09:52.510 --> 05:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
$85 per worker um if
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
someone uh loses their job files for
 
05:09:58.350 --> 05:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment they qualify for 427 which
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
is our current Max they collect for all
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
26 weeks they're getting a little over
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so for
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
$85 one of the lowest unemployment tax
 
05:10:10.708 --> 05:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
burdens in the country
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
um seems to be um working out well right
 
05:10:19.470 --> 05:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
business okay seeing no further
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
questions and having no um other pin
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
cards and uh people who want to testify
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%

05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and we have about five minutes
 
05:10:45.548 --> 05:10:45.558 align:start position:0%

we'll open the hearing on HB 225 uh the
 
05:17:56.350 --> 05:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor is also our chairman um so
 
05:17:59.548 --> 05:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
let's pay him a little bit of um respect
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
and have some fun with him thank you sir
 
05:18:04.430 --> 05:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
chair uh I'm here today to uh introduce
 
05:18:12.190 --> 05:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
house build 225 FN an act relative to
 
05:18:14.110 --> 05:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
the employment of military spouses in
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
the event of involuntary deployment of a
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
service member what this bill seeks to
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
do is to add a paragraph to RSA 110- C
 
05:18:27.510 --> 05:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
and basically that paragraph says that
 
05:18:31.548 --> 05:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
if a military member is
 
05:18:36.230 --> 05:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
deployed and the spouse determines that
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
they canot can no longer work for what
 
05:18:42.788 --> 05:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
ever reason that the company for which
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
the spouse Works would have to hold that
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
position now it's a company of over 50
 
05:18:50.070 --> 05:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
people so it's not it's not a very very
 
05:18:50.080 --> 05:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
people so it's not it's not a very very
small

05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
company where this hit home for me is
 
05:18:58.990 --> 05:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
that um when I
 
05:19:03.150 --> 05:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
deployed we had uh situations where
 
05:19:03.160 --> 05:19:04.868 align:start position:0%
deployed we had uh situations where
soldiers

05:19:04.868 --> 05:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
soldiers
 
05:19:08.310 --> 05:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
spouses uh could not run the household
 
05:19:11.030 --> 05:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
take care care of the kids do the job
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
and those other things that normally a
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
team effort would do and so they either
 
05:19:18.510 --> 05:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
went home or they stayed with their kids
 
05:19:20.590 --> 05:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
or whatever they did but it was just too
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
much for them to stay at home with the
 
05:19:23.280 --> 05:19:24.350 align:start position:0%
much for them to stay at home with the
spouse

05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
05:19:27.310 --> 05:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
deployed and so what this bill would do
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
it would say Hey listen um
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
employer uh if if your your employees
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
spouse deploys I just want you to hold
 
05:19:40.270 --> 05:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
that position open so there's no pay
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's no allowances there's no
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
compensation just when he comes back or
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
when she comes back uh just have a slot
 
05:19:53.470 --> 05:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
open for me and uh how many people a
 
05:19:56.590 --> 05:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
year I I wouldn't say it would be 10 but
 
05:19:59.788 --> 05:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day uh if the service
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
member is deploying and doing uh what he
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
or she is told to do then I think that
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
we as a state should say okay there's
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
certain amount of sacrifice here and uh
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
let's just hold that job open um and
 
05:20:16.548 --> 05:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
when you come back you're can have your
 
05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
job back that's all it's
 
05:20:22.670 --> 05:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
saying um and so just to be that simple
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.190 --> 05:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:20:30.510 --> 05:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh how long of a
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
period of time would this be indefinite
 
05:20:37.590 --> 05:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
like if that person was deployed for a
 
05:20:39.628 --> 05:20:39.638 align:start position:0%
great question no typic the typical
 
05:20:39.638 --> 05:20:42.030 align:start position:0%
great question no typic the typical
employ

05:20:42.030 --> 05:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
employ
 
05:20:46.150 --> 05:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
deployment has been up to a year but now
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's closer to nine months and I'll and
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
I'll allow the department to to validate
 
05:20:54.670 --> 05:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
that but I know my nephew just deployed
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
he was gone nine months so it's not
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
indefinite follow follow
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
up would the would the bill not that you
 
05:21:03.310 --> 05:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
want to amend it now but would you be
 
05:21:05.788 --> 05:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
able to write that in there to cap that
 
05:21:07.270 --> 05:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
in some capacity or is it already in
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
there and I I missed it
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
that deployment of one
 
05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
year uh just felt
 
05:21:17.708 --> 05:21:17.718 align:start position:0%
open-ended that that's a possibility
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I mean we could consider
 
05:21:23.230 --> 05:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
Dro thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:21:28.270 --> 05:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question I curious if any
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
thought was given uh a couple times a
 
05:21:33.030 --> 05:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
year we get bills about uh mandating
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
stuff for businesses or employers was
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
there any thought given to this as
 
05:21:39.628 --> 05:21:39.638 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh making it for you know
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
maybe 25 employees or more um because
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference between
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
mandating this for for an employer that
 
05:21:47.590 --> 05:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
has maybe one employee that has to hold
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
the spot open as opposed to a Walmart or
 
05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
Home Depot or something where they yeah
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
it just it says 50 in here it does if
 
05:21:58.070 --> 05:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
you look under paragraph 1A oh okay well
 
05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
then never mind employees 50 or more
 
05:22:03.750 --> 05:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay solivan good thank
 
05:22:03.760 --> 05:22:05.390 align:start position:0%
okay solivan good thank
you

05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned in your opening that um
 
05:22:13.788 --> 05:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
if the spouse is unable to work um is
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
that subject to some sort of qualifying
 
05:22:18.548 --> 05:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
factor or is it just assumed that if
 
05:22:21.788 --> 05:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
your spouse is if the soldier has been
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
sent um on deployment that it is assumed
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
that if the spouse wants to uh take the
 
05:22:29.910 --> 05:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
time off the spouse can yeah there
 
05:22:32.830 --> 05:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
there's no consideration to proving dire
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
need or or something of that nature
 
05:22:39.868 --> 05:22:39.878 align:start position:0%
follow follow um unrelated
 
05:22:41.910 --> 05:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
two um line one as I read through this
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
section confused me um says the employer
 
05:22:54.788 --> 05:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
May re-employ the
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
employe if the employer establishes that
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
its circumstances have so changed as to
 
05:23:02.548 --> 05:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
make re-employment impossible or
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
unreasonable as defined by the statute
 
05:23:06.798 --> 05:23:10.750 align:start position:0%
unreasonable as defined by the statute
um

05:23:10.750 --> 05:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that it it was
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
intended to say the employment the
 
05:23:25.150 --> 05:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:27.548 --> 05:23:27.558 align:start position:0%
re-employ I had that same thought when I
 
05:23:29.948 --> 05:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
first I'm sorry represent could you
 
05:23:32.548 --> 05:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
reference the on my I don't have the
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
line numbers on
 
05:23:37.150 --> 05:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
here the top of the page two I I hope
 
05:23:40.510 --> 05:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
you've got the same I've got P section
 
05:23:40.520 --> 05:23:41.590 align:start position:0%
you've got the same I've got P section
section

05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:23:58.590 --> 05:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
you so the employer May re-employ the
 
05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
employee if the employer establishes
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
that circumstances have so
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
changed or maybe what you're saying is
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
it should refused to it uses the word
 
05:24:15.548 --> 05:24:15.558 align:start position:0%
may which is which is permissive but it
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
still seems vague again it seems it was
 
05:24:21.430 --> 05:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
intended to say the employer may choose
 
05:24:22.868 --> 05:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
not to
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
re-employ yeah I think you're
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
right okay fair enough so amendment is
 
05:24:29.520 --> 05:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
right okay fair enough so amendment is
in

05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:24:34.350 --> 05:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
order okay thank
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:24:40.110 --> 05:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
McKenzie uh
 
05:24:42.670 --> 05:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about getting the job
 
05:24:44.150 --> 05:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
back are we talking about getting the
 
05:24:47.868 --> 05:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
job back that they came from and I think
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's a distinction that we may
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
want to build into this thing okay thank
 
05:24:53.280 --> 05:24:57.390 align:start position:0%
want to build into this thing okay thank
you

05:24:57.390 --> 05:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:59.230 --> 05:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
represent Mr
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you for taking
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
sure does the spouse qualify for
 
05:25:10.708 --> 05:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:13.030 --> 05:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
is that the intent I that's not my
 
05:25:15.510 --> 05:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
purview but the that is not the
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
intention the application of
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
unemployment was was not part of the
 
05:25:24.350 --> 05:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
discussion follow thank you Mr
 
05:25:26.868 --> 05:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
chairman um so basically this is
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
allowing the person to take the time off
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
for whatever reasons and then be able to
 
05:25:33.150 --> 05:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
get their job back when the
 
05:25:35.350 --> 05:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances changed either person
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
coming back that's pretty much all
 
05:25:38.030 --> 05:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do corre that's correct
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much representa
 
05:25:39.958 --> 05:25:41.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much representa
D

05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
D
 
05:25:44.190 --> 05:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
sylvestro and I'm sorry can I just
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
clarify that so that the the employer is
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
not firing laying off or letting go the
 
05:25:54.990 --> 05:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
employee the employee is initiating
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
taking a leave of absence if you will
 
05:25:58.548 --> 05:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
there you go so that that would not
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment repr D
 
05:26:06.390 --> 05:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
sylvestro you just used the word leave
 
05:26:09.430 --> 05:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
of absence um normally we don't want to
 
05:26:11.830 --> 05:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
interfere with businesses and how they
 
05:26:14.830 --> 05:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
um operate so we're asking a business to
 
05:26:17.110 --> 05:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
hold a seat and I and I understand the
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
purpose but that employer would have to
 
05:26:22.230 --> 05:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps get temporary people in so they
 
05:26:24.270 --> 05:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
need to cover that job as they're going
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
through I was just curious were you able
 
05:26:28.470 --> 05:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to any employers just run this
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
by anyone and and what was their answers
 
05:26:36.430 --> 05:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:39.868 --> 05:26:39.878 align:start position:0%
not representative kill
 
05:26:43.230 --> 05:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:26:45.670 --> 05:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
you sir uh I know you said that the
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
deployment had been a year or right now
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
running nine months correct but it's not
 
05:26:54.270 --> 05:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
out of out of the realm of possibility
 
05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
that circumstances could change and it
 
05:26:57.788 --> 05:26:57.798 align:start position:0%
could be for the
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
duration I I have no objection to to the
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
provision just the same but I mean it is
 
05:27:06.350 --> 05:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
a possibility that as my colleague
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
across the aisle here uh indicated the
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
employer would be able to have temporary
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
help it's just that when the soldier
 
05:27:17.230 --> 05:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
Returns the spouse would be would they
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
would find a position suitable position
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative Castle
 
05:27:24.750 --> 05:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
ring thank you Mr chair thank you for

taking my question so have you done any
 
05:27:28.910 --> 05:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
research if any other states do this or
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
anything along that line since this is
 
05:27:31.948 --> 05:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
more of a state I'll leave that for for
 
05:27:36.190 --> 05:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.190 --> 05:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
05:27:45.708 --> 05:27:45.718 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have one final
 
05:27:50.270 --> 05:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
question um what would the spouse be
 
05:27:54.070 --> 05:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
afforded if anything by the armed
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
services is there anything that that
 
05:27:58.270 --> 05:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
they would get I me there's there's a
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
whole Litany of Services
 
05:28:04.910 --> 05:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
benefits um different programs that the
 
05:28:07.270 --> 05:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
guard runs to take care of deployed
 
05:28:11.150 --> 05:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously you got commissary
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
benefits you got PX benefit um you know
 
05:28:18.390 --> 05:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
shopping benefits you've got all your
 
05:28:21.190 --> 05:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
medical is covered okay is is there rent
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
and such that would coverage and help
 
05:28:25.230 --> 05:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
for that morgage I leave that to the
 
05:28:26.430 --> 05:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
department but I'm pretty sure if
 
05:28:28.548 --> 05:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
they're activated then they get a
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
housing allowance okay but I I I would
 
05:28:34.948 --> 05:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
leave that to them okay very good
 
05:28:36.868 --> 05:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
because we normally as active duty you
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
are you already get housing allowance
 
05:28:40.788 --> 05:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
the National Guard doesn't necessarily
 
05:28:42.750 --> 05:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
get a housing Alliance but if you
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
activate the National Guard under title
 
05:28:49.548 --> 05:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
10 then you qualify for for active
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and so th those would then
 
05:28:57.510 --> 05:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
apply represent McKenzie uh based on the
 
05:28:59.868 --> 05:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard earlier uh is it's
 
05:29:01.708 --> 05:29:01.718 align:start position:0%
your understanding that to be eligible
 
05:29:03.390 --> 05:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
for unemployment you need to be
 
05:29:06.590 --> 05:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
available to work you have to be you
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
have to file you have to do work all
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
those searches so that this would in
 
05:29:12.910 --> 05:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
terms of that would they be eligible for
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
benefits is your understanding they
 
05:29:15.990 --> 05:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
would not be that's correct result of
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
05:29:20.670 --> 05:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
correct K thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh do I understand that this is
 
05:29:26.190 --> 05:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
limited to the guard and not active duty
 
05:29:28.830 --> 05:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel like a scenario where the
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
soldier is is deployed overseas for an
 
05:29:35.310 --> 05:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
extended period and the spouse wants to
 
05:29:37.708 --> 05:29:37.718 align:start position:0%
go you know along and help take care of
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
the children children and would a job be
 
05:29:43.430 --> 05:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
awaiting upon their return yeah so this
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
is the the specific um reference is to
 
05:29:49.390 --> 05:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
military service members and that's
 
05:29:54.390 --> 05:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
Guard Reserve and active Okay thank
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
you any further questions
 
05:29:57.840 --> 05:29:59.628 align:start position:0%
you any further questions
for

05:29:59.628 --> 05:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I just have a couple Mr
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
chairman if that's of course um it does
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
make reference to a couple of federal
 
05:30:09.030 --> 05:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
sections um
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
especially section
 
05:30:15.150 --> 05:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
seven um I'm unfamiliar with that um I I
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
think the department will probably speak
 
05:30:18.310 --> 05:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
to that as to how that's going to be
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
worked in because we Department of Labor
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
usually doesn't enforce um particular
 
05:30:25.390 --> 05:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations when it comes to
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
protections for employees uh what was
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
your what was your thought on that just
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
to bring that definition forward into
 
05:30:34.150 --> 05:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill so so the I mean the thought
 
05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
is that under title 10 you're
 
05:30:40.750 --> 05:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
federalized and so you deploy you deploy
 
05:30:46.470 --> 05:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
as a part of a federal M
 
05:30:49.830 --> 05:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
action not a state action so the Guard
 
05:30:54.070 --> 05:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
works for the governor until title 10 is
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
implemented when that service member
 
05:31:00.990 --> 05:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
then becomes a federal deploy and the
 
05:31:03.150 --> 05:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
still under the guard but he's
 
05:31:05.510 --> 05:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
federalized thank you um that that's the
 
05:31:07.510 --> 05:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
connection yep I noticed that we had uh
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
we had a uh save the guard Bill last
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
year and there was questions about
 
05:31:14.788 --> 05:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
deployments that were not I don't want
 
05:31:16.590 --> 05:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
to say sanctioned but not federally
 
05:31:19.510 --> 05:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
authorized um would this cover um all of
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
the branches of employment of the
 
05:31:24.510 --> 05:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
government for armed services or just
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
for the national guard for the state no
 
05:31:29.830 --> 05:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's they would cover active reserve
 
05:31:31.470 --> 05:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
and guard those are the three you have
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
three components active Garden reserve
 
05:31:40.470 --> 05:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:42.190 --> 05:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
mobilization that's all I have for right
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
now Mr chairman awesome thank you any
 
05:31:46.470 --> 05:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:31:51.430 --> 05:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
you we have Kevin
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:06.030 --> 05:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record l Gentlemen of
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Kevin Grady uh
 
05:32:13.070 --> 05:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
I am a 25y year Air Force veteran and
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm a 27y year veteran of the the town
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
of hooks at New Hampshire and today I'm
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
here representing the state veterans
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
advisory committee we're uh since I
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't see this committee all that often
 
05:32:27.270 --> 05:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you um I want to tell
 
05:32:29.910 --> 05:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
you what we do we're um we're chartered
 
05:32:34.470 --> 05:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
by state RSA 115 colon a-8 if you want
 
05:32:36.910 --> 05:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
to look us up and we're we have 20
 
05:32:39.708 --> 05:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
members of our group which are from
 
05:32:42.430 --> 05:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
State veteran service organizations and
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
these names would be familiar to you
 
05:32:46.670 --> 05:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
like the American Legion or the VFW and
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
I personally represent the Aaron space
 
05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
forces Association on the committee and
 
05:32:52.830 --> 05:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
I'm their legislative chair and one of
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
the things that I do is I go through and
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
look at all of the bills coming before
 
05:32:58.590 --> 05:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
the state house and I figure out which
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
ones have better an impact and we
 
05:33:01.948 --> 05:33:01.958 align:start position:0%
discuss those bills at one of our
 
05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
meetings and we take a position on them
 
05:33:04.750 --> 05:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
and then I come and tell you what that
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
position is um a a lot of times I'm in
 
05:33:11.030 --> 05:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
the position and today is one of them
 
05:33:14.470 --> 05:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
where the nuts and bolts of how this is
 
05:33:16.708 --> 05:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
going to work are best left to people
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
that are a lot smarter about things like
 
05:33:20.430 --> 05:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
this than I am and that the members of
 
05:33:23.390 --> 05:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
my committee uh are we support
 
05:33:25.788 --> 05:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
conceptionally this idea of trying to
 
05:33:27.788 --> 05:33:27.798 align:start position:0%
help out a military spouse wherever we
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
can a lot of people don't realize that
 
05:33:32.590 --> 05:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
that if we have a guard member for
 
05:33:35.310 --> 05:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
example that deploys and let's take a a
 
05:33:38.548 --> 05:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
fairly lucrative career field like an IT
 
05:33:40.070 --> 05:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
manager at some
 
05:33:43.470 --> 05:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
place and that person deploys for for 6
 
05:33:46.590 --> 05:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
months and their Air Force rank is say
 
05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
an E4 or an E5 you know that person has
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
taken a massive deduction in salary to
 
05:33:54.990 --> 05:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
to deploy on that thing because they're
 
05:33:56.830 --> 05:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
now getting paid just like they were in
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
the active Force as an E5 or E4 living
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you'll get some housing
 
05:34:05.470 --> 05:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
allowance credits and stuff like that
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
but still the base pay is going to be
 
05:34:09.470 --> 05:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
Rel it's going to be the same as what an
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
E5 or an E4 makes somewhere else so they
 
05:34:14.270 --> 05:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
they're making big sacrifices to do this
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I could certainly see a situation
 
05:34:19.750 --> 05:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
where a spouse would go I I can't afford
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
on the money that he's now making I
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
can't afford child care or I can't
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
afford those kind of things and
 
05:34:27.230 --> 05:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
therefore you know I may need to to to
 
05:34:29.150 --> 05:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
go home and live with my parents you
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
know for for this this the four to six
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
months that this person is deployed but
 
05:34:34.670 --> 05:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
one day we're going to come back and I
 
05:34:36.190 --> 05:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
would sure love to have my job back when
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
and we do so I can certainly see what a
 
05:34:42.070 --> 05:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
situation like this would happen um this
 
05:34:44.070 --> 05:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually a priority type
 
05:34:47.070 --> 05:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
bill for an office in Washington DC
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
called the defense State liaison office
 
05:34:50.670 --> 05:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
we actually have three of them we're
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
tracking this time the others are
 
05:34:55.868 --> 05:34:55.878 align:start position:0%
hp64 which adds military spouses to uh
 
05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
hiring preference legislation and hp62
 
05:35:01.670 --> 05:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
on protection of violence uh with
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
military protective orders and other
 
05:35:04.910 --> 05:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
things and there's they set 10
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
priorities for the year and they're all
 
05:35:07.200 --> 05:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
priorities for the year and they're all
designed

05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
designed
 
05:35:10.350 --> 05:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
to basically make sure that we're
 
05:35:11.830 --> 05:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
helping out the military families
 
05:35:13.948 --> 05:35:13.958 align:start position:0%
wherever we can because theyve found
 
05:35:15.548 --> 05:35:15.558 align:start position:0%
that in a competitive environment like
 
05:35:17.948 --> 05:35:17.958 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves in today you know it's
 
05:35:20.110 --> 05:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
much it's very important to have you
 
05:35:22.670 --> 05:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
know a strong family uh supporting you
 
05:35:24.190 --> 05:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
when you make that decision to whether
 
05:35:25.470 --> 05:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stay in or I'm going to go
 
05:35:27.390 --> 05:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
work for the private sector or I'm going
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
to stay in the guard or I'm going to
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
going to leave the guard so we want to
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
want to keep these people as best we can
 
05:35:35.628 --> 05:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
and and and supporting our families is
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
is important the last thing that I want
 
05:35:39.628 --> 05:35:39.638 align:start position:0%
to leave you with is that every time I
 
05:35:41.190 --> 05:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
talk to a committee I always tell them
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
that when one of us serves the whole
 
05:35:45.990 --> 05:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
family serves so that a lot our families
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sacrifices so we can do
 
05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
what we do and so we do support this
 
05:35:52.788 --> 05:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
legislation and again the nuts and bolts
 
05:35:55.628 --> 05:35:55.638 align:start position:0%
of you know the wording and stuff is is
 
05:35:57.390 --> 05:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
is best left to people that that do that
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
better than we
 
05:36:00.628 --> 05:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
do so subject to your question sir
 
05:36:01.830 --> 05:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's really all I wanted to
 
05:36:02.788 --> 05:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
tell you today thanks for the
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to interview our committee
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to do a bill that
 
05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
has veteran impact we're a resource that
 
05:36:10.190 --> 05:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
you can use to help get the language the
 
05:36:11.948 --> 05:36:11.958 align:start position:0%
way you want it and so that we're not
 
05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
having to amend it next year or the year
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
after because there were things that we
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
didn't see in it well thank you for
 
05:36:20.230 --> 05:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
being here before us I I I haven't seen
 
05:36:22.670 --> 05:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
you before yes sir I I have seen a lot
 
05:36:25.030 --> 05:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
of people in this room before I want to

uh

05:36:31.708 --> 05:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.750 --> 05:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
gentlemen representative Hall thank you
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
question am I understanding you
 
05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
correctly that a soldier deployed into a
 
05:36:44.548 --> 05:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
battle space is taking a cut and pay is
 
05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
that could certainly be if that person
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
is a is a is a National Guard
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
employee uh and you know they were they
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
were they were making six figures a year
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
in their job as an IT person and now
 
05:36:59.310 --> 05:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
they're making 45 or $50,000 so not from
 
05:37:00.990 --> 05:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
the military but they're giving up their
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
Civ job they're not making that that
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
civilian paycheck that they were making
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
because they've they've been activated
 
05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
under title 10 and deployed and now
 
05:37:09.708 --> 05:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
they're they're essentially part of the
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
active duty
 
05:37:13.590 --> 05:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
Force so that would that would not be a
 
05:37:15.548 --> 05:37:15.558 align:start position:0%
active duty sorry follow yes that would
 
05:37:17.948 --> 05:37:17.958 align:start position:0%
be a guard member only that's in that
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
position if you're going to get deployed
 
05:37:20.590 --> 05:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
to a combat zone you're going to be on
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
active duty and whether you start out as
 
05:37:24.910 --> 05:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
an active duty member like we have an
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
active duty squadron at at P right now
 
05:37:31.470 --> 05:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
okay about 130 or something uh Colonel
 
05:37:33.788 --> 05:37:33.798 align:start position:0%
Bix will know better than me active duty
 
05:37:35.788 --> 05:37:35.798 align:start position:0%
folks that are flying our tankers right
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
alongside of our our guard folks and
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're on active duty as as we speak
 
05:37:42.030 --> 05:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
but the folks that are having civilian
 
05:37:43.590 --> 05:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
jobs and they're working a standard
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
guard one weekend a month two weeks in a
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
year those folks could be looking at a
 
05:37:51.070 --> 05:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
substantial pay cut in order to deploy
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh and support our country understood
 
05:37:53.200 --> 05:37:54.270 align:start position:0%
uh and support our country understood
thank

05:37:54.270 --> 05:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:37:57.430 --> 05:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh more of a statement than a
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
question yes sir um my daughter owns a
 
05:38:10.230 --> 05:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
preschool and it's like like $300 a week
 
05:38:13.030 --> 05:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
for preschool the applicability in this
 
05:38:17.788 --> 05:38:17.798 align:start position:0%
bill might be that if the spouse if
 
05:38:20.190 --> 05:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
they're making less money the spouse
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
then has less disposable income to put
 
05:38:24.110 --> 05:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
their three kids into preschool which
 
05:38:27.390 --> 05:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
could be $1,000 a week and she's
 
05:38:30.310 --> 05:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
basically or he's basically now doing
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
that job so there there's a there's a
 
05:38:34.350 --> 05:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
concept there that I just want to share
 
05:38:35.990 --> 05:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the members might have been more
 
05:38:38.270 --> 05:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
applicable for executive sessions but I
 
05:38:41.110 --> 05:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
see the applicability in this yes
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
sir any forur other
 
05:38:46.350 --> 05:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you sir I

05:38:51.628 --> 05:38:51.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%

135s um while I was on you know with the
 
05:40:32.468 --> 05:40:32.478 align:start position:0%
military at uh at Peas I deployed on
 
05:40:36.670 --> 05:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
many many missions I I deployed um from
 
05:40:36.680 --> 05:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
many many missions I I deployed um from
operation

05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
operation
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
Desert Shield while I was active duty
 
05:40:42.670 --> 05:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
Desert Storm to all the way through
 
05:40:46.030 --> 05:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
operation Iraqi freedom and uh en
 
05:40:49.948 --> 05:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
enduring freedom and while I was uh
 
05:40:51.750 --> 05:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
while I was with the National Guard we
 
05:40:55.230 --> 05:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
took care of my husband's mother who had
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's and I deployed during that
 
05:41:00.390 --> 05:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
time and I'm telling you it was very
 
05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
difficult um that's a different you know
 
05:41:06.070 --> 05:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
we really my husband did not choose to
 
05:41:08.910 --> 05:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
leave his job nor did he want to we
 
05:41:11.350 --> 05:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
ended up getting extra care extra
 
05:41:13.830 --> 05:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things that you know are
 
05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
happening with our families when they
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
deploy so it could be family issues it
 
05:41:22.548 --> 05:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
could be children that need extra help
 
05:41:25.110 --> 05:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
um in the case of what generated this
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill we had a gentleman who
 
05:41:32.230 --> 05:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
deployed um for a year and this was in
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
2021 his they have five children now
 
05:41:38.190 --> 05:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
they had four children then and and she
 
05:41:40.750 --> 05:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
asked they had a lot of extenuating
 
05:41:43.350 --> 05:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
circum circumstances with the children
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
and she asked her employer to T to take
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
a leave of absence for the year while he
 
05:41:50.510 --> 05:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
was gone and they said no and so she
 
05:41:53.430 --> 05:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
made do as most of our military spouses
 
05:41:55.830 --> 05:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
do they make do with what they have they
 
05:41:59.110 --> 05:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
get extra care elsewhere they you know
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
they can call on the Squadron or the
 
05:42:03.430 --> 05:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
commander or their their outfit and and
 
05:42:05.548 --> 05:42:05.558 align:start position:0%
get help from our family services
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's we have a lot of ways of getting
 
05:42:10.110 --> 05:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
help so to answer that question from
 
05:42:13.030 --> 05:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
before we do have a lot of services that
 
05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
we provide to our spouses but in this
 
05:42:18.110 --> 05:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
case it would have really helped her to
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
be able to take a leave of absence from
 
05:42:24.030 --> 05:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
her job so that she could care for her
 
05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
family um she had a mother-in-law who
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
was who eventually she died of covid
 
05:42:32.910 --> 05:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
complications and that was during this
 
05:42:35.230 --> 05:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
time period so there were a lot of
 
05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances in her case um
 
05:42:42.670 --> 05:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
and and I and I just want to kind of um
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
get to some of the questions out there
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
how many people would this affect I
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that it would affect a lot
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
of our spouses I don't think that
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
spouses are you know you're your
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
military member is going to deploy I've
 
05:42:58.190 --> 05:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
deployed many times I don't think I ever
 
05:43:00.628 --> 05:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
heard my husband say once that he wanted
 
05:43:04.030 --> 05:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
to leave his job that was him not all
 
05:43:06.310 --> 05:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
spouses are the same but there you know
 
05:43:08.310 --> 05:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know too many military spouses
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
that are going to say I'm going to take
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
a leave of absence for one full year but
 
05:43:14.590 --> 05:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
we have more and more complications with
 
05:43:18.670 --> 05:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
family and um situations that come along
 
05:43:20.830 --> 05:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
that it might it might affect so it
 
05:43:24.070 --> 05:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
would it would help the few maybe the
 
05:43:26.430 --> 05:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
Dozen who would take advantage of this
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
type of thing and to get to the employer
 
05:43:28.798 --> 05:43:29.468 align:start position:0%
type of thing and to get to the employer
you

05:43:29.468 --> 05:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:43:32.430 --> 05:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
know I suppose it would be an extra cost
 
05:43:35.548 --> 05:43:35.558 align:start position:0%
they would have to um you know hire
 
05:43:39.150 --> 05:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
somebody a a sub or you know aemp person
 
05:43:42.750 --> 05:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
for a while um so we do understand that
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
that would be a cost but we feel that it
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be a minimal cost to the employer
 
05:43:49.430 --> 05:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't affect that many the
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
way that we have you know written the
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
05:43:54.160 --> 05:43:56.230 align:start position:0%
bill and
uh

05:43:56.230 --> 05:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time I'll take
 
05:43:58.558 --> 05:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time I'll take
your

05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%

thank you for your service thank you
representative

05:44:06.030 --> 05:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
Warden thank you and thanks for your
 
05:44:10.350 --> 05:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
testimony today you cited a specific
 
05:44:13.390 --> 05:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
example of a family you said four
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
children one on the way and she needed
 
05:44:17.390 --> 05:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
to be home with the family correct
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
correct do you recall the what employer
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
that was that she had at the
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
time I do not know the employer
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
um follow up so it was before my time at
 
05:44:32.110 --> 05:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
as the deputy agitant General so um I
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
could get that information for you if
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
you wanted question of that is was was
 
05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
that employer
 
05:44:41.150 --> 05:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
employing more than 50 people yes or was
 
05:44:47.310 --> 05:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.468 --> 05:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
McKenzie this is a u this is a question
 
05:44:51.478 --> 05:44:53.110 align:start position:0%
McKenzie this is a u this is a question
uh

05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:55.868 --> 05:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
regarding whether or not employers
 
05:44:59.310 --> 05:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people who present
 
05:45:01.868 --> 05:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
themselves as active members uh in the
 
05:45:03.990 --> 05:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
guard and whether or not that would be a
 
05:45:06.430 --> 05:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
disincentive for employers to hire
 
05:45:06.440 --> 05:45:07.990 align:start position:0%
disincentive for employers to hire
somebody

05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:45:10.510 --> 05:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
which would be I think would be a
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
disservice in so many ways but I'm
 
05:45:14.788 --> 05:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
curious if you've ever bumped up against
 
05:45:17.990 --> 05:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we have a program called employer
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
support of the gard and reserve and they
 
05:45:22.948 --> 05:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
are there to handle those types of
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
problems with our employers so they're
 
05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
um they are made up of uh mostly retired
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen who go out and meet with
 
05:45:35.708 --> 05:45:35.718 align:start position:0%
employers and they have activities with
 
05:45:39.430 --> 05:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
the you know they have with employers to
 
05:45:42.468 --> 05:45:42.478 align:start position:0%
um to educate them on the needs of
 
05:45:44.548 --> 05:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen but I would say that most
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
employers are are are extremely
 
05:45:48.868 --> 05:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
supportive of and even in this case that
 
05:45:51.430 --> 05:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
I gave you with uh the gentleman the
 
05:45:54.390 --> 05:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
soldier who deployed and his wife she's
 
05:45:57.910 --> 05:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
she according to what I know from that
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
situation she has said before that her
 
05:46:02.750 --> 05:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
employer has bent over backwards in
 
05:46:05.310 --> 05:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
other cases it they couldn't manage it
 
05:46:07.070 --> 05:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
then and I know it was during the the
 
05:46:09.708 --> 05:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
covid period it was a difficult period
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
for everybody on all so maybe there were
 
05:46:14.350 --> 05:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances that way as
 
05:46:17.910 --> 05:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
well but I would say that mostly um we
 
05:46:20.190 --> 05:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
encounter employers that are very
 
05:46:23.910 --> 05:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
supportive of and they like the energy
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
and you know our Guardsmen are do
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
several things at one time you know we
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
had a pilot at peas who was also a
 
05:46:33.468 --> 05:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
president of a financial company in
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
Boston so in that in the case that Kevin
 
05:46:39.548 --> 05:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
Wasing talking about um yes every time
 
05:46:42.430 --> 05:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
he deployed he he was making less money
 
05:46:45.468 --> 05:46:45.478 align:start position:0%
than he did as a civilian so but he did
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
it because he loved it and he he wanted
 
05:46:50.350 --> 05:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
to serve his country and you know and
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
his wife was very supportive so you know
 
05:46:56.190 --> 05:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
we we make things work one followup
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
question follow did you say at the
 
05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
beginning of this that you would just
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%

05:47:15.468 --> 05:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
I still have an active license um but I

support uh the spouses or anything like
 
05:47:49.548 --> 05:47:49.558 align:start position:0%

05:47:50.590 --> 05:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%

Deputy Commissioner with the Department
 
05:48:49.160 --> 05:48:50.350 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner with the Department
of

05:48:50.350 --> 05:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:48:53.150 --> 05:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
Labor uh very briefly we have reviewed
 
05:48:55.948 --> 05:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
the bill um and we feel that we can
 
05:48:57.590 --> 05:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
enforce and administer the provisions of
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
the bill with no no issue um one minor
 
05:49:03.548 --> 05:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
technical note on the wording of the
 
05:49:06.030 --> 05:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
bill um we put this in our fiscal note
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
in section
 
05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
8B it references the second sentence of
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
that section that uh a court may also
 
05:49:16.628 --> 05:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
award the employee reasonable attorney's
 
05:49:18.750 --> 05:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
fees and costs um there's no other
 
05:49:21.628 --> 05:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
reference to a court procedure within
 
05:49:24.548 --> 05:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
the bill as written we would assume that
 
05:49:26.868 --> 05:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
um it was intended that uh any award of
 
05:49:28.430 --> 05:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees or cost would come out of
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
the Department's administrative hearing
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
procedure so just a technical note there
 
05:49:34.190 --> 05:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
but other than that I'm happy to take
 
05:49:36.830 --> 05:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
questions um to hopefully provide you
 
05:49:39.070 --> 05:49:39.080 align:start position:0%

05:49:42.510 --> 05:49:42.520 align:start position:0%

05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
keep that data that would be a better
 
05:50:02.070 --> 05:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
question for the Department of
 
05:50:02.080 --> 05:50:04.230 align:start position:0%
question for the Department of
Employment

05:50:04.230 --> 05:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
Employment
 
05:50:07.390 --> 05:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
Security follow up follow up thank
 
05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
you and you mentioned the reference
 
05:50:13.190 --> 05:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
section 8B the court may also award the
 
05:50:14.868 --> 05:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
employee reasonable attorneys fees is
 
05:50:14.878 --> 05:50:16.190 align:start position:0%
employee reasonable attorneys fees is
that

05:50:16.190 --> 05:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
common language and other types of
 
05:50:21.750 --> 05:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
violations of this nature for against
 
05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
employers uh it's similar to um the
 
05:50:29.788 --> 05:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
language that exists now in RSA U 110c
 
05:50:31.548 --> 05:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to employ protections for
 
05:50:34.590 --> 05:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
members of the National Guard um there
 
05:50:37.230 --> 05:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
are similar language there that
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
statute as it pertains to the current
 
05:50:42.670 --> 05:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
service members has a more um more
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
detailed process by which there's a
 
05:50:47.310 --> 05:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
mediation uh then the Department of
 
05:50:49.590 --> 05:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
Labor is involved if and then if the
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um needs assistance
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
enforcing the end result it can go to
 
05:50:55.750 --> 05:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office if the
 
05:50:57.910 --> 05:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office uh it can
 
05:50:59.468 --> 05:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
proceed in Superior Court if the
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office declines to
 
05:51:02.750 --> 05:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
proceed in Superior Court the service
 
05:51:03.990 --> 05:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
member themselves can proceed in
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and then the court May
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
award um attorneys fees and costs as
 
05:51:11.070 --> 05:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
well as as other Equitable relief so um
 
05:51:13.390 --> 05:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
that line also appears in there um this
 
05:51:14.670 --> 05:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
bill is written seems to only
 
05:51:17.590 --> 05:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
contemplate a uh administrative
 
05:51:20.750 --> 05:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding um so it just if it's going
 
05:51:22.628 --> 05:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
to have an administrative proceeding we
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
would just want to make sure that that's
 
05:51:25.070 --> 05:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
all all lined up if there's going to be
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
a core proceeding then those details
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:32.670 --> 05:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would this be a
 
05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
on a violation would this be a warning
 
05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
first type situation because of the
 
05:51:41.468 --> 05:51:41.478 align:start position:0%
obscurity of this and and how it's kind
 
05:51:43.708 --> 05:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
of buried in the weeds most employers
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
may not know this that's an excellent
 
05:51:50.830 --> 05:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
question um as it's written right now uh
 
05:51:52.030 --> 05:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this bill would
 
05:51:54.830 --> 05:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
only allow for um the Equitable relief
 
05:51:56.430 --> 05:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
that's included in it would not fall
 
05:51:59.628 --> 05:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
under the typical purview of the other
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
uh labor laws that have the more um the
 
05:52:04.390 --> 05:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
structure of warnings and then um and
 
05:52:07.868 --> 05:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
then F so there's no fine provision here
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh it would allow the department to
 
05:52:12.548 --> 05:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
order somebody to be um reinstated and
 
05:52:14.468 --> 05:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
Order back pay and other benefits lost
 
05:52:15.788 --> 05:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
so it would be fall out of the typical
 
05:52:20.030 --> 05:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
procedure represent
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
chairman on that same note about repeat
 
05:52:30.310 --> 05:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
offense and so forth I don't think I'd
 
05:52:32.030 --> 05:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
want to be a business in which they
 
05:52:34.590 --> 05:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
repeatedly offended this law about
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
spouses of militaries that are being
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
deployed I think it would be the worst
 
05:52:40.948 --> 05:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
thing they could ever have from a Public
 
05:52:44.430 --> 05:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
Relation standpoint again maybe
 
05:52:46.628 --> 05:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
something for executive session was that
 
05:52:48.590 --> 05:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
a question representative Flanigan if
 
05:52:48.600 --> 05:52:50.830 align:start position:0%
a question representative Flanigan if
you

05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
agree I I I never encourage any business
 
05:52:57.788 --> 05:52:57.798 align:start position:0%
to break any New Hampshire
 
05:53:01.750 --> 05:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
law representative wardon thank you to
 
05:53:03.708 --> 05:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
your knowledge is there any current
 
05:53:06.628 --> 05:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
statute or rule that prohibits a company
 
05:53:06.638 --> 05:53:07.750 align:start position:0%
statute or rule that prohibits a company
from

05:53:07.750 --> 05:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:53:11.070 --> 05:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
extending uh leave of absence to an
 
05:53:13.788 --> 05:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
employee for whatever reason let's say
 
05:53:15.990 --> 05:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
for weeks or months without paying that
 
05:53:18.350 --> 05:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
person so a different
 
05:53:21.150 --> 05:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
way can companies already do this
 
05:53:24.030 --> 05:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
voluntarily or would that be against
 
05:53:26.190 --> 05:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
statute uh to the Department's knowledge
 
05:53:27.788 --> 05:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
there's no statute that prohibit such a
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
thing that would fall to a company by
 
05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:37.718 --> 05:53:38.868 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:41.350 --> 05:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair uh thanks for
 
05:53:44.990 --> 05:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um reading through
 
05:53:45.000 --> 05:53:46.548 align:start position:0%
taking my question um reading through
Section

05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
Section
 
05:53:51.150 --> 05:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
8 it strikes me that it may not be until
 
05:53:54.430 --> 05:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
after the deployed spouse returns from
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
Duty that you could claim there's a
 
05:53:59.948 --> 05:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
violation of this is that how you would
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
interpret that at the
 
05:54:04.910 --> 05:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
do so the bill is written would um allow
 
05:54:06.390 --> 05:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
employees who believe they have been
 
05:54:09.150 --> 05:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
subjected to a violation um to file a
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
complaint within 180 days of the alleged
 
05:54:15.150 --> 05:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
violation um there's no provision here
 
05:54:17.070 --> 05:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
that would set a specific timetable for
 
05:54:20.830 --> 05:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
when a hearing would have to be held um
 
05:54:23.708 --> 05:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
typically hearings uh that are filed or
 
05:54:24.868 --> 05:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
sorry I should say petitions for
 
05:54:27.030 --> 05:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
hearings that are filed tend to be
 
05:54:29.628 --> 05:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
scheduled within two to three months
 
05:54:31.230 --> 05:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of hearing some
 
05:54:34.150 --> 05:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
have to be faster logistically so um it
 
05:54:36.430 --> 05:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
could very well be that it happens after
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
fact and perhaps reinstatement or back
 
05:54:40.390 --> 05:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
payer are kind of a retroactive thing at
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
that point uh followup Mr chair please
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
um my question is more along the lines
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
of there's no if I'm unless I'm missing
 
05:54:52.030 --> 05:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
it there's no provision in the bill for
 
05:54:54.830 --> 05:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
the employer to give an
 
05:54:57.310 --> 05:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
affirmative response to the employee
 
05:54:59.110 --> 05:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
saying yes you definitely will have your
 
05:54:59.120 --> 05:55:00.270 align:start position:0%
saying yes you definitely will have your
job

05:55:00.270 --> 05:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:55:25.310 --> 05:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:28.190 --> 05:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
I I don't see that language yeah all
 
05:55:31.750 --> 05:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
right so so so do you agree that that is
 
05:55:34.030 --> 05:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
language that would need to be added
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
potentially to remove that
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
confusion yeah the department will take
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
a policy position on whether that
 
05:55:41.310 --> 05:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
language should be in there or not I
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
will agree that fair I don't see the
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
words there yeah I I'll leave that to
 
05:55:48.390 --> 05:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the policy experts thank you just
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
just for clarification were you speaking
 
05:55:52.788 --> 05:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
of section seven that we had some
 
05:55:56.548 --> 05:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
question on the language May employ May
 
05:55:58.548 --> 05:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
re-employ is that what you looking at
 
05:56:01.990 --> 05:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
instead of no the question was
 
05:56:02.000 --> 05:56:03.548 align:start position:0%
instead of no the question was
more

05:56:03.548 --> 05:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:56:06.510 --> 05:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
that it seems the employee who feels
 
05:56:08.270 --> 05:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
they've been subjected to a violation of
 
05:56:13.868 --> 05:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
this statue can't may not have standing
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
to to state that until their spouse
 
05:56:20.548 --> 05:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
returns from mobilization and they go to
 
05:56:22.750 --> 05:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
ask for their job
 
05:56:25.310 --> 05:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
back well it's a
 
05:56:28.468 --> 05:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
combination um so the they believe
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
they've been subjected to a violation is
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
two but
 
05:56:41.230 --> 05:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
how do they know they've
 
05:56:43.430 --> 05:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
been they've been subjected to a
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
violation until their spouse returns and
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
they go ask for their job back because
 
05:56:52.390 --> 05:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the in the section in
 
05:56:56.590 --> 05:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
section two that requires the employer
 
05:56:59.910 --> 05:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
to give them something in writing that
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
they'll get their job
 
05:57:05.750 --> 05:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
back right that and that's my point is
 
05:57:07.708 --> 05:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
they if
 
05:57:11.468 --> 05:57:11.478 align:start position:0%
the deployed until the deployed spouse
 
05:57:11.478 --> 05:57:12.548 align:start position:0%
the deployed until the deployed spouse
comes

05:57:12.548 --> 05:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
comes
 
05:57:17.150 --> 05:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
back they can't ask for their job back
 
05:57:20.910 --> 05:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
which means they can't have the employer
 
05:57:24.030 --> 05:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
can't have violated the statute until
 
05:57:24.040 --> 05:57:25.708 align:start position:0%
can't have violated the statute until
that

05:57:25.708 --> 05:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
happens so I'm gon gonna try and
 
05:57:31.788 --> 05:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
summarize uh that so if the non-employee
 
05:57:34.110 --> 05:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
was deployed and the employee wants to
 
05:57:36.430 --> 05:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
take a leave and then come back before
 
05:57:38.510 --> 05:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
the deployment is
 
05:57:43.350 --> 05:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
over no my question is just can the
 
05:57:45.310 --> 05:57:45.320 align:start position:0%
employer can the
 
05:57:50.310 --> 05:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
employee bring an action against the
 
05:57:53.390 --> 05:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
employer immediately when the employer
 
05:57:56.110 --> 05:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
says you I'm not keeping your job open
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
for you or do they have to wait until
 
05:58:02.830 --> 05:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
the deployed spouse returns in order to
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
make that determination that's a little
 
05:58:04.680 --> 05:58:06.868 align:start position:0%
make that determination that's a little
clearer

05:58:06.868 --> 05:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
so um under the proposed language under
 
05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
section two
 
05:58:13.468 --> 05:58:13.478 align:start position:0%
um I think it covers kind of a broader
 
05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
range of potential things that could
 
05:58:17.070 --> 05:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
happen in that employer employee
 
05:58:18.948 --> 05:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
relationship it says that an employer
 
05:58:21.510 --> 05:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
shall not discharge refuse to hire or
 
05:58:23.708 --> 05:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
take any adverse employment action
 
05:58:25.350 --> 05:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
against an employee based on the
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
involuntary mobilization so it's likely
 
05:58:30.590 --> 05:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
there could be actions that could be
 
05:58:32.628 --> 05:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
brought um at any time during the
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
mobilization or afterwards depending on
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
what happen seems like it's trying to
 
05:58:40.070 --> 05:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
capture a broader cross-section of
 
05:58:40.080 --> 05:58:44.270 align:start position:0%
capture a broader cross-section of
employment

05:58:44.270 --> 05:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:48.150 --> 05:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
situations representative kill Mr chair
 
05:58:52.628 --> 05:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh Mr garan would it be uh practical and
 
05:58:56.190 --> 05:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
feasible for us to put something u in
 
05:58:58.788 --> 05:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
section five stating after the um
 
05:59:01.230 --> 05:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
employer is notified that they shall
 
05:59:05.230 --> 05:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
respond uh to let to advise the employee
 
05:59:08.990 --> 05:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not the Le will be granted
 
05:59:12.190 --> 05:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
and and then of course they return in
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
section six that's when they return and
 
05:59:15.788 --> 05:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
you know from the mobilization and seek
 
05:59:18.150 --> 05:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
their job back and I think they would
 
05:59:20.030 --> 05:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
know going in whether or not it's going
 
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
to be approved it has
 
05:59:23.240 --> 05:59:24.750 align:start position:0%
to be approved it has
approved

05:59:24.750 --> 05:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:59:24.760 --> 05:59:26.390 align:start position:0%
approved
yeah

05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:59:29.868 --> 05:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah the department won't take a
 
05:59:32.190 --> 05:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
position on on how best to fit that in
 
05:59:34.190 --> 05:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
as a as a policy I think there are a lot
 
05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
of considerations that could be play in
 
05:59:38.510 --> 05:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:59:38.520 --> 05:59:41.390 align:start position:0%
in that
interplay

05:59:41.390 --> 05:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
interplay
 
05:59:44.510 --> 05:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair from a violation
 
05:59:47.230 --> 05:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
perspective from the Department if this
 
05:59:50.708 --> 05:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
business is sold or bought out then how
 
05:59:53.708 --> 05:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:57.830 --> 05:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
forward that's an excellent question
 
05:59:57.840 --> 05:59:59.788 align:start position:0%
forward that's an excellent question
um

05:59:59.788 --> 05:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
it it can be difficult um we certainly
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
have cases where the department is
 
06:00:08.270 --> 06:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
seeking civil penalties typically um
 
06:00:09.990 --> 06:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
against businesses that have sold or
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
been bought out sometimes um that
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
liability would will extend beyond um
 
06:00:17.468 --> 06:00:17.478 align:start position:0%
the time where they either file for
 
06:00:19.310 --> 06:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy or they close their doors
 
06:00:20.990 --> 06:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
there are there are there's a winding up
 
06:00:23.190 --> 06:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
period where Claims can be brought
 
06:00:25.468 --> 06:00:25.478 align:start position:0%
sometimes the department is is chasing
 
06:00:27.150 --> 06:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
um companies through bankruptcy or
 
06:00:28.590 --> 06:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
through through auctions we have an
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
ability to um to lean when it comes to
 
06:00:33.150 --> 06:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
civil penalties here in terms of
 
06:00:35.310 --> 06:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
reinstating an employee to a job that
 
06:00:36.628 --> 06:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist because the business
 
06:00:38.110 --> 06:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist I think that would be that
 
06:00:40.830 --> 06:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to do um but it could
 
06:00:42.510 --> 06:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
be that the department has an ability
 
06:00:45.910 --> 06:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
under some of its existing um Provisions
 
06:00:48.628 --> 06:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
to seek um the back pay and some of the
 
06:00:51.150 --> 06:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
financial reimbursement restitution
 
06:00:53.628 --> 06:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
follow thank you Mr chair the reason I
 
06:00:56.190 --> 06:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
ask this is you may have businesses that
 
06:00:58.830 --> 06:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
have to disclose this upon tra you know
 
06:01:00.670 --> 06:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
selling from one entity to the other and
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
this could be a determining factor in
 
06:01:04.628 --> 06:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
whether that deal goes through or not so
 
06:01:06.110 --> 06:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
there would need to be complete compl
 
06:01:08.628 --> 06:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
Clarity in where this lies in order to
 
06:01:11.590 --> 06:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
make that transaction happen so I would
 
06:01:12.990 --> 06:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
think the department have to be real
 
06:01:15.910 --> 06:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
sharp on this just just a thought thank
 
06:01:17.430 --> 06:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
you yeah I think if any Clarity wanted
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
to be added to the bill on that ground I
 
06:01:21.750 --> 06:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
would leave that to the to the
 
06:01:23.390 --> 06:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislators to to determine what the
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
best policy wording is for
 
06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
that any further questions for Mr
 
06:01:32.750 --> 06:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
garrian or the department
 
06:01:36.310 --> 06:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
itself um I have a couple um definition
 
06:01:36.320 --> 06:01:42.070 align:start position:0%
itself um I have a couple um definition
of

06:01:42.070 --> 06:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.080 --> 06:01:43.788 align:start position:0%
 
spouse

06:01:43.788 --> 06:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
um what if they're not married and
 
06:01:48.510 --> 06:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're long-term Partners would there
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
still be some qualification issues or um
 
06:01:54.590 --> 06:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
because I know definition of spouse has
 
06:01:57.070 --> 06:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
changed through the years I think as
 
06:01:58.230 --> 06:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
written in the bill right now it's
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
legally married I think if the committee
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to revise that to include a
 
06:02:03.190 --> 06:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
broader range
 
06:02:06.270 --> 06:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
of uh Arrangements
 
06:02:08.190 --> 06:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
um that that's certainly a policy
 
06:02:11.230 --> 06:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
decision thank you um and along the
 
06:02:12.430 --> 06:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
lines of what everybody was talking
 
06:02:14.270 --> 06:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
about liable for
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
reinstatement um if the employer let's
 
06:02:18.190 --> 06:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
say you know they've been gone for a
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
year they've DED up their job between
 
06:02:21.070 --> 06:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
three different people and they come
 
06:02:24.468 --> 06:02:24.478 align:start position:0%
back for their job their job no longer
 
06:02:26.788 --> 06:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
exists technically no longer exists
 
06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
because of the changes they made in
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
order to cover that job would they be
 
06:02:32.350 --> 06:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
mandated to rehire that person in their
 
06:02:32.360 --> 06:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
mandated to rehire that person in their
original

06:02:33.430 --> 06:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
original
 
06:02:36.390 --> 06:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
capacity uh the bill provides for or or
 
06:02:37.948 --> 06:02:37.958 align:start position:0%
the application of what is a federal
 
06:02:39.468 --> 06:02:39.478 align:start position:0%
standard I admit I'm not familiar with
 
06:02:42.430 --> 06:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
that Federal standard
 
06:02:44.910 --> 06:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
um but it it there could be
 
06:02:46.708 --> 06:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances where
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps it seems that the bill is
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
intending that there are times where
 
06:02:51.310 --> 06:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
reinstatement is not possible and
 
06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
therefore employers are kind of relieved
 
06:02:55.070 --> 06:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
of this or perhaps there's a time when
 
06:02:57.390 --> 06:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
reinstatement is possible and um
 
06:02:58.590 --> 06:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
employers haven't met that I'm not
 
06:03:01.670 --> 06:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with that Federal standard um
 
06:03:04.868 --> 06:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
so that leads me to my next question yes
 
06:03:06.390 --> 06:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
um for that definition
 
06:03:09.628 --> 06:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
uh I know that a lot of our state laws
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes will conflict with certain
 
06:03:15.990 --> 06:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
federal stuff um would we need to add
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
that to our Protections in 275 for
 
06:03:21.548 --> 06:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
employees as well that type of
 
06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:28.878 --> 06:03:32.430 align:start position:0%
 
110

06:03:32.430 --> 06:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:34.910 --> 06:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
yep I want to make sure that if if
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
somebody comes to the de well saying
 
06:03:37.628 --> 06:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
okay well we're using this Federal
 
06:03:39.628 --> 06:03:39.638 align:start position:0%
standard but it's not in state law is
 
06:03:41.070 --> 06:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
the is the employer going to be able to
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
argue that well the state shouldn't be
 
06:03:44.468 --> 06:03:44.478 align:start position:0%
enforcing that it should be Federal and
 
06:03:47.590 --> 06:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
then our this is
 
06:03:50.590 --> 06:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
becomes that's an excellent question and
 
06:03:54.350 --> 06:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
I think it may involve uh a thorough and
 
06:03:57.510 --> 06:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
Nuance legal answer so I may uh if it's
 
06:03:59.390 --> 06:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay I may get back to you on that that
 
06:04:00.750 --> 06:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there's a lot to unpack
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
