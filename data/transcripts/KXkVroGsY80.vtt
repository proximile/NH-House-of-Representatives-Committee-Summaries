00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative nodder
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
who else do we have
 
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.329 align:start position:0%
who else do we have
preposition

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:16.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative uh Cole come and uh
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Smith will be um
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
here in a little while filling in
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so we're going to open up
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
with a work session on HB 15 which is
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
relative to the rate of the business
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
and and by the way I'll just make a
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
comment that um
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
as as many of you have noticed our exec
 
00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:51.019 align:start position:0%
session starts at 10 30 so we'll be
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
bouncing back and forth between after 10
 
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.550 align:start position:0%
bouncing back and forth between after 10
30

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
um once we finish a work session we'll
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
go into exact session executive and then
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
go on to the next bill so
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
um given that it's not 10 30 out if we
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
finish HP 15 before then we will
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
continue on the work session in
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
numerical order here of house bills and
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
then Senate bills so um did anyone have
 
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.069 align:start position:0%
then Senate bills so um did anyone have
any

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
all right yes
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
so this cuts the business Enterprise tax
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
from 0.55 to 0.5 and I'm always in favor
 
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.670 align:start position:0%
from 0.55 to 0.5 and I'm always in favor
of

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
reducing taxes where we can and still
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
meet Revenue requirements for the state
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
um that we already have a a speed up of
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax passed
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
into law through the hb2 and so I think
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
this is not ripe for prime time now and
 
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
be taken up in the next biennium
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
work session I don't have a gavel but um
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
close that close the work session on HP
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
15. it will come back and exec this
 
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
15. it will come back and exec this
later

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
all right I'm now going to open the work
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
session on hb60 camping fees for
 
00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:26.810 align:start position:0%
session on hb60 camping fees for
non-residents

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
non-residents
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
and do we have any
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
simple enough
 
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
I will open the work session on HP 100
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
which repeals the interest in dividends
 
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.790 align:start position:0%
which repeals the interest in dividends
tax

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:02.180 align:start position:0%
representative plett already in HP 2
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
Ergo this is uh
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time it's already
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
passed this might speed it up some but
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh from the from what's in hp2 but I
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
think what's in hp2 is enough for this
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
representative Ami
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to point it out that if
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
you would be
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a tax year and that
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
all right anything else
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none I close the
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
work session or HP 100.
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
we'll now open the work session on HP
 
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.150 align:start position:0%
we'll now open the work session on HP
121

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
121
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
relative to worldwide combined reporting
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
for unitary businesses
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
under the business profits tax
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd be glad to
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
give a report on behalf of the
 
00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:03.710 align:start position:0%
give a report on behalf of the
commission

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
um we've held a an organizational
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
meeting again with new membership on
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
August 15th
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
and I was selected to chair
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
and of course representative Schamberg
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
and representative ulery are on the
 
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.470 align:start position:0%
and representative ulery are on the
commission

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
eight of the 15
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
positions on the commission have been
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
filled as far as appointments and we're
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
simply proceeding with seven vacancies
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
because we do have a quorum and we've
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
had active participation from all of
 
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:37.700 align:start position:0%
those who have been appointed
 
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.289 align:start position:0%
those who have been appointed
we

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
we asked to meet several times during
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
the summer but we were denied permission
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
to do that only allowed an
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
organizational session
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we agreed at that meeting to meet
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
twice in September September 5th and
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
September 25th the September 5th turned
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
out to be very problematic lining up uh
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
presenters on the day following the
 
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.090 align:start position:0%
presenters on the day following the
holiday

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
and so after some back and forth we now
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
have a very full agenda set for next
 
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.289 align:start position:0%
have a very full agenda set for next
Monday

00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
the 25th
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
we we're going to start at 9 30 in the
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
morning run till probably three in the
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon we have five presenters in the
 
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
morning we'll take a break for lunch and
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
three more in the afternoon
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
these include in-state business
 
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:27.380 align:start position:0%
Advocates of the bill
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
includes representatives of
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
international multi multinational
 
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.220 align:start position:0%
businesses include academics include
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
experienced administrators from two
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I want to give credit to Gen 4 for
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
doing a terrific job backing me up and
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
lining up I think a very potent agenda
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
about half of them maybe a little more
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
will be in person
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
and the others will speak remotely
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
because this is an issue that we don't
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
have a lot of direct experience with in
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so those who are expert on
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
the subject are calling in or even
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
traveling from long distances
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
we've decided to stream it
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
and anybody who's got the time either
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
during or following I would encourage
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
you to at least pick and choose some
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
pieces and get a rough orientation it's
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
a complicated subject we have a deadline
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
of filing our report no later than
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
November 1st
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
at this point we anticipate just this
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
one very full day of testimony and we're
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
going to try to accelerate our report if
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
we can we'll know we'll we'll know that
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
better you know after the 25th so my
 
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:51.860 align:start position:0%
objective is that
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
the Ways and Means Committee defers this
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
until you can hear our report
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I would anticipate that we would act
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
on it this fall
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
so if we can get that report into you by
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
October 15th we'll certainly try and
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
we'll keep you posted
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative almie
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
thank you could I just ask a question
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
about that streaming on is
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
is there frequently the streaming the
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
person who is testifying or the person
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
who is calling in I don't know how
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to work is not audible to
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
those of us who can't come in person
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that question I've
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
asked the same question uh
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative army with that concern in
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
mind and I'm told that we shouldn't have
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
any difficulty with the audibility
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
combining the streaming and the remote
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
testimony we might have a little bit of
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
limitation when it comes to slides
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
people who are watching on the stream
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
may not be able to see those or read
 
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.970 align:start position:0%
may not be able to see those or read
them

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
so anyway these have been addressed and
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes this is a
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
non-jorn German comment if anybody ever
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
sees me grimacing it's got nothing to do
 
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:15.380 align:start position:0%
with anything said
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
and whatever party or any anything from
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
the audience I just went through my
 
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
second back surgery for spinal stenosis
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
the first one was successful I was
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
allergic to the stitches though so I had
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
to be opened up again so I'm not in
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
terrible pain but I feel a little so
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
forgive me if you see me making faces
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
that aren't appropriate
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything else to say
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%

uh reassured by representative
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
Spielberg's report I know it's been a
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
long time coming it's been a struggle
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
getting it going and it's an incredibly
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
complex subject matter and not without
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh different points of view so I welcome
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%

comments yes representative
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
this comment that when the wife uh Fair
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
decision was initially heard uh several
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
years ago this committee uh as it was
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
then uh constituted had uh uh long and
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
pretty exhaustive hearings regarding
 
00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:33.049 align:start position:0%
pretty exhaustive hearings regarding
that

00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
um the uh the bill as presented was one
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the methodologies considered by the
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee but after uh intense input by
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
the uh Attorney General's office uh a
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
different bill was eventually passed out
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
of this body and eventually passed by
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the entire house
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
affirmed by the Senate and signed by the

governor to uh set up a methodology to
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
predict uh individuals there are some
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
really really
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
complex Interstate constitutional issues
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%

um this this type of legislation
um

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
period at this point
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative almi
 
00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:24.049 align:start position:0%
thank you representative almi
yes

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I've got something of an update on
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
that from the National Council on State
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
Legislature and and state and local
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
taxation meetings I went through the I'm
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to get people this report somehow
 
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.669 align:start position:0%
going to get people this report somehow
soon

00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
um but on the
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of the United States
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
when it decided for the 45 states that
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
have sales taxes on
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
on in both the opposing on
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
on write-ups and the the decision itself
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
on recommended but did not require on
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
on specific mitigations to the Wayfair
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
situation which we're always already
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
being done by the test case that they
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
use South Dakota
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
um that is that
 
00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:24.409 align:start position:0%
um that is that
you

00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
you have to have sent
 
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.390 align:start position:0%
you have to have sent
um

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
I can't remember now but a a fairly
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
large for a small business
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.529 align:start position:0%
amount of
um

00:25:38.529 --> 00:25:38.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
of product into any state in order for
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
that state to be able to come in and say
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
you have to pay us the sales tax on it
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
and they put in also which was worrying
 
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.110 align:start position:0%
and they put in also which was worrying
that

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
you might
 
00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
um you might you'd be able to do that if
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
you'd had 200 transactions for that
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
state if you were selling cheap earrings
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
on the internet you could easily get
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
more than 200 with nothing near I think
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred thousand the amount of
 
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.149 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred thousand the amount of
money

00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:21.710 align:start position:0%
money
so

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
and California actually requires five
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand in recognition of the
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
fact it's a very big state but
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
on this was just made as a
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation a number of the states
 
00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:39.539 align:start position:0%
were already doing that almost all of
 
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:43.340 align:start position:0%
the states have now moved to go to those
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
recommended levels
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
on including the
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and and the I think all but two of
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
the states that are left are in the
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
process of doing so
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh the problem with those two is that
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
they have in their constitutions that
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
every single locality is allowed to set
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
and that the state can't tell them what
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
to do about it
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
so that's Colorado and Louisiana
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.210 align:start position:0%
on the
but

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we've discovered
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
over the years because the bill that we
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
put in was a trap for anybody that was
 
00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:35.870 align:start position:0%
put in was a trap for anybody that was
going

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
on going below those levels oh and a
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
number of the states have already gotten
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
rid of the 200 transactions as well
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
because they've all decided it's useless
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.669 align:start position:0%
um but the
the ones

00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:58.610 align:start position:0%
the the
um

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.409 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:27:59.409 --> 00:27:59.419 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
businesses over a hundred thousand at
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
least most of them would be in the
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
category of large businesses for most of
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
these States California still might be a
 
00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:13.490 align:start position:0%
these States California still might be a
problem

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
um but the Attorney General's office
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
on has control of a trap which is that
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
they look uh every every now and then
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
they look at um
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
at business organizations to to tell
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
them whether the any of the businesses
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
have complained about this yet
 
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.330 align:start position:0%
have complained about this yet
and

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
so far there really haven't been any
 
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
complaints but in the process also
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
they've learned that a lot of the bigger
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
businesses had already before Wayfair
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
been paying the sales taxes to other
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
states because they decided it would
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
cost less than litigating it
 
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
so we're we're in a kind of equilibrium
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
situation now
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
on which could change as we get further
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
away from federal stimulus and such but
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
that we do have a track bill for
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
and what that trap does is it says okay
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
if somebody comes in and is insisting
 
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
that the guy that
 
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.130 align:start position:0%
that the guy that
um

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
sold to bed one bed in Colorado or
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
New Jersey for uh
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
for 88 000 dollars
 
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
one of the people from The Craft sphere
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh and he got
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
a uh notice from them that he had to pay
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
the sales tax on that afterwards which
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
would mean that he would have to take it
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
out of his own pocket because he
 
00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:57.860 align:start position:0%
couldn't go back to the buyer
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
then the Attorney General's office can
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
look at that decide whether it's worth
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
going to the Supreme Court to fight to
 
00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:09.070 align:start position:0%
going to the Supreme Court to fight to
get

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
the conditions in that the Supreme Court
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
so so that's
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
um pretty much where we are on that and
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
I talked to
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
I am now cooperating on other things
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
with the person who was the head of the
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
streamlined sales tax fight that Norm
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
major and I were doing for
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.769 --> 00:30:47.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none will close the work session
 
00:30:59.529 --> 00:30:59.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
all right we'll now open the work
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
session on HP 192 relative to the rate
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
and exemptions of the interest and
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
The Spill would reinstitute the interest
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax any comments from
 
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.529 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax any comments from
anybody

00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
I kind of figured you might want to make
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
a comment representative almi that's
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
pretty much your bill
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.490 align:start position:0%
um this bill
is

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
is the the interest in dividends to X
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
will be repealed on the 1st of January
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
and would have to be reinstated
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
I am bringing in a bill to do that
 
00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:48.350 align:start position:0%
I am bringing in a bill to do that
so

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.010 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
that one is in drafting right now
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
because when we get to fy25
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
where there are a lot of things that
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
have been done to our taxes in the last
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
six years
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
that can cause us extreme trouble even
 
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a recession
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
but we are losing the
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
um subsidies we've been getting out of
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
the federal government at just about all
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
levels of our economy
 
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.730 align:start position:0%
levels of our economy
so

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
that's just what I wanted to say all
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
right thank you anyone any other
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
comments on HP 192
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
saying none will close the work session
 
00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
we'll open the work session on HP 220.
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure of charitable
 
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure of charitable
gaming

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh I'm the prime sponsor of
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
that Bill maybe the only sponsor and um
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
I believe it's uh the need for it is
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
superseded has been superseded by the
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
establishment of a commission that's
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
addressing the changes in charitable
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
gaming laws in recent years
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
um which is just getting going
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
um and has a year to work so
 
00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
um I'm hopeful that we will do good work
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime this bill is not
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I closed the work
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
we'll now open the work session on HB
 
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.029 align:start position:0%
we'll now open the work session on HB
450.

00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
450.
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
relative to removing the net operating
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
loss deduction limit on taxable income
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
under the business profits tax and on
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:56.630 align:start position:0%
this one
um

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
dra has proposed or has helped us
 
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.450 align:start position:0%
dra has proposed or has helped us
propose

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
propose
 
00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:05.539 align:start position:0%
three possible amendments to this bill
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
handling it in in different ways looking
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
at the right now we have a 10-year limit
 
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
on how long deductions can be taken
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
looking at changing that to
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
to something longer looking at the 10
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
million limit we currently have on the
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
net operating loss looking to make that
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
larger and also looking to I believe
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
right now there's an 80 limit
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
on how much can be deducted looking at
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
changing that so there's three
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
amendments and um
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
I would ask that uh Keen Wong if you can
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
from dra if you can come up here and
 
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
tell us about the three amendments
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
you all should have a copy of these
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
three amendments on your desk
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
they are for HP 450 we have uh
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
and um just to give some context we will
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
approach to uh provide some other
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
options uh for the nol deductions uh one
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
of the option was to maintain what was
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
in HB 450 but of course uh with the uh
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
incorporating uh all the previous work
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
the non-corps to also uh enjoy the uh
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
the repeal of the 80
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
um limitation and the other options uh
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
was to one of the one of the other
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
options was to remove the uh to extend
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
the 10-year carryover of the nol
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
deduction to a 20-year carryover and
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me interrupt you for a second if
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
we could talk about the specific
 
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.569 align:start position:0%
we could talk about the specific
Amendment

00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:25.130 align:start position:0%
Amendment
um

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:27.500 align:start position:0%
so that if we start with for example
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
2272 h
 
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:31.619 align:start position:0%
describe that just so that people
 
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:33.140 align:start position:0%
understand which
 
00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you take my three I got
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll just go in numerical order
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
starting with 2272
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
so amendment 2272h is essentially
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
similar to the original HP 450 other
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
than on line 26 which is where we uh
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
edit the additional Amendment there to
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
allow the non-corps to be treated the
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
same as C crops
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
so the the biggest
 
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.370 align:start position:0%
so the the biggest
um

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
original Amendment or the biggest piece
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
of this bill is in the original
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is on lines seven
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
through nine which is uh they're
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
eliminating the um
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
the limitation that's
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
available on the current
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
um Internal Revenue code that is
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
so right now the the we believe
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the Internal Revenue code is what 80
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
right now but that's is that going to be
 
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
changing the engine are able to code
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
that that the uh that the BPT is
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
following is as of December 31st of
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
2018. and that is has that limitation of
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
that um 80 percent
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
with this um original HP 450 removes
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
that uh that limitation of the 80
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
and line 26 allows the uh
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
the removal of the limitation to be
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
applied to also the non-corps
 
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.210 align:start position:0%
applied to also the non-corps
okay

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you yes representative
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little confused and I hope I'm
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
looking at a series of
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
typos so starting on line 13
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:55.940 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not a typo that's
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
that representative that is the original
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
text on the RSA the amendments to the
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
original text are in bold and in italics
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
on on this amendment we'll move on to
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
um Mr King if I understand this
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
correctly you're now treating
 
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.430 align:start position:0%
correctly you're now treating
um

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
subseas and llc's the same
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
so on the
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
yes that's essentially what's happening
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
with the the new the new language with
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
the language in here yeah correct all
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Platt I did not hear
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Wong
 
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
um what the impact of this is
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
financially is it possible to determine
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes uh when this bill was introduced
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
back in the previous session a fiscal
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
and um so that was distributed in with
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
the previous HP 450 when it was done uh
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
for for when it was prepared it was a
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
million dollars or 1.3 million dollars
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
reduction in um in Revenue in fiscal
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
year 23 a 5.1 million dollar reduction
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
in Revenue in fiscay 24 and fiscal year
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
25 onwards it's a six million dollar uh
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
reduction in Revenue
 
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:46.910 align:start position:0%
reduction in Revenue
um

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
potentially these these uh fiscal impact
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
could potentially be more of a timing
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
concern as opposed to a permanent
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
difference depending on how businesses
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
perform they may make potentially in
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
future Years be able to still claim the
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
net operating loss deductions that's
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
been limited to the 80 percent
 
00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:12.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you but but this was just for the
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
C Corps
 
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh if we add the llc's
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
I believe this calculation was on the
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
total the population of the uh
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
the BPT population that we have
 
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:44.450 align:start position:0%
the BPT population that we have
right

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.250 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
yes that calculation was based on the
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
total BPT population that we took the uh
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we've probably I think when we did
 
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
the the Cal Vision back then we made the
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
assumption that it was intended for the
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
entire population and not limited to
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
just C Corps yeah
 
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.210 align:start position:0%
just C Corps yeah
foreign

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions on this
 
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.970 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions on this
amendment

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none let's move on to
 
00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:20.349 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none let's move on to
um

00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:20.359 --> 00:42:22.089 align:start position:0%
um
amendments

00:42:22.089 --> 00:42:22.099 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
amendment 2273h is an amendment to
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
extend the uh availability to carry over
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
the nol deduction from a 10 years to 20
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
years right now the current uh
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute is limiting the
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
nol carryovers to only 10 years and then
 
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
this one allows it to carry over to 20
 
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.790 align:start position:0%
this one allows it to carry over to 20
years

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh the the IRC of 2018 which is the uh
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
the tax code that we follow for the BPT
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
does not have a limitation on the uh on
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
could you show tell us where the
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
differences between
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
450 is introduced and and on 73h sure
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
the 73 HD amendment is on line 14.
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:34.940 align:start position:0%
so essentially what we did with the uh
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
2273 H is we use the original language
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
as as is right now without the 80
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
limitation oh I mean without the removal
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
of the 80 limitation and just uh update
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
that for the 20 years carryover
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
so this is all based on the original S
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
as is currently uh the statute as is
 
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.170 align:start position:0%
as is currently uh the statute as is
current

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh oh I'm sorry you follow
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah do we is there a reason why we
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
have to keep
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
sub a through e
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
after well EES but the a to d it's only
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
age after it's been done not necessarily
 
00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:22.940 align:start position:0%
it's probably mostly for
 
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
historical references
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
other times we don't yes representative
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
Platt do you see a practical impact of
 
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
this if you have a net operating loss
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
for tax purposes going Beyond 10 years
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
up to 20 is that a viable business
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
that was one of the questions that was
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
discussed uh when we were approached uh
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
with this uh potential Amendment and um
 
00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.690 align:start position:0%
with this uh potential Amendment and um
it's

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say
 
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.890 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say
yeah

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative yes on
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
only a occurs when you have a large
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
business that has sub businesses that
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
they acquired in order to have a loss
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
that they could take off their taxes
 
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.349 align:start position:0%
that they could take off their taxes
yeah

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
and the question that I haven't thought
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
through is what this does to that but
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
also my question is does is
 
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.250 align:start position:0%
also my question is does is
are

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
a to d affected by changing it to 20
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative could you
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
repeat the question please yeah what
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
we've got now is that we've changed 10
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
to 20 in line 14. and from line 15 to 22
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's saying the amount of loss generated
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
in tax for
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
year maybe that may be carried forward
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
may not exceed 1 million some of my
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are lawyers may have
 
00:46:22.329 --> 00:46:22.339 align:start position:0%
figured this out already
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and and then on Eve we changed change it
 
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.589 align:start position:0%
and and then on Eve we changed change it
um

00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:42.740 align:start position:0%
if they were obeying in from 2003 to
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
2005 and up until
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
2012 on the earlier 10-year level
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
would they
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
have more loss that they can bring to us
 
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.790 align:start position:0%
have more loss that they can bring to us
now

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.450 align:start position:0%
now
retroactively

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
that is these companies that
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
have a loss leader among their products
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
there so potentially potentially yes but
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
then with the prior years let's say it's
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
having a look at
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
um D so that carry forward amount is
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
limited to one million dollars
 
00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
limited to one million dollars
um

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
so it was 10 it was 10 years
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
after July 1 20 2005 probably
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
um you know July
 
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.230 align:start position:0%
um you know July
2025.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.250 align:start position:0%
2025.
um

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
it could be a nominal impact
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
with a with a one million dollar on a
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
but if they actually had twenty thousand
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars of net operating loss
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
I mean the fact that we're not
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
well I'm just wondering the fact that we
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
are not using the word retroactive here
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm reading this as
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
um if you're like on the on the ninth
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
year or the 10th year and this this goes
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
to 20 it means that you can just keep
 
00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:29.099 align:start position:0%
you can keep going I don't really see
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
where this would be retroactive
 
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.930 align:start position:0%
where this would be retroactive
yes

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair yeah I would
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
agree I don't think it's retroactive
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
number one number two I think this would
 
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
allow us to maybe Draw Bigger business
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
and help our tax base and help our state
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh just based on the fact that if a
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
business wanted to come in and start up
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
it would cover it would be able to cover
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
its losses if there were any as it goes
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
forward and grows and becomes
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
established so to me it looks like a
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
good Amendment thank you
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative elmik we have an awful
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
lot of research out there that says that
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
taxes are somewhere around the 9th or
 
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
10th consideration of large corporations
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
we did have a um
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh I don't remember it was a report or a
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
comment from I believe the tax
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
Foundation saying that um
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ranks as one of the worst
 
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:38.579 align:start position:0%
in the nol
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
um area net operating loss our policy in
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
that regard so that that is something
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
that I would think they look at but um
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
any other any other comments
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury thank you Mr
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
chairman I just would like to
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
confirm we will revisit this bill and
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
there will be an opportunity to discuss
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
specifics on another occasion this fall
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct because if so I'm going
 
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
to withhold my comments till then
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
that would be the plan and let's um
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
after a hearing from
 
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.430 align:start position:0%
after a hearing from
um

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Wong people feel okay we're on top of
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
this we want to move forward
 
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.190 align:start position:0%
this we want to move forward
um

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
but if that's um so
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know how do people feel in
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
general right now feel like they're
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
going to need more time to digest these
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
or we could potentially
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
could move forward when we go into exec
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
session and and choose
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
one or more of these
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I I feel that we this is just uh
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
coming to us and that uh it is
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
complicated and that
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
um we all should take time to digest it
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
and then have a discussion that's
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
informed by a little time to think and
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that's what I recommend and I hope
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
we'll do it that way okay representative
 
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
spilsbury yeah yes I agree and just to
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
confirm exactly what I was trying to
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
apply I would
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
look forward to another work session on
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
this bill okay
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative doors uh I also concur
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I also concur with
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives Ames comments and I
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
would like to ask representative all me
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
to submit to us those 10
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're listed 10 things that businesses
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
are looking at I would love to see that
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
that's going to require a lot of work
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
my information is you can I I can can
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
call a colleague and ask him yeah all
 
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.569 align:start position:0%
call a colleague and ask him yeah all
right

00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
um all right any other any other
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on 2273
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none let's move on to
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
the last Amendment which is 2274 h
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
and so for the last Amendment oh yes
 
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
before I continue although the area
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
helped to prepare these amendments I
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate that oh I want
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
to mention that dra does not have a
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
position on any of these bills okay
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so for uh Amendment 2274 H the
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
amendment here is to remove that that
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
limitation of 10 million dollars from
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
the nol deduction carryover
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
and that amendment is online 25 through
 
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:35.210 align:start position:0%
and that amendment is online 25 through
27.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
representative plant just a practical
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
question do we have businesses with
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
anything else representative Schoenberg
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as being the
 
00:53:04.089 --> 00:53:04.099 align:start position:0%
original sponsor of the first nol
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
two years ago uh I feel that what
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative janigan has done is a uh
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
a positive
 
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.710 align:start position:0%
a positive
overall

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
there are cyclical Industries and
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
non-cyclical and I think that we need to
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
being able to help them also the
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
especially the cyclical Industries
 
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.829 align:start position:0%
especially the cyclical Industries
and

00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:36.530 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
when I first proposed my nol it it only
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
wanted to change that 80 percent
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
but I think that this ends up being a
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
better bill with your
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
amendments unless we have stronger
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
discussion later on when we meet that
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
would maybe change my mind
 
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.470 align:start position:0%
would maybe change my mind
um

00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
we are trying to provide an Optimum Tax
 
00:54:03.049 --> 00:54:03.059 align:start position:0%
climate for this state and I think this
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
bill will add to that in the long run
 
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
but we need to discuss as representative
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
balmy brought up you know the a through
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
the D portions of this just to make sure
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
that we are not stepping on a landmine
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
with the retroactive so uh I do like
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
your approach to this
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
sorry could we get on
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
a rough fiscal note on each of these
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative we did try to perform a
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
calculation on on these amendments
 
00:54:48.359 --> 00:54:49.490 align:start position:0%
calculation on on these amendments
however

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
um the data that we have is restricting
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
us to actually perform any kind of
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:02.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
question yeah uh representative Ames
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
I was just looking at my notes on this
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
bill when we
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
heard it uh initially and at that time
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
I think uh the if it was we were told
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
that there was a report by the federal
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
Congressional committee that had worked
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
on the at the federal level on this nol
 
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:31.940 align:start position:0%
issue regarding the 80 percent
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
limitation and the indefinite carry
 
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
forward question and I had asked at that
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
time if we might get a copy of that King
 
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:42.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
you could look again see if there is
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
such a thing and if so either give us a
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
link or
 
00:55:59.450 --> 00:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
yes representative ulery
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
just I'll ask a question when you
 
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:12.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh could we ask dra if we can get an
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
the 277s that are listed A4 uh
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
13 and a120 just so just
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
so we have in the back of our mind how
 
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
these match in with this
 
00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:38.210 align:start position:0%
these match in with this
just

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
briefly because you're making a
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
reference to another section of law
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
section 172.
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
of uh the Internal Revenue code but that
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
that changes so
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
just I if I remember correctly 77 a120
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
says we're going to follow the code to a
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
date sir
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
that but then what is 172 just just as a
 
00:57:10.859 --> 00:57:12.650 align:start position:0%
that but then what is 172 just just as a
memory

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
memory
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
device yep representative Laurie that's
 
00:57:20.049 --> 00:57:20.059 align:start position:0%
correct all right RC 77-a1 Roman 20
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
states which Internal Revenue code that
 
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
the BBT would become in compliant with
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
for any particular tax year and section
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
172 that is the Internal Revenue code of
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
section 172 and uh so in online 26 to 27
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
here it makes reference to section 172
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
of the IRC of uh that is very compliant
 
00:57:45.049 --> 00:57:45.059 align:start position:0%
with the 77
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
A1 Roman 20 so this would be the
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code 172 which is
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
relating to the annual deductions
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh that is
 
00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.450 align:start position:0%
uh that is
active

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
active
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh as of the December 31 2018.
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I remember the discussion and
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
everything I was just looking for a
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
mimic uh to
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
trigger memories and and so that the
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have that in
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
front of them it just you know
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sir
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative almond yes
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
um do you need that praise
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
also in um
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
70 72h
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
online 20
 
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:42.250 align:start position:0%
online 20
25

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
or should this be in the definitions of
 
00:58:50.089 --> 00:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
the tax law if we haven't put it there
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
that when we're talking about 172 we're
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
talking about as of date
 
00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.750 align:start position:0%
talking about as of date
so

00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
you're referring to 2274h
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
right so uh no I don't think we need to
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
because it says here that shall conform
 
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
with the r with 172 ircs provided in
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
77a1 Roman 20 and going back to
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
um 77-81 Roman 20 that specifically says
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
Which tax you so it depends on which tax
 
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.829 align:start position:0%
Which tax you so it depends on which tax
you're

00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
we're looking at so uh 77 A1 20 mentions
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
so it's assumed uh adjusted by this
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
section so right it does go back to 20.
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman uh in answer to the
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
listing uh representative Almy brought
 
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:01.940 align:start position:0%
up it was Moody's Analytics of 2021
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh on this stimulative effect of
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
different changes that included the
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
inner well and Phil sledden on the New
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal he also included on
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
page 40 of January of his report of 2023
 
01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:17.809 align:start position:0%
page 40 of January of his report of 2023
so

01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
there is information out there yeah yeah
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
Christmas reliable right let's stick it
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
we'll now close the work session on HP
 
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:51.109 align:start position:0%
we'll now close the work session on HP
450.

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
I was originally going to kind of go
 
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
back and forth between work session and
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
exact session but I'm thinking we may
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
try to just finish through this work
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
session and then go into exactly that
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense yes
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
all right so uh given that I'll open the
 
01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
work session on HB 494 relative to fees
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
collected under the New Hampshire
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
fertilizer law
 
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
comments representative all me thank you
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
I really think that we need uh
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper
 
01:01:26.569 --> 01:01:26.579 align:start position:0%
to talk with us about this because we
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
have a dedicated fund already which is
 
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
supposed to cover fertilizer analysis
 
01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
uh fund 44 in the 612 list
 
01:01:37.619 --> 01:01:39.049 align:start position:0%
uh fund 44 in the 612 list
and

01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:39.059 --> 01:01:40.609 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
it is apparent in the report
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
on that in the 20 2022 dedicated fun
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
book that uh the report from agriculture
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
is that there is a lot of concern in the
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
department that they are unable to carry
 
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
out enough of the functions of that
 
01:02:07.569 --> 01:02:07.579 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund on
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
and fertilizer seems to and liming soil
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
amendment seems to have been a
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
one of the losses
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
from that fund
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
but the question is should we start
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
another fund or should we
 
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.609 align:start position:0%
another fund or should we
um

01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:31.700 align:start position:0%
provide more money for that fund
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
or just forget about something that is
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
very important to Farmers and to people
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
um yes this one we we will have another
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
work session on this one because we are
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
going to need to hear from commissioner
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
Jasper and potentially
 
01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
um or potential others but before we
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
make a decision on that so given that
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have another work session I mean
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
unless someone has something to add
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
right now we'll probably move on
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative would you want
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
senior represent commissioner Jasper I
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
must tell
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
just a little bit too late that we were
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
doing this today and it's my fault on
 
01:03:25.089 --> 01:03:25.099 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if uh represent bitsky
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
Bixby would like to to say anything in
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.619 --> 01:03:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:38.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:48.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
when I put this bill in I was unaware of
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
the existing dedicated fund that
 
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative all me uh as referenced
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh at this point uh the fee income from
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
the from fertilizer and liming goes to
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
the general fund and uh if it's uh if
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill can be amended to realign the
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
that distribution to the existing uh
 
01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:16.549 align:start position:0%
that distribution to the existing uh
um

01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund and and uh work with uh
 
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to make sure that uh
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
the the requirements under RSA 431 are
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
being addressed uh then that would that
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
would uh be an ideal solution I think
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
that probably requires a further work
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
session thank you okay thank you thank
 
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:44.210 align:start position:0%
session thank you okay thank you thank
you

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:47.540 align:start position:0%
all right so we will
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
just comment
 
01:04:53.809 --> 01:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
again on agriculture is meeting with the
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund committee at some point
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh in the near future it is one of those
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
that's been having trouble finding a
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
time if I remember correctly but
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
we should be able to get it done before
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
okay next meeting okay all right sounds
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
good I'm going to close the um work
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
we'll now open the work session on HB
 
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.750 align:start position:0%
we'll now open the work session on HB
569

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
569
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
relative of the State education property
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
tax and low and moderate income
 
01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.370 align:start position:0%
tax and low and moderate income
homeowners

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
so on this bill uh just to start with a
 
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:48.140 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
good to defer
 
01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:52.940 align:start position:0%
um in depth
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
discussion until later in October
 
01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.329 align:start position:0%
discussion until later in October
um

01:05:58.329 --> 01:05:58.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
reasons being that there's litigation
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
going on that may come to
 
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
to a close with a Judicial opinion this
 
01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:11.339 align:start position:0%
direct would be directly on point to the
 
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that um
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
but that uh you know in effect does away
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
with the so-called excess swept uh issue
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
by uh requiring payment of all swept
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
Revenue into the uh State funds uh it
 
01:06:34.809 --> 01:06:34.819 align:start position:0%
won't go into the details of that but
 
01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
instead of being collected and held
 
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:43.460 align:start position:0%
locally it would be all uh deposited uh
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
centrally in this state treasury or with
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
and there's an exception in the bill to
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
that with a new allowance for the costs
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
of collection that is provided for in
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
the bill at three percent per amount
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
collected by locality and that's you
 
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
know to try to compensate in some some
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
way for the effort and work that the
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
localities do in collecting this money
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
for the state so it's a it's a big
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
complicated Bill and it also has a low
 
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:23.660 align:start position:0%
and moderate income tax feature to it
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
and we need to talk about all of that
 
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
but I hope we can do that later on I
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
would say that I know there are
 
01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:34.700 align:start position:0%
two people in the audience
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
one is uh Zach Sheehan from the New
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:41.650 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
project

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:41.660 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
who is on top of the
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
latest status of that lawsuit that I
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I'm not sure there's more
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
to add than what I just said it's no
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
there it's
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's quite likely that the judge will
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
issue a decision within the next 30 days
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
but that's a guess ultimately right and
 
01:08:09.609 --> 01:08:09.619 align:start position:0%
the other person in the audience is
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire who did pass out
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
to all of us a proposed amendment to the
 
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.630 align:start position:0%
to all of us a proposed amendment to the
bill

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know whether you want to
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
hear from him at all that would be fine
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
with me but it is essentially a bill
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
that I based on a conversation I had
 
01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:31.699 align:start position:0%
before uh this meeting with
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire who was good
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
enough to call me about it um
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
it uh essentially whittles down my bill
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
to a focus on the excess swept issue and
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
removes the changes that my bill makes
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
in in the low and moderate
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
or is it homeowner property tax rebate
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
program and uh we can talk about that
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
again later on or however you want to
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
handle it that's fine
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you um I did talk to
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire a little bit
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
earlier and I promised him on a time so
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
if he can come forward and tell us about
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
McGuire I represent the town of Epsom I
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
went to the OLS last week and submitted
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
a bill to
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
um to change the Statewide education
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
property tax into a real tax because now
 
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
it's 100 fake in my opinion and
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
um they said to me you can't do it
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
because it's it's substantially similar
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
to representative Ames Bill the one
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
we're talking about now
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
and so I I don't think it is quite
 
01:09:52.249 --> 01:09:52.259 align:start position:0%
frankly because it doesn't have all
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
those other features and it also has the
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
feature of lowering the amount so that
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
the total amount of property tax
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
collected in the state doesn't change
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
right so if you were to Simply make it
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
into a real tax such that the the
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
donor towns are exempt start paying well
 
01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
that will collect for you an extra 25 28
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
million something like that and so
 
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.149 align:start position:0%
million something like that and so
therefore

01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's actually you know it's a raise
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
in taxes in some sense but if you but so
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
my my Amendment here is just the nut of
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
it which is to say
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
have all the municipalities pay their
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
actual tax
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
um and the net result of that
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
if the donor towns start paying would be
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
a higher collection so the bill also
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
reduces the total number from the 363 by
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
25 million so that the total amount of
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
property tax paid in the state doesn't
 
01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.910 align:start position:0%
property tax paid in the state doesn't
change

01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
um and that's the the essence of it
 
01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:04.340 align:start position:0%
um and I guess
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know if you decide I could always go
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
to the rules committee and ask to
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
introduce this as a new bill for next
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
year maybe they would agree maybe they
 
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.790 align:start position:0%
year maybe they would agree maybe they
wouldn't

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
um but you know if you decide just to
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
simply not consider this at this time
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's up to you I also handed out a
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
um supporting pieces of information and
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm just wondering if you talked
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
to dra about the process of doing this
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that if you're
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
going to have a state a real state tax I
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
agree with you that what we have now is
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
not a real state tax
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
seems to me they would have to collect
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
it they would have to send out the bills
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
and not everybody pays their property
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
tax on time so that they would be the
 
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
ones that would have to charge interest
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
or you know somehow do the collection on
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
their tax it could get pretty
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
complicated yes thank you for the
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
the way it works now is people pay their
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
property taxes and their towns collected
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know all the all the four different
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
components right the the
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
um the town component the county
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
component the state and the and the
 
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
school component and so this bill
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that it just says instead
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
of taking that state component and
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
sending it to the school district send
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
it to dra instead so it's already being
 
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
collected it's already going somewhere
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
right it's going from the town to the
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
school district so it's just you know
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
redirects it to the other place so I
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.970 align:start position:0%
follow-up
okay

01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
no I think we want to go really deep
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
into yeah I don't want to go too deep
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
into this because we're going to have
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
all right so representative Olney
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
text the amount that is going uh that is
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paid by the excess
 
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh payment towns like no
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
what why
 
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
it's going down to 338
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes because
 
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's already going down every single
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
year with inflation
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
well that's true too but
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
um because as a result of everyone
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
paying right and sending money to dra
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
there will be an extra
 
01:13:58.729 --> 01:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
if you look at this spreadsheet roughly
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
28 million dollars going to dra slightly
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
less but but essentially I didn't my my
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
intention was not to raise property
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
taxes right so so in order to not do
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
that out on a Statewide basis right
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
because we're going to start charging
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
this would start charging a Statewide
 
01:14:20.649 --> 01:14:20.659 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
you have to lower the whole amount
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
because certain places they're not
 
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
can't talk
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I just say that I I understand what
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
you're doing the uh currently
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
in the excess swept towns the excess is
 
01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:55.699 align:start position:0%
the amount above
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
the adequate education and cost of
 
01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
adequate education that is uh calculated
 
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
for the each of those towns and they've
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
raised more than that and the current
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
system allows them not only to retain
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
the sweat that's collected for adequate
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
education but also to retain the excess
 
01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
above the cost of adequate education and
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
to apply it to the local school costs or
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
actually in some cases where they don't
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
have local school costs to apply it in a
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
negative sense as an offset against
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal rates
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
and what you're saying well that 30
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
million dollars will shave that excess
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
that amounts to is you came up with 25
 
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.130 align:start position:0%
that amounts to is you came up with 25
million

01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to shave that off and we're
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
going to set the new amount that needs
 
01:15:56.649 --> 01:15:56.659 align:start position:0%
to be raised by this tax at 363 minus 25
 
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
and then dra will figure out the tax
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
rate across the state that produces that
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
amount and all that money will flow into
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right so as I said we'll we're going
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
to come back to this topic in another
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
another work session
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
one last comment representative the
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
original reason we ended up with the
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
system we've got is that the towns came
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
in and waved 28a at us and told us that
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
on we needed to pay them 10 million
 
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
dollars to collect it
 
01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.850 align:start position:0%
dollars to collect it
uh

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:42.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I I do think it would be useful
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
before the next meeting if the dra would
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
whether there is excess cost
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
on on their end and from the local
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
that there that particularly the
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities would be complaining
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
about okay we'll follow up on that all
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
right uh this time I'm going to close
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
all right we have three Senate bills um
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
immediately following that
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%

all right seeing none we'll close the
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
I'll now open the work session on sb190
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%

comment representative just to say I
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%

that additional discussion okay thank
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%

work session it's relative to the road
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
toll registration surcharge for electric
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles and representative plett you
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
have a comment yes this is now moot
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
because the substance of it was included
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
all right um yes represent elberger just
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
a quick comment that uh the state of
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
Texas imposed a 200 uh surcharge on
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
owners of electric vehicles
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
so we look like we're relatively cheap
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
all right any other comments
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%

the work session on s p 191
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh I think what we're going to do right
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
now is take a five minute break but it's
 
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:40.020 align:start position:0%

01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
minutes to start the uh exec session
 
01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%

representative Platt would you like to
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
make a motion I shall
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
I move interim study
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
or HP 15 and the logic is uh we wait
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
wait wait we got to get a second first
 
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.330 align:start position:0%
wait wait we got to get a second first
second

01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.430 align:start position:0%
second
okay

01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
who did it representative well
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
all right would you like to speak to
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
01:27:50.219 --> 01:27:52.129 align:start position:0%
your motion
yes

01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:52.139 --> 01:27:53.090 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
the logic for this is that uh reduction
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the written business profit business
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax often comes back in
 
01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
better future
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
business profits tax but uh we we
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
included a be a reduction it was
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
included in hb2 a reduction speed up of
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the interest and
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
dividends tax and I think that's enough
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
for one biennium
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative almi thank you is that
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%

01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
we retain the bill
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
I think is interim starting to go to the
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
house yeah he goes before the house okay
 
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:48.900 align:start position:0%

we risk alienating tourists and visitors

interim study on a consent calendar is
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
will someone check on that
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
we will check yeah because it seems
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
strange to me
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure why it is a blurb it
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
even goes if it's in our study but well
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%

a status it's a motion that will be
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
voted on by the whole house so it goes
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
on consent or the regular calendar just
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
like any other committee report so
 
01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's why it does get a committee
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
report that will be printed in the house
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%

the interim study request was made uh

01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
after long and exhaustive committee work
 
01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
and under the guidance of the Attorney
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
General a very different bill was
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
introduced to the house
 
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
we've also understand that as a result
 
01:39:32.699 --> 01:39:33.890 align:start position:0%
we've also understand that as a result
of

01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
both our work and the complaints from
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
other states a test case of sorts with
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
South Dakota established thresholds and
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
nearly all of the 45 sales tax states
 
01:39:48.610 --> 01:39:48.620 align:start position:0%
have made modifications
 
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
along those lines only Colorado and
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
Louisiana have not done so and that is
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
due to a state constitutional issues
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
allowing local sales tax imposition
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire law allows the
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
AG's office to intercede on behalf of
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses made subject
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
across jurisdictional sales taxation
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill is unnecessary
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%

01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:19.980 align:start position:0%

yes thank you um
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
very briefly as was mentioned in the
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
work session the bill has become moot
 
01:44:31.570 --> 01:44:31.580 align:start position:0%
because fees were incorporated into hb2
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
assessing 50 on a hybrid vehicle and a
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars on an electric vehicle
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
no need for the bill itl
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
sorry specifically I think that the law
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
in hb2 is not hybrid but plug-in hybrid
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
which is a very different object I'm
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Platt and I think you
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
should be immune quite frankly because
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
you have a very small Fiats and you have
 
01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:13.209 align:start position:0%
you have a very small Fiats and you have
huge

01:45:13.209 --> 01:45:13.219 align:start position:0%
huge
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
RAM trucks all paying the same gas tax
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
so you're just happen to be on the
 
01:45:21.169 --> 01:45:21.179 align:start position:0%
fishing end of a non plug non-plug-in
 
01:45:21.179 --> 01:45:25.490 align:start position:0%
fishing end of a non plug non-plug-in
vehicle

01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:28.260 align:start position:0%

01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
go go look at that we have
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
um about another six weeks to get these
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
retained bills done but not that we want
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
to stretch we don't want to stretch it
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
out to the very end so we will
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
try to schedule something fairly soon
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
and uh keep moving forward
 
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
anyone any questions come representative
 
01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
Ames just wondering about timing for
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh the blurbs or reports on each of
 
01:47:48.370 --> 01:47:48.380 align:start position:0%
these bills what
 
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
do you mean it's a good question I think
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
I've got to do one it's obviously going
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
to be very short but still I have to do
 
01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.330 align:start position:0%
to be very short but still I have to do
it

01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
well we Pro yes uh Mr chair I don't
 
01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
think we're in terrible how are we
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
because our next section was January 3rd
 
01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
but we should still make it timely
 
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
enough so that we don't forget yeah I
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
would say we want it um
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
I mean we don't necessarily have to rush
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
it again into this calendar but I would
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
say it'd be good to have them all in by
 
01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.330 align:start position:0%
say it'd be good to have them all in by
Friday

01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.410 align:start position:0%
Friday
yeah

01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
yeah that's okay
 
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.709 align:start position:0%
yeah that's okay
representative

01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
none of these bills go into the calendar
 
01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:26.450 align:start position:0%
none of these bills go into the calendar
until

01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:30.410 align:start position:0%
until
January

01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:31.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
well we still want them in um to the
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah Auto out of the out of the
 
01:48:37.679 --> 01:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
yeah Auto out of the out of the
committee

01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I think it makes sense
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
just get it done if we set a longer time
 
01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:46.139 align:start position:0%
uh frame then people are just going to
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
wait longer so I send them in to you or
 
01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.350 align:start position:0%
wait longer so I send them in to you or
um

01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
or whatever yes uh send them to me okay
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
she gets a signal from you yeah okay
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine yeah
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
um or
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
sorry can you let us
 
01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
um give us some idea of which day
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
the next meeting might happen fairly
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
soon because there are a lot of people
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
going in different directions well do we
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
have do we have weeks where people are
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
let me just represents leaving until a
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
third of October right after he gives
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
you that
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
after gets out of what he gives you his
 
01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
blurb oh okay
 
01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.729 --> 01:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
2019. so you're uh representative Ames
 
01:49:56.770 --> 01:49:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean that that that is next
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
that would be next week
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
um the week
 
01:50:03.119 --> 01:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
um the week
um

01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
I'm gone half a week in the first week
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
of October so we probably uh so that we
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
don't delay this too far maybe we we try
 
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
to shoot for October 3rd Tuesday October
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
3rd how does that look for
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
for people before would be better but
 
01:50:26.109 --> 01:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
what's that October 3rd is tight for me
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
well October 4th maybe it's only
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
available in the afternoon for me it's
 
01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
only available in the afternoon for me
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:50:35.159 --> 01:50:36.910 align:start position:0%
as well
um

01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:39.659 align:start position:0%
how about Wednesday
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
no Wednesdays that is the fourth the
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so when are you back
 
01:50:46.129 --> 01:50:46.139 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I've got in my mind October three oh
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
yeah what's the fifth one
 
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
I well I can't do the fourth fifth or
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess we could and I suggest the
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
following I guess we can do that I'm
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
gonna weigh that fourth through a
 
01:51:05.570 --> 01:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
seventh as well oh you are okay
 
01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
all right well yeah the following week
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
looks fairly
 
01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:11.390 align:start position:0%
looks fairly
um

01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
yeah how about um either Tuesday the
 
01:51:15.770 --> 01:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
10th or Wednesday the 11th
 
01:51:21.709 --> 01:51:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.719 --> 01:51:23.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:23.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else Wednesday that's just
 
01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
10th is Tuesday
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.129 --> 01:51:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
all right let's um
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an equal mix here of
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays and Wednesdays let's do Tuesday
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
all right so Tuesday the 10th we'll
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
uh I mean the one thing we have to
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
figure out is whether we can try to get
 
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
as many of these done as possible
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
whether we can I'll have to take a look
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
at them if we
 
01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know we might want to start a little
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
bit earlier say around 9 30.
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
so that uh that's doable for everyone
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we're going to
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
shoot for Tuesday the 10th at 9 30. plan
 
01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:20.990 align:start position:0%
shoot for Tuesday the 10th at 9 30. plan
on

01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
um plan on a potential full day
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know if that changes I'll let you
 
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
know but for now
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
that'll be the plan
 
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Ami you can
 
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
get Gen 4 to
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
call up the people you need to be there
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
yes right yeah we'll plan that
 
01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:48.590 align:start position:0%
yes right yeah we'll plan that
okay

01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
all right thank you everyone
 
01:53:05.689 --> 01:53:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.699 --> 01:53:08.420 align:start position:0%
