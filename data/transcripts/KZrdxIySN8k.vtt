you Senator gray having broken the ice
 
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
two times ago with what he called an
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
Engineers joke uh when his staffer said
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't be here today I asked the
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
staffer to make sure should this happen
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
again that he forwards an engineered
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
joke at least because it's not part of
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
my genre but engineered jokes I guess
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
have a place so she said she would make
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
sure of it approval of the draft minutes
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
from January 26 you should have uh one
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
of the ways you know it's a draft as it
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
says draft on it and
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh if you haven't read it over take a
 
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair if I may I will apologize
 
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start position:0%
there are chunks that I omitted because
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
we were going through slides and and uh
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman in particular walked us
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
through a number of slides and I could
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
not look at the slide and write at the
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
same time and the result is that my
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
notes for his walk through those slides
 
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
were completely incomprehensible so I
 
00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
apologize for any emissions and if
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
there's any glaring emissions I hope
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
people will answer and yet you produced
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
three and a half pages which is wow I
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
know that that's not a comparison
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
assistant observation criticize somebody
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
who's willing to sit in and I was
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
say that's right and my thanks to
 
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
representative King that I don't have to
 
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
again I'll make a motion to approve the
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
minutes second second let's continue to
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
is actually I may you may um I did show
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
up late because of the the weather but I
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
I was here
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
just it
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
it it does not at the beginning because
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
you weren't here at the beginning but on
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
page two under maternal mortality report
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph says uh
 
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald arrived at the
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
start of this part having been delayed
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
by vehicle accident tie ups and then you
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
will find at the very end end of the
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
minutes that um a quorum having been
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
achieved the December minutes were moved
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
second and accepted by a vote of four
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
and one
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
exstension at the very end which is
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
where we did them I if somebody would
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
prefer that it says um McDonald late at
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
the top that's fine but I I just did
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
them in real time you graciously
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
announced his entrance it's very
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
accurate yes although I don't know if I
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
want to be associated with maternal
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
mortality enough
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
exact only a
 
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
coincidence any uh further Reflections
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.190 align:start position:0%
on the
minutes

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
yeses on second page there's a typo if
 
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
it makes any difference where on the
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
fourth paragraph down the annual annual
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
WS you sure she doesn't mean it was wow
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
it could have been could have been so
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that up to the discretion of
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
the uh clerk at the
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
time yeah the context yeah could either
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
correctly that's because I started with
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
the excellent agenda given to us by Mr
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
Williams as my foundational document and
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
I simply used his agenda items going
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
forward word for the headings and that
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
was very helpful because I had all the
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
correct spelling of all the names and
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
didn't have an opportunity to mess it up
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
when I transcribed
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
it anything
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
else moved and seconded all in favor I I
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
item the chair recogn I did that on
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
purpose the check chair recognizes
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Dr Marissa hen to
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
give us the
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
dhs's commissioner
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
update good morning morning so um at HHS
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
oversight last month we had um Justin
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
lucer join us from Hamstead Hospital
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
talking about children's mental health
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
and how we're expanding services to
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
those in need of acute Services it it
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
seemed um like we we owed you another
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
update on more on the adult side um and
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
our work to uh to eliminate emergency
 
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
department boarding since that's been a
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
huge area of work and there have been
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
many questions that this group has
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
raised relative to the important uh
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
topic of emergency department boarding
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
so wanted to give you an overview um and
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh seek your questions and input on that
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
topic um so first just I think everyone
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
is aware of what emergency department
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
boarding is but it might be worth um
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
just making sure we're on the same page
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
with with that definition so um there
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
are times when uh individuals uh are in
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis um and they go to an
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
emergency department because as we know
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
emergency departments are are open uh
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
24/7 they can't turn people away and so
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
as they seek services for one reason or
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
another um they find themselves there
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
and they are assessed um and in some
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
cases the uh Team there the social
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
workers the clinicians the phys Ians
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
determine that that patient needs a
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
higher level of care in an impatient
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
setting and as you might have heard
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
there is not uh the the number of the
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
the supply of impatient beds in New
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like across the country um has
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
not been sufficient in recent years to
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
keep up with the demand so what ends up
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
happening is a um a pretty awful
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
phenomenon a very traumatic phenomenon
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
for these patients where they sit in
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
these emergency departments sometimes um
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
in windowless rooms sometimes even in
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
hallways um for hours days waiting for
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
an patient psychiatric bed to open up
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
and if you can imagine um this being uh
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
among their most challenging darkest
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
days for themselves their families um
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
the experience for for the uh the
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
patient and their loved ones and for the
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
hospital staff is um has many negative
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
Ripple effects um and during that time
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
often times their already poor mental
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
health deteriorates much further so um
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
as a department we started working on
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
the issue of reducing this burden of
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
folks waiting for beds um with the
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
release of our 2019 10year mental health
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
plan however we realized there was a
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
need uh to accelerate a number of key
 
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
elements of that um given the continued
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh numbers that were just unacceptable
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
given the concerns of many stakeholders
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
and Advocates um and given the impacts
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
of covid on societal mental health we
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
were seeing an increase as opposed to a
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
decrease in some of those boarding
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
numbers and as you might have heard
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
there was also the state was being sued
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
um by a group of hospitals to do
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
something about this and so that added
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
um a little a little bit more um oomph
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
to our efforts and so we decided rather
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
than trying to solve this alone as a
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
department we really needed to come
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
together with an array of stakeholders
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
including the who were suing us um to
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
say what can we do together we all
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
accept that it is um we all accept that
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's unacceptable for any patient to be
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
um waiting for longer than uh you know
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
some reasonable period of time to get
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
into a a critical level of care and just
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
as you would never deny a patient who's
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
in uh cardiac arrest and just have them
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
sit in emergency department it should be
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
no different when it comes to a
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health crisis so we formed a
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
team and last year um we first realized
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
we need needed to diagnose the issue in
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
a new way because just building beds
 
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't cut it in our state and in other
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
states and so on the two-page document
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
that you have you can see essentially
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing what other states have done
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
that has made a difference reviewing um
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh sort of best practice and then
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
looking at New Hampshire data we
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
assessed the situation to involve three
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
key drivers those drivers are um excuse
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
me could you show us what this do sorry
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
colorful one yep thank you
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
um so the yeah yeah the key drivers of
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
the problem um were first uh what we
 
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
have termed front door issues so this is
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
sort of why do people go to the
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
emergency department in psychiatric
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
crisis in the first place it may be that
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
they have experienced um a life event or
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
a deterioration in their mental
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
well-being but it may be because we have
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
not provided enough options in the
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
community to to prevent and to to offer
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
them another Avenue for for services and
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
by we I don't just mean the state I mean
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
I think society as a whole and so front
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
door issues kind of what are the drivers
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
that actually lead to someone being in
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
such a situation of feeling unsafe to
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
themselves or others that they need to
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
be in that restrictive clinical context
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
um are the first set of issues the
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
second um core set of factors are the
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
ones that we've tended to uh focus on in
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
the past which is really our impatient
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
Supply but also our coordination issues
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
um so right now if you or a loved one is
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
sitting um in an emergency department in
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needing a psychiatric bed
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
that hospital traditionally has been
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
calling around desperately to all the
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals that have psychiatric beds
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
trying to find you a place turns out
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
that is not a very efficient way to go
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
about things um and it can create
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
situations of just a a very
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
uncoordinated very fragmented I won't
 
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
even call it a system it's um it's sort
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
of a a good luck um you know uh way of
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
navigating things and so the actual
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
coordination of the beds that we do have
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to the overall number number
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
is the second um factor and then the
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
final is we have a phenomenon where
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
patients can sometimes end up staying in
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitals longer than they
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
need to because there's not um
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate plans and services and
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
supports to help them safely return to
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
the community so that could be things
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
like lack of housing that could be lack
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
of other social and um Human Service
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
supports um and so forth and so that
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
would essentially you can get people who
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
um are taking up beds from those who
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
newly need it because of those back door
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
issues so that's kind of how we bird's
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
eye view looked at the issue and then to
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
fast forward through a lot of work and
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
Analysis and meetings and um research
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
that went on we ended up saying okay we
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
can't do everything but let's find six
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
things we can do as a state working in
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
Partnership that will move the dial and
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
so and that that are aligned fully with
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
our tenure Mental Health Plan and so
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to just give you a
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
brief update of what those six core are
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
are um we don't pretend to think that
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
this is everything we don't pretend to
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
think that any one of these is going to
 
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
be a silver bullet but by addressing all
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
of these we can start to move those
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
three factors I walked you um through
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
and so just to go um on to the second
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
page and to bring you to present day uh
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
for around what has been going on here
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
again in in concert and through a very
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
structured governance system with New
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association Nami the
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers Patient
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
Advocates people with lived experience
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
we have we've uh cast a wide net in
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
terms of of those who are steering this
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
um ship so I'll briefly go through these
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
um and then um and then seek your your
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
questions um so starting kind of from
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
that front door and moving through the
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
impatient and then back door the first
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
has been embracing a model that um
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson as we've gone to
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
a couple uh National events have heard a
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
lot about um it's really The Cutting
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
Edge for Community Mental Health the
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
certified community behavioral health
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
model essentially building on the
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center as
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
they're known today but integrating
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
Services across the lifespan so kids and
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
adults um not excluding substance use um
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
from the equation and then engaging in
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
alternative payment models that make all
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
of this more sustainable and more based
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
on um performance of of the center so
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
long story short we received a planning
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
Grant We have basically the entire
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
States network of Community Mental
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
Health Centers engaged Nami brandise
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
others working with us and samsa the
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
federal um subance Abuse and Mental
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
Health um Services Administration
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
working with us to expand this model in
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and already have two
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
ccbhcs prime to receive patients um by
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
next spring and are on our road toward
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
um being eligible for a federal
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
demonstration Grant so it's not going to
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
fix things overnight but Most states
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
have seen an increase in about 25%
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 15 and 25% the number
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
of patients they can serve so this is
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
sort of a door to that um access
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully diverting people from needing
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
emergency department care when their
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
needs have uh
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
exacerbated the second is um having an
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
expanded array of options when people
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
are in crisis so as you might be aware
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
um we currently in New Hampshire a year
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
and a half two years ago launched both a
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
phone and chat service um that is part
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the 988 umbrella of services so that
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
someone who is experiencing a
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
psychiatric or Behavioral Health crisis
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
has um have folks they can reach out to
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
who are highly trained there's also
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams that can be deployed
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
to go to somebody's um home Community
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
School to reach them um and this is the
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
third leg on that stool so in addition
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
to the phone chat the uh mobile crisis
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
this is a physical place to go that is
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
an alternative to an emergency
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
department to get stabilizing services
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
so picture sort of an armchair type
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
setting you can be there up to 23 and a
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
half hours just shy of an overnight um
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
and um often times avoid the need for
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care by getting that
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
specialized Services well in crisis so
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
we have two of these um community- based
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
crisis stabilization centers opening um
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
and the first is coming online this year
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and more to come and an array of
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
federal technical assistance um as well
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
as State
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
dollars third so now we're moving oh
 
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
please yes go ahead thank
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
you sorry um I know you wanted questions
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
at the end but I'm really confused at
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
this point between
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh one and the certified Community
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
whatever BH is clinics and the uh
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
location based crisis centers and and
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
you said two of the first ones were
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
coming online and then I I've gotten
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
confused about what those are and
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
whether they're two different things or
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
the same thing yeah no problem it's a
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
lot of acronyms and similar sounding um
 
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
terms so it's uh so the the the first
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
one the community behavioral health
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
clinics are essentially building on what
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
is what you know now as the the
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers it's but
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
they're in addition to well they're
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
actually it's a it's a transformation of
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
those existing services so of those
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
existing centers so they are basically
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
growing their services who they can
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
serve how they serve and their financial
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
sustainability to become certified as
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
ccbhc so it's sort of uh think of it as
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know our current community
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system uh on steroids
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
um and so a huge amount of growth
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
happening there the crisis centers the
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
second one is really meant to be a
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
specific setting for people who would
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise um likely need to go to
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
emergency department because they are
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
not safe to themselves or others so it's
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
short-term Subacute stay um not meant to
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
be like a you know it's not it's sort of
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
that midpoint between an emergency
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
department and a impatient psychiatric
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
bed but often um negating the need for
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
either by by better serving people in
 
00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
the midst of that crisis that um psych
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
psychotic break that you know life event
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
that has happened that has really shaken
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
them to their core so basic deescalation
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
is what deescalation stabilization
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
medication management so and referrals I
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
mean I think the idea isn't that it's
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
sort of a a you know one stop and you're
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
done but you're actually if you're not
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
already connected to outpatient
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
resources so you could actually come
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
into the crisis center and then be
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
referred out to a the first row the um
 
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
the community uh Behavioral Health
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
Clinic which is more of an outpatient um
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing care
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
does that help yep thank you very much I
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate it of course so now moving
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
into that impatient zone of having the
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
right number of beds coordinating
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
efficiently among those beds um we are
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
terming this feature care traffic
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
control um because we want to sort of
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
evoke that notion of a centralized
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
service for making sure people or you
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
know kind of air traffic control uh uh
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
metaphor like are getting to the right
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
place and that there's a sense of of
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
centralized accountability for them so
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
what this amounts to is a the hospitals
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
and we have our own work groups and um
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
collaborations going on in this the
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals are at the table New Hampshire
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
hospital is at the table the community
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
entities are at the table saying here's
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a standardized process
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
whenever one of these patients is
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
involuntarily admitted or invol in need
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
of involuntary Services we're all going
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
to fill out the same paperwork we're
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
going to send a centralized packet of
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
information to New Hampshire hospital to
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
agree with us that we all that this
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
patient needs to have their uh needs to
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
be hospitalized involuntarily and then
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to work together to say
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
here's how many beds I have here's my
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
Staffing situation much like during
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
covid the hospitals came together to to
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
share information and to sort of work as
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
one system this is the first phases of
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
moving toward an actual centralized
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
Statewide system um and so it's we soft
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
launched in January by centralizing as I
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
I said that that documentation and
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
process of um submitting the the uh
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
justification for involuntary
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
hospitalization we're now moving in and
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
we hired four positions actually at New
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to actually
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
facilitate all this communication and
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
and data exchange and now we're moving
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
into the more meaningful and challenging
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
work of how do we actually uh
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
acknowledge and coordinate when we have
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
a referral so that if this patient's
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
sitting at the Elliott and this patient
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
sitting at conquered Hospital we
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
actually have a Way in real time of
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
sharing information and getting the
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
patients to the right place at the right
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
time so it's a huge lift um Mo anyway we
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
can talk more about it but it's but it's
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
a major feature of how we make use of
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
the beds we do have while we expand that
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
array and that brings me to the fourth
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
one which is actually expanding what we
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
call Designated receiving facility beds
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is a designation that is giving
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
given by the state um recognizing that
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
these hospitals um including New
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital are able to accept
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
involuntary admission
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
but basically think of these as
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health beds um in our public
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
system so there's a number of ways that
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to increase the supply of
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
beds to be more right-sized with demand
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
um one is getting New Hampshire hospital
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
up to its full capacity of 184 by the
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
end of this year um another is setting
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
up for the first time the northernmost
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
believe it or not um drf beds at
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um allowing Dartmouth to have
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
a five bed drf unit and then finally you
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
may have heard about this major
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
behavioral health project that the state
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
is providing 15 million towards that
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
solution Health um is setting up in
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire so this will be a
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
new behavioral health facility um and
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
the state is providing funding but also
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
um having very special requirements to
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that it is um serving the most
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in our system for the record
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
where in Southern New Hampshire so this
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
is now public the the the proposed site
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
is in londondary okay and they've
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
approached that's thank you yeah and the
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
lenon Jerry Town Council and all those
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
processes are unfolding so happy to
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
provide more updates on that um second
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
to last on the list is thinking about
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
that back door so how do we make sure
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we're getting people great care in
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
an appropriate impatient setting and
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
then we are getting them returned safely
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
smoothly um with support to the
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
community thus um hopefully preventing
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
their need to return to an impatient
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
setting while opening up those beds for
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
others who will need it
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
um so there's a number of things going
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
on here um one that's been quite
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful is we have patients um at New
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital who have been there
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
for many many many days like sometimes
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
hundreds of days because the type of
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
care they need is in a nursing home
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
level of care so they both have a
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
psychiatric level of need that has been
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
treated but they also are um
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing uh medical fragility as
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
well and for that population we were
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
able to partner and help fund through
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
straford County nursing home um a
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate far less restrictive
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
Community oriented Services thus getting
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
them into a much more appropriate and
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic setting for their needs than
 
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital recom uh uh
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
represents so that's one example there's
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
also a number of um contracts that we've
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
signed to to start uh other residential
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
transitional housing programs that are
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
listed here so housing not surprisingly
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
a huge determinant of uh health and
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
mental health and a major factor when it
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
comes to not just helping patients
 
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
discharge but but preventing them from
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
needing that acute level of care in uh
 
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
in the future hopefully where are the
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
two uh five bid programs about to start
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
at that is a really good question and I
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
don't have Julianne here it um I'm gonna
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
have to get back to you on that one I
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure I know but I don't want
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
so um and then the last one is landlord
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
incentives so this is actually um we
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
just got this passed um at uh at
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
governor and councel so there's a really
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
neat program that gr Granite United Way
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
runs to help landlords become more
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable um accepting as tenants
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
people with mental illness recognizing
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
that um that process of being a landlord
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
to someone especially with a serious
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
mental illness requires knowledge
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility Financial reserves in the
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
event that someone breaks something um
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
and it requires a team of community
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
providers to be working to keep that
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
person stable um this is a population in
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
an already crunched housing environment
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
that is often disproportionately um
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
challenged when it comes to getting into
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
housing so we will have 25 patients
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
moved into stable housing through this
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
expanded partnership with granite United
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
Way um by the midpoint of this year so
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
taken in whole these are all again this
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
isn't we're not trying to claim that
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
this is going to um any one of these as
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a silver bullet what we're what
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
we're attempting to do is to
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
dramatically change the the way that we
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
think about serving people with mental
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
illness who are ending up in our
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
emergency departments in hopes of
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically reducing and eventually
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
eliminating um any of those uh those
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
experiences of boarding so that's that's
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
a plan um a lot more coming at you and
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
updates for you as we work on our public
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
facing data dashboard but um but that's
 
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.110 align:start position:0%
facing data dashboard but um but that's
the

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'd be very
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
interested you may not have it in the
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
data dashboards that you're talking
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
about may help but you know we hear the
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
numbers daily on the boarding crisis
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
ands and I would be very much interested
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
to know what the numbers are for the
 
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.750 align:start position:0%
to know what the numbers are for the
back

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
door Log Jam because um it it does
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
contribute in all the ways you've
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
recognized and I suddenly realized that
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
we have there aren't as many loud
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
metrics about that
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
and um that's so that's one thing I
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
would just love to see if you have it
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
and then the other question I have is
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
about uh a little more about the
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
psychiatric nursing home issue I know we
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
have the Glen Cliff home um and so now
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
we have the partnership with um
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
Strafford straford
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
um could you tell me a little more about
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
the the straford partnership because I'm
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking click click click uh about
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
my own nursing home and the issue there
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
of course is Staff rather and under
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
utilization but it just it it hurts me
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we have facilities available that
 
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.990 align:start position:0%
that we have facilities available that
are

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
underused when we have patients in need
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
in so many different Health
 
00:31:51.639 --> 00:31:53.430 align:start position:0%
in so many different Health
Care

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
Care
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
niches um and it also kills me that um
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
chesher Med used to have either a six or
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
an8 bed psychiatric unit and when their
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist retired they couldn't find
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
another one and and the governor yelled
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
at me you're telling me there is no
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist in cheser County well I
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
don't know whether there is or isn't but
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
we couldn't find one yeah and actually I
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
should mention the the there's also a
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
whole specialty field of geros
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care that um when we made
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
the agreement with solution health for
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
their new facility includes um the the
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
expansion by 16 beds they already have a
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
a small psychiatric unit at the Elliot
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
Jos psychiatric unit but this will
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
expand that um by I think another 16
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
beds so um so in terms of the the
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
straford county Arrangement and there
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
are others here who can speak to it more
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
so um Glen Cliffe is a a key part and a
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
you know one of the state run 247
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
facilities for for individuals in need
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
of both psychiatric and nursing home
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
care but there's a weight list for Glen
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
Cliffe and Glen Cliff doesn't always
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
always make the most sense if you've
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
ever visited it and if you haven't
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
highly recommend it it is a stunning
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
former tuberculosis sanatorium on the
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
side of Mount musak it is it is a
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
remarkable place that is as New
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as it gets and it's also very
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
remote and so um one of the things
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's been nice with straford county is
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
some of the patients who have been able
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
to discharge from New Hampshire hospital
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
have roots in that area so not only are
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
they closer to Natural supports but the
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
part of the model what we're financially
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
supporting there is a regular
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
reassessment so that they don't if they
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
can move from a nursing home to an even
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
less restrictive setting that is the
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
expectation um and the the design so our
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
hope is um not that Glen Cliff won't
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
continue to play an important role but
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
this is diversifying both geographically
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the number and array of
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
um of beds available uh as an
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
alternative to to an impatient the most
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
restrictive setting there is
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy yeah thank you uh
 
00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and looking at number three
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
the drf beds the five beds at uh at
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth yes is that the end result of
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
the negotiated um um government mandate
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
that they accept patients and are these
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
beds in Lebanon the beds are in Lebanon
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
we actually toured the the site um
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
recently I don't um this was not a
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
requirement I I think I know what you're
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
referring to because there were previous
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
deals that Dartmouth was involved with
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
there was a um the merger between uh
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
exiter hospital and I'm going to get it
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
wrong who their partner was did have a
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
requirement of 10 drf beds so that's
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
actually we don't have it listed here
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
but we are tracking the exiter project
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
as that was a requirement um per the
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
Attorney General um charitable uh uh
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
review of that uh merger follow Mr
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah follow up just a have we
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
ever in this whole you know having lived
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
through many of these in um emergency
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
room uh housing of these patients have
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
you are you aware have there been any
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
mtala violations in the state with any
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
of these patients U over the course of
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
the last few years it's a good question
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't uh it's you're not the first
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
to raise it and I don't know the answer
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
so let me um let me get back to you on
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
for taking the question also I want to
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
commend the department for putting
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
together I think a well thought through
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh plan of
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
action as we monitor through this going
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
forward being in the committee what are
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
your thoughts of having sort of a
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
metrics dealing with the front door
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
issues the impatient Supply and
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
coordination and also the backd door
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
issues so we can sort of track progress
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
and how we're doing and try to
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
understand of these three components is
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
there one still having significant
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
issues that we have to address maybe
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
legislatively so what are you thoughts
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
on trying to provide to this committee
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
and ultimately to the legislative body
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
sort of a tracking mechanism to how
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing very reminiscent of your
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
question about Hamstead last meeting um
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
for which I think data is is an
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
essential um part of how we're uh going
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
to manage the challenges at hand so the
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
answer is um we're completely committed
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
to that and in fact the data work group
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
that again is formed not just the
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
department but also we have um data
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
analysts from the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
Association from the Community Mental
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
Health Centers from Nami um the intent
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
is to be fully transparent so ideas like
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
representative Webbers around
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
um for the you know emphasizing that
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
back door issue will be part of that
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
right now if you go to our website there
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
is a list you can look at the drf the
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
the facilities that have drf beds right
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
now and the number of people that are
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
waiting you can also see a a snapshot of
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
Hamstead but it's not a very it's not
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
the level of depth and it's not
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
connected to tracking progress and
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
challenges on these initiatives as it
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be so we expect in the next two
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
months or so we should have a prototype
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
and would be happy to share um the
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
website but also bring some visuals here
 
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative Edwards uh
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you Dr H for
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I'm I'm I saw this
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner was over at the
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
governor's commission so so I saw this
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
get the double of both of us yeah but
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's such an important topic I'm really
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
glad I I was thinking about um the
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
visual information aspect of this and
 
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
and what what my mind would like to have
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
is uh your classic uh graph that uh from
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
left to right is time and I'd like to
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
see you know two two numbers tracked so
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
we could look at the lines over time and
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
one line uh to me would want to be um
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
the number of drf beds under Central
 
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
visibility mhm uh which by the way I
 
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
think is great that you guys have
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
Central visibility now that was a huge
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
part of solving this problem so that's
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
great uh and then the second line
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
obviously would be uh you know the
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
number being boarded and I know that
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
that boarded number changes you know
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
hourly but you know if you could just
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
pick a predict or a stable point in time
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
to where we could at least have some
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
comparison as we look at it over time I
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
mean it would be so great just to look
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
at one graph and go okay there's our
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
capacity there's our you know the other
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
line is we we're solving the problem or
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
we're not um so so yeah no we're we're I
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
think that's exactly the the trend data
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
that we have in mind we actually in
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
hiring the four care traffic control
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
positions um one of those is a business
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
systems analyst um to very much increase
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
our sophistication around what we
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
measure also um as you may be aware we
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
are required to provide um quarterly
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
reports to the judge who ruled in the
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
decision um in which the hospitals
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
resuing the state and so we have to uh
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
she has asked for that data to be
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
generated anyway so we're we're totally
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
on it followup followup so so you just
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
opened the segue to to my other question
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
was I I don't know Mr chair because I I
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
haven't been around much how frequently
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting the these boarding updates
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
but if the department has to generate
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
something quarterly uh uh would it be
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay if we asked to get just get a
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
courtesy copy so we could be um tracking
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
along this is this is be okay for you to
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
ask this this would this is a strategic
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
problem and I think we really need to
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
have our eyes on it yeah we are happy to
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
provide um those quarterly updates as I
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
said we are in the process of
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
prototyping our dashboard so right now
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
actually we've um the courts asked us to
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
provide more data which is part of
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
what's informing how we go about doing
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
exact L this build so uh I don't I don't
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
believe there's anything confidential or
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
proprietary about what we're providing
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the courts I need to check on that
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
with our chief legal officer but we
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
could provide you a copy of the
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports or direct you to you
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
know so I I think in spirit the concept
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
makes total sense and I want to make
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
sure that you're not you're getting the
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
full spectrum of data regardless of
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's something the courts are
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
requesting so okay so that so that makes
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
me a little uncomfortable I'm trying not
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
to ask for additional information or
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
more work on the
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
part dual use send it to us both so let
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
me answer it this way we haven't
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
determined exactly the format that our
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
reports to the court will take it
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
depends on they they have to ask for
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
specific updates in a in a slightly
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
narrower version than just what we're
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
what we're terming Mission zero and so
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
the answer is we can provide you with
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
exactly the same data that we provide to
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
the courts and I also want you to be
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
aware of some of the wider dashboards
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
were doing that they may not be tracking
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
per their judgment as closely all right
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
and and I just had one more one more one
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
more uh would you remind us of the date
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
that the court said we need to be in
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
compliance I think they only gave us a
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
year and that's not really possible and
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
then the other date would be uh in your
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
best projection where do you think we're
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
going to be in compliance are we going
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
to need a total of two years is this a
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
three-year problem what what what are
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
you thinking about when we're going to
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
be in court compliance yeah so can you
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
even answer that because of I can't
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
really answer the second one just
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
because I think we have to be very
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
careful what we say publicly relative to
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing litigation what I can say is the
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
and this is of course public the the
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
agreement that was come to um uh set a
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
date of May 2024 so this coming May um
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
and we are doing we're working
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
tirelessly at a at a i I think at a
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
speed and with a level of resources
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
thanks to the legislator's um budget
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and so forth to to do
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
everything we can to get as far as we
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
can so thank you yeah representative
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
Weber I was just visualizing uh
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards graph and
 
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
thinking that uh my My Backdoor
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
statistics would be very helpful as a
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
third line on that graph um because he
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
has the front door statistics the the
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
beds but uh knowing who's waiting by the
 
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
back door to get out uh would also be
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of a metric of how
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing to getting people to be in
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
the right place that's that's entirely
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
Our intention so I be careful I may
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
recruit some of you to be in our data
 
00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:45.549 align:start position:0%
recruit some of you to be in our data
work

00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
group representative
 
00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:50.559 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
comment and a question um comment is I'm
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm delighted that um the 20 bed
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
facility you said is going to go to
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
London Derry that's that is the plan
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
right now they received um prelimin they
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
had to change zoning in this particular
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
industrial area which it was uh
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
unanimously determined at a meeting in
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
December so that the town has been very
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
welcoming by all accounts now they're
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
going through all the permitting and
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
construction and everything and they're
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
on District so okay yeah yeah there's
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
been a couple articles um in the Press
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
about it but it's uh it's been more you
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
know if you're at Town meetings it's
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
been coming up there is it up near the
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
airport you said industrial area don't
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
want to get it wrong but let me send you
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
the um specific uh location I I I I
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't know the geography of L well
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
enough is it closer to his house in
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital is to mine I don't
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
live in I don't think that I can say
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
probably not with
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
confidence um but but yes you get to my
 
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.950 align:start position:0%
confidence um but but yes you get to my
question

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
um expansion of the certified Community
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
me behavioral health clinics um you
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
indicate nine are those County based
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital based or are that I assume
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're geographically disposed yeah
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
they're geographically distributed I I
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually it's looking to see if there's
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
others who who you know it's a there's a
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's a network of them um but whether
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
it falls into county by county I does
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
not okay Chris can more history so I was
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
wondering if one County was getting left
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
out or
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
something Chris santinello associate
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner our Mental Health Centers
 
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
have a catchment area that roughly
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
follows our district office catchman
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
area so some some are County some cross
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
count line some are multiple
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
counties now there's are there still 11
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead Miss sure uh there's when I was
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
with the Department there were 11
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
district offices so are there still 11
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
catchman areas there's 10 but 10 Mental
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
Health Centers 11 district offices okay
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
so which area isn't being covered based
 
00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:49.549 align:start position:0%
so which area isn't being covered based
on

00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll have to look at it because I
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
think some of the some of the district
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
offices there may be more than one in a
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
geographic area oh okay right um by the
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
way that gave me a second to look up the
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
location for the five first five bed
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
property which is Newport by the way the
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
second one um hasn't is still in
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
negotiations but Newport will be the
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
first one for that additional um five
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
y thank
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%

fenny

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
fenny
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay um good morning thank you very much
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
for um giving us time this morning to
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
report on the Medicaid adult dental
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
benefits as it stands today almost one
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
year into the program um if you look at
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
the handout uh page two we can start
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
with um service utilization and
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
administration I'm happy to say that
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
between April 1st and today we have
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
served um just shy of 11,000 unique
 
00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.950 align:start position:0%
served um just shy of 11,000 unique
members

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and then the the chart to the left
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
shows our claims counts and the members
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
seen counts by month I will caution that
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
January and February we still have um a
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
runout time so I would look at those
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
numbers with a grain of salt those will
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
definitely change by the next time um we
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
have a report for you and will
 
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
increase we have seen um a steady
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of uh uh claims
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing and the number of
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
members seen which I'm very happy about
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
um in particular we have had 26 denture
 
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
services delivered between April 1st and
 
00:47:02.359 --> 00:47:03.390 align:start position:0%
services delivered between April 1st and
December

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
December
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
31st what that means is that um any
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
individual either denture a full denture
 
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
or partial denture counts as one service
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
so for example if someone had a full
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
upper denture as well as a full lower
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
denture those would actually be two
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
Services um and as I had mentioned in uh
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
previous reports
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to slowly see more and more
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
of those um Services provided that is
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
not something that's one simple
 
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
appointment there's a number of
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
appointments um between start and finish
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
of the service and when the claim
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
actually comes in so there again there
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
is a bit of a lag between the time um
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
that the plan was implemented and we see
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
in um moving on to uh our Network
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
dashboard as of mid February we have 160
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
unique providers in 109
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
locations out of those 160 unique
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
providers we have 21 unique oral
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
surgeons in 20 unique locations which is
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
is very
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
significant also included in that um
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
count of 160 unique providers are 44
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
unique providers who are in Border
 
00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
unique providers who are in Border
community

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
which are actually um closer
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
geographically sometimes for our members
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
to receive services and that is why
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
we've chosen to include them in the
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
network so there are 44 unique providers
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
at 24 unique locations and those are you
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
know being
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
used um the county breakdown to the
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
right will show you that you know there
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
are some areas where there are lower
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
numbers of providers and we are actively
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting in those areas um you'll ALS
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
also see when we talk about the mobile
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
service events that we're targeting the
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
areas with the lowest um number of
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
providers obviously because that's where
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
the support is needed um the following
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
pages will show uh the growth that we've
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
had in the network so going back to
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
November we were at 147 providers July
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
131 and then back as we were getting
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
ready to go in March only 66 so there
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
has been consistent growth um during the
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
last 10 months uh recruitment continues
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
that has never stopped um as well as um
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
the recruiters are now circling back
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
with the providers who are already in
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
network to see if they're at a point in
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
time where they may be able to increase
 
00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:45.230 align:start position:0%
time where they may be able to increase
the

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
utilization um in their offices and
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully um staffing issues have
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
improved and they are more able to see
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
um additional members for
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
us and then the last um chart shows you
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
the mobile dental clinics that were
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the month of February
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the visit at New London
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
Hospital had to be postponed into March
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
just due to um getting everything set
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
and in place with agreements there but
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
rescheduled um the visit last weekend to
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
lree heal lampre healthc care was very
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
successful 26 members were treated um in
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
the two days that they were there um and
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
then there are additional clinics coming
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
up this weekend I do not have the March
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
schedule as yet um they really don't
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
like to share that with us until they
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
have things
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
solidified um all of these events are
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
well uh received um solve air Health who
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
runs the mobile clinics has a dedicated
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
phone line um for individuals to call to
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
make appointments for each of the
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
clinics so that is One telephone number
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and they do not have to you know they
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
can simply ask when is the next event at
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
such and such a location and they're
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
able to book appointments in advance and
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
Sol a healthare is also keeping waiting
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
lists because um you know as happens
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
people do cancel appointments they want
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
to have a waiting list to go to so that
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
the time that they are in those
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
locations is well used so they do um use
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
waiting lists uh to make sure that their
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
schedule is
 
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
full um March visits are coming up as I
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
said in chesher County Sullivan County
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
and also out on the Sea Coast and we are
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on a weekly basis
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
looking at where are we finding that
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
there are needs um we are making
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
connections with people across the state
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
who feel that they may be in an area
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
that mobile services would work well for
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
and so um it's an everchanging schedule
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
these events are not meant to be oneand
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
done they are meant to be um a
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
consistent source of care for the folks
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
who are in those areas and so there are
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
repeat visits back to the same locations
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to make sure that
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
there is some continuity for
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
care um and then you know we have some
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
upcoming reporting uh targeting for May
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh where we'll look at service
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
statistics and other Milestones um and
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
then June will be some financial
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
reporting that we can do once we have um
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
at you know actually concluded one solid
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
year of um function so I'll be happy to
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
answer any questions question from the
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
chair uh the continued growth of
 
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
providers from 66 to 131 147 160 um do
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
you have some people in the pipeline
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
that aren't officially providers yet but
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking like they're going to be
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
yes we and I'm thank you for bringing
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
that up um as we speak there's probably
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere between four to six um
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
providers who are in credentialing and
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
so you know we are seeing changes on a
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
weekly basis um that you know there's
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
always someone in the pipeline could you
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
speak to the question of how many if any
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
have signed on and then chosen not to
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
continue I don't have an absolute answer
 
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
I can't give you a number today there
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
there have been a few but I if you would
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
like I can certainly find out exactly
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had around um the
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
the challenges we would have if patients
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
became no shows or were late and uh and
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
that that could really
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
undermine um the satisfaction action
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
with the the provider satisfaction with
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
the program and we talked about some
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
things to
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
reduce um no shows and so it so this bar
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
graph makes me wonder uh if we have data
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
on no shows uh that might be an
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to track I don't know
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
if you track it but I I I'm curious
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
about it we do have a a way to track it
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
um that is not something specifically on
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
any of our metrics that we do on a
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
regular basis but I can certainly um
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
prepare something for you all to show I
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
mean you know part of the way that we're
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with this for example with the
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
mobile events they do con confirm
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
appointments the day before and they use
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
text voicemail you know whatever method
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that is very helpful
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that uh the
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
dentists are reporting to D Quest when
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
there are late cancellations and no
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
shows and they are tracking that um I
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
think that we have noticed that having
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
the transportation available um has
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
helped I think that is is definitely
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
doing what we anticipated that it would
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
do that's one less reason why someone
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
might cancel an appointment and then the
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
other thing is that there is the Care
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
Management piece so the what management
 
00:56:24.029 --> 00:56:24.039 align:start position:0%
Care Management okay so if a dental
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
office reports say you know two or three
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
times the same person is either you know
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
late cancelled late or not shown dqu is
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
reaching out with their care managers
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
and having a conversation with those
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
individuals to try to get at the reason
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
why they have had you know multiple
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
issues with getting to an appointment
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
and to try to bring some type of
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
resolution because you know we not only
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
want the members to get the care they
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
need we want to make sure that the
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
provider's time is used efficiently
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
right follow up follow up is this two or
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
three this is we're still on we're about
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
to do one B now follow one okay I'm on
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
one B got it so um got that so obviously
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
we're not uh uh reimbursing a tremendous
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
amount and so there's already some um
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
self-sacrifice by the providers taking
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
these patients because the reimbursement
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
is pretty low it the no-show aspect of
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
it can really under mind the
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the program and so I I
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
just thought you you know for that
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
reason alone it may be worth track and
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
that that's me commenting on what you
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
just said you actually if I can sort of
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
digress slightly to address um rates we
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
have been working with our actuaries to
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
do an analysis to really see where New
 
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid adult Dental fee
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
schedule sits Now versus the commercial
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
market and uh we're basically
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursing at approximately 78% of
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
much were we were at we were at 48%
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the rate increases okay good
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's not 72 72% I'm sorry not 7 see
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
you've already got her down six more
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay so that completes one but uh so the
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
second one gets into uh and it's related
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the first one and
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
are we anticipating doing any provider
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
surveys where we kind of randomly
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
anonymously find out what their
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
satisfaction with this this program is
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we can identify issues ahead of
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
time to remediate before they're they a
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
problem um yes that is actually um part
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
of the contract there is there is a
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
survey of providers as well as members
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
because again we want to see both sides
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
out outstanding and that okay so uh I'm
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
on page three and I'm I'm looking at
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
this page and I think last month or
 
00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:07.039 align:start position:0%
whenever I was here with you last we
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
looked at this table to the right and uh
 
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about possibly
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
using a management by exception
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
technique to where you could highlight
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
or color or put an arrow next to uh any
 
00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
areas any Geographic traff areas that
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
you are are are considering problematic
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know that sometimes people use this
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
red yellow green technique to indicate
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
the greens are okay the reds are a
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
problem I mean I I I just would like to
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
see how we're doing and and with that
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
Geographic breakdown I'd be curious uh
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
about specialty shortages I I I see that
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
this chart has broken down into like
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
general dentistry and oral surgery is
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
there is there like a third or fourth
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
specialty you're keeping an eye on like
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't know where orthodonics is is
 
01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
that that's oral children's benefit
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
there is no that's the children's
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
benefit there's no Orthodontics included
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
for the adult Dental benefit I thought
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
for the old people we we had
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
Orthodontics that we authorized in hp2
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
well denture we have Dentures orth
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
Orthodontics is the tooth movement you
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
know braces okay so that we cover up to
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
age 21 so that's and the children's
 
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
benefit um the way this benefit is set
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
up today yeah um oral surgeons are
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
really the only specialty that we are
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
enrolling um we do not cover root canals
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
so there are no idonis that are included
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
and we have very limited
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
periodontal um Services there are
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
services that can be covered by um
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist so we don't we don't
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
have enrollments for periodontis should
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
that ever change in the benefit you know
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
the coverage should ever change then we
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
would start to track those
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
Specialties follow up follow up to three
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay so so under the management by
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
exception uh principle if we if I could
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
see some sort of geographic where we
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
concerned and if you have specialty
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
concerns you highlight those I I I think
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's been some
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
issues with I will be happy to update
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
this graph and share that with the
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee okay um it's not it's not
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
obviously urgent I wouldn't go back and
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
re-engineer your this document it will
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
not take very long to do that I'd be
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
happy to do so and then followup follow
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
this followup I'm getting close to five
 
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
oh we ski yeah so uh CU I crammed two
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
into one so to beat your buzzer we
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um okay on slide
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
seven um so I love the concept of these
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
mobile dental clinics okay but the
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
business guy in me H looks at this and I
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
can't help but Wonder uh what a profit
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
and loss on the mobile van approach
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
would look like and who's covering you
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
know the operating costs uh of the van
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
and and later in a budget cycle if it's
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
the state that's paying for all these
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
mobile we have a lot of different mobile
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
things and and and and and I've always
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
I've always kind of uh um been a little
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
bit concerned about how these mobile
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
capabilities are spread in a stove pip
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
like manner throughout the DHHS budget
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
and this one's important but to are you
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
keeping track of these as a as a these
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
mobile services are part of the contract
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the state holds with nor Northeast
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
Delta Dental and then their
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
subcontractor Dent Quest so it's
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
included in that that contract it's not
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
outside of that so we don't have our own
 
01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
Fleet that we're sending no we don't uh
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
and I have to say solare healthc care
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
has probably one of the most outstanding
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
fleets of mobile services and not just
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
for for dental in other states they
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
provide other mobile services and part
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
of what goes into the planning for these
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
events and what makes it a little bit
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
more difficult than just you know
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
putting names and places down on
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
calendar is that they are strategically
 
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
looking at where do we have the truck
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
this week where are we going to next
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
week and how can we also start to expand
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
the number of days that we're doing
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
services for that reason obviously they
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
have to look at their bottom line that
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
they're not you know going from the
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
north to the south and east to the west
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
and any way haphazardly so so we've been
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
working together for a year and a half
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say how how how much
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
I've appreciated you building this
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
program and executing it so well and I
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your questions here today
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank or your answers my I love my
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
questions but I really liked your
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
answers we appreciate your support we
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't we couldn't be here today
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
without all of you supporting this so
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you all right representative
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair uh going back
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
to page number three for those of us on
 
01:04:21.269 --> 01:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
the west
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
coast um I'm I'm looking at the five
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
locations in chesher but I'm also
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
noticing the
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
um what was it eight locations in
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
Windsor County Vermont and I'm wondering
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
where those are because as I think about
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
Windsor County Vermont I'm trying to
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
figure out how it has more Dental
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
locations than we do uh but I I where
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
are those if you know and if you don't
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
know if you could just send them in that
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful I don't off hand
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
I will absolutely um send those
 
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
I will absolutely um send those
representative

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.670 align:start position:0%
representative
Merchant

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
two when you talk about claims
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
paid you talked about upper dentures and
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
lower Dentures would that be one claim
 
01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to is that's two
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
claims how do we separate the claims
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
from Services because if a claim has
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
multiple services in it or is each claim
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
a separate service for um a service such
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
as a denture there is only one claim
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
that comes in even though there could be
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
five or six visits to accomplish that
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
and there's a very there's a unique code
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
for each type of prosthesis and so we
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
are able to pull that data so that's how
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
we arrived at that number so I follow up
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
so I understand this
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
correctly there's the visit and a claim
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
could actually include multiple visits
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
correct so this doesn't attract visits
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
this tracks CL for a Ure and each
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
insurer has their own there are some
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
insurers that say you can send in a in
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
the claim the day that you do the first
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
visit others do not want to claim until
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
the prosthesis has been delivered thank
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
you so you're
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
welcome uh yes uh follow up please on
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
and did I understand correctly that you
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
said earlier that uh upper and lower
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
Dentures are two claims so what we have
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
delivered to date are 26 separate
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
correct uppers or lowers so maybe 13
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
people but maybe more and there could be
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
some partials in there know but we we
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
take out it just it just gives me a
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
clearer idea of the scope of what we've
 
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
managed so thank you very much for that
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um I
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
I I notice and and I I know the answer I
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
think um in looking at page two in the
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
bar graph um there were more claim is
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
paid each month the member seen and I'm
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
assuming that's because of the B billing
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
cycle and paying for previous months um
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
what's the turnaround time if if I may
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
ask a two-part question what's the
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
turnaround time uh once you once the
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
state is build and the payment goes out
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
is it like a 30-day cycle or no it's
 
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
actually faster than that um I believe
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
that dent Quest is processing claims
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
within a week oh and then you know the
 
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
payment cycle I don't know exactly how
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
that falls but it is relative quick if I
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
may make a comment that that's a great
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
incentive for providers to want to do
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
business with us too so great thank you
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
this so now I'm wondering if I have um I
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
was making an assumption on that graph
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
that uh the numbers seen in the claims
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
paid that the reason that the claims
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
paid were larger was that some members
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
had been seen for two different
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
procedures corre is that why that is
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
correct that's the other thing other
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
than the lag that we were already
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
talking about now someone who's coming
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
in say their first visit you know
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
February 1st could have been for an exam
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
X-rays and cleaning they come back two
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
weeks later have some fillings done
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
those are going to be two distinct
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
different claims so great yeah that's
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking it meant but I
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure I think I know the answer to
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
this but this will set up question um
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
under County breakdowns these are New
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens but their provider is
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
across the border yes right and
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
comparing the since I'm from
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and even moving here
 
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
didn't get far north of the Border um
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm noticing of course a lot of people
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
in Middle sex County Massachusetts
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
because simply there's low there's major
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
population people just south of um Mid
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
middle well in Middle sex County and
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
Essex County but when we come to
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
Worcester County which is very populated
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
it is not populated on the northern
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
border in fact middle SE County goes
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
this way so you don't start being in
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
Worcester County until you're in um
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
Ashburnham and then off to winchington
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
and those are low population places in
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts AB buding new whip switch
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and low population places
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
there which is why the big disparity
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
between the numbers in Massachusetts
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
seen people exactly and as you brought
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
up you know middle sex people can get
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
495 and then right off of there for
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
visit so it is for folks who live in the
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state that is
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
accessible good thank you any other
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much we'll see
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
right and the chair
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh Christine santinello to
 
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
substitute insute from Melissa Hardy uh
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
on the DD ABD weightless quarterly
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
report did you want the sorry there's
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
Henry Lipman still there if you you came
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
getting the hook to do well you know
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
we've been so wanting to see Dr Finny
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes that I'm sorry that's okay um I'm
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not offended that's what you're
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
talking about yes um I also have um if
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
you if you're interested uh a financial
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
piece on on granted advantage
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
um that I didn't send out in advance it
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
just got finished last night but uh if
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
you if you have room for that or I can
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
just make this short
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
too why don't we make it short and make
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
us beg you for more and then send us
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
stuff okay email okay sure so um and I
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
also apologize that I in the rush of
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting things out on time I missed
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
putting page numbers on here so I'm
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
going to go slow to make sure I don't
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
lose anybody on on that end but you got
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
us Mr ch's business card so thank you
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
did and and if you look on your PDF
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see the page numbers uh on the in
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
the pdf version you should also have uh
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
Sarah's presentation in a PDF format
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
that gives you colorcoded stuff so a
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
little easier to look at um but um so in
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the overall enrollment um as
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
of uh this past Monday um we stood you
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
individuals which um is still a bit
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
above where we were in March of 2020 um
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we have through the
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
unwind um enrollment has gone down um
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
684936382 higher than I thought it was
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to be but I think it may be a
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
function of how we structured the unwind
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
when we come up again to the beginning
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
of a year which will be you know April 1
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know I think more of the granted
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
Advantage people were earlier in the
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
unwind so we may see that the other
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
phenomena phenomena I am seeing is that
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
um with people who have disabilities um
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
that have not yet been certified by
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
either Social Security or by the
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
department that granted Advantage um is
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
a stopping point what uh until their say
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
waiver or disability determination is
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
done so I think we're seeing a little
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
bit more of that in terms of our
 
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.550 align:start position:0%
bit more of that in terms of our
enrollment

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
um uh you know a couple of uh things
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
that um aren't on this page and aren't
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the deck that I'd like to
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
just um speak to is um you know just
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
sort of application processing in terms
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
of from a standpoint um later in the
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
deck you'll see a slide that's on exp
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
parte which means that the state has
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
enough um information to process it on
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
it on its own um and um one of the
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
things that we've been analyzing is what
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh what we've been able to do in the
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
more complicated areas of expart the the
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
people who have to Pro proove income and
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know might have a trust or whatever
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
you and that um I think we've seen um in
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
the Home and Community Based area that
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
last few months we've had almost 72% of
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
the Home and Community Based um
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
applications we have enough information
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
to process on which means a higher level
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
of retention and I'll show you the
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
retention that we've seen more recently
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
and in the nursing facility area it's
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's almost
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
48% um so I think there's some good
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
progress being made there we still are a
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
bit challenge I think right now in terms
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
of the fact that the unwind was
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
structured to you know do more of the
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
more difficult one once towards the end
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
so that we had enough experience and
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
that these people were more likely to
 
01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.310 align:start position:0%
that these people were more likely to
retain

01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
coverage um the next uh slide is just a
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
a trend and um not really trying to make
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
a point here but just trying to share a
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
longer term Trend in enrollment uh with
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities and then the slide after
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
that is titled trended disabled children
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
in home Home Care again I think that you
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
know well before the unwind going back
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
to 15 we've seen a slope and later on
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
you'll also see some slides about what's
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire's child
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
population is lower than it was uh over
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
time you see that in school enrollment
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
as well um the the next slide actually
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
which has a number on it now Slide Five
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
um is uh the uh what's happened with the
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
children again the was a wellestablished
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
trend pre pandemic um uh if you go back
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
to the first slide that we looked at um
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
on enrollment you'll see that I think in
 
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of categories declines are sort of
 
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
stabilizing and we're seeing a slight
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
increase part of that for children is
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to be that effective gener one
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
children now um under 19 years of age
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a year of continuous enrollment
 
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
irrespective of of changes and
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances we also have the
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage that was adopted by
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature which women now who have
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
more than 60 days they now have a year
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
for that and then uh the third one that
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
was approved was um uh people who are
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
legally residing the mothers and and
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
children there so that's not a very big
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
group but but the first two are larger
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh children in particular um slide six
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh has uh
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
you know just a trend in in children um
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
shown that we pulled from some
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
statistics there just to back up a
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
little bit of the discussion earlier um
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know a positive sign I see is that
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
um on slide seven is that there are
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
fewer people with that are below the
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
300% of poverty New Hampshire has the
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
fifth highest meaning the fifth most
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
generous um eligibility level for
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
children uh we go up to 323 per of
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
poverty um and national average is like
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
2117 um so you know I think that New
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has always prioritized
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
children um in in Medicaid coverage that
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
goes you know long before my
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
time um and also you know looking at
 
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
slide eight this is just looking at 400%
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
where these you know we're seeing an
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
increase in our state population of
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
people with higher incomes bouncing out
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
of the you know the the pandemic
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
period um slide SL nine um is just
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
basically what we describe as our um
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
unwind strategy and I won't go over this
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
slide in detail but um slide
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
10 is a a chart or dashboard for what we
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
call the protected population this was
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
the original almost 104,000 people that
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
had U because of the public health
 
01:17:20.189 --> 01:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
emergency had continuous coverage some
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
as long as three years um and that if
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
you look on the far right at top the
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
remaining future redes redeterminations
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be done in this group is only 102 um
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we're we're pretty much done um with
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
that and you can see on the bottom left
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
the number one reason for closure was
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
redetermined if you you would like to to
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
see that um
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
on page 11 I which is the percentage
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
page i' point out that for for
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
individuals who um didn't redetermining
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
the month they were due that we see a
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
lot of them coming back within 30 days
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
um some 60 and up to 90 we actually
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
allow up to 120 days without having to
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
file a new application as a part of the
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility um the on slide 12 is the
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
the children um and there you can see we
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
completely worked through the protected
 
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.669 align:start position:0%
completely worked through the protected
population

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
there again on the bottom left uh income
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
was the number one reason that children
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
did not retain
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
coverage um the next slide 13 is the
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
longterm care um disabled that's again
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
we try to go slower with this group and
 
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
we're still going slow because these
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
people need a lot more time and help to
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
to get through the process because often
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
times if you're dealing with was a
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
family member who might have Alzheimer's
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
or something that you know that the
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
family has to to to help and sometimes
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know we do need documentation that's
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
hard to get to um again number one
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
reason for for not retaining coverage is
 
01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
reason for for not retaining coverage is
is

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
income um I think this following slide
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
where I lost my page number which I
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
think is slide 14 by count um is the
 
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
analysis we did based on what was in the
 
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
news back a few months where New
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was they talked about children
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
losing coverage in New Hampshire and we
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
did um they Define children as between
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
zero and 23 as the federal government
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
did the reason they did that is because
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
certain kids aged out of being a kid
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
during that time and also some um like
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
foster care have coverage longer so but
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
what we looked at here was um you know
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
using the same analytic framework that
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
the the federal government did is uh we
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
broke it down between the protected and
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
nonprotected but of the the nonprotected
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
which uh the the general this is the
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
first time they're coming up for re
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
redetermination um
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
84.7% retain coverage um
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
1.8% um found coverage because maybe
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
they were 19 now could get go to granted
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh 3% went to other and
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
13.3% closed
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
and for those that Clos the number one
 
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
reason again was
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
income um when you look at the protected
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
population these are individuals that
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
have been protected for up to three
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
years that you know 48.2% of those
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
closed again when you look at the number
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
one reason its income um almost half is
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
just income related you know 13.3% was
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
either they weren't requesting or that
 
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
they had a change in circumstances and
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
where family income may change um one
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
house one person household adult versus
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
a two person adult would be an example
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
um those a number that were
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
categorically un eligible as well but I
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
think the takeaway from this slide are
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
two things is one that every every
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
slide could we stop that for a question
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
on this particular slide
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
please I just wanted to make sure I was
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
understanding the term remained to
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
children so have we is is the point of
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
calling them remain
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
children reflecting the fact that kids
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
who simply aged out of being eligible
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
are not included in this no this would
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
be anybody as of March 1st of
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
2023 which was the month that the unwind
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
started if you will okay that that
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fixed population looking at
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
where they stood um as of this analysis
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
was as of December that this was the
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
outcome for all these individuals so
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay so remain children is just a term
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
for the kids who started in started the
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
starting number right and and so this
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
also includes individuals who may be 23
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
right I understand the B the point about
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
the the definition of what a child was I
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
just the term remained children are two
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
words that I'm having trouble putting
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
together and making sense of so maybe if
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
I could restate it is that as of March 1
 
01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.550 align:start position:0%
I could restate it is that as of March 1
of

01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
2023 yep everybody on this page was
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
either was between Zer and 23 years of
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
age okay thank you very much that helps
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing on WE we've done
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of Outreach efforts but
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
we made a special effort um to call
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
every single person who failed to
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
redetermined to finish their
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
redetermination uh made attempts either
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
through the department or the MOs or um
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
we provided list to Providers um
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know we're also working with the
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
mental health centers now in terms of
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
what more we can do to to help them um
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
they've been hit in two ways one they
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
have a challenging population when they
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
have a severe mental illness the second
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
is a lot of the In-N-Out Medicaid that
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
had continuous coverage for three years
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
now have to approve their every month
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
could I ask a followup followup um so if
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
I were looking for the numbers of the
 
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who aged out based on that
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
up to 23 would that categorically would
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
they come up under categorically
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
ineligible now or where are the numbers
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the kids who simply aged out here so
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
I'd have to give you something different
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
this was just looking at a the cohort as
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
of March 1 who fit into that category
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
but we do have that you um we do have
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
that information I could do a followup
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
for you on
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
that okay so now I'm really confused
 
01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
that okay so now I'm really confused
because

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
I had assumed that this
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
was overtime but what this is is just a
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
snapshot SN on that day and what had
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
happened up to that day correct okay I'm
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I was thinking about it going
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
forward so all is much clearer now thank
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
you we were trying to line up our
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
analysis with the fed's analysis to of
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
course representative Merchant thank you
 
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Miss lippin for
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.070 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
under Granite advantage and also looking
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
children help me understand I guess I
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
was misunderstanding
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
potentially aren't all people who are in
 
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid under granded advantage or do
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
we have separate buckets between those
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
who are in granted Advantage versus the
 
01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicaid Program so there
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
are a lot of different eligibility
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
categories so children would typically
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
be in children's Med you can't be in
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage if you're um under 19
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
years of age granted Advantage is 19 to
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
64 granted Advantage is just a um an
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
adult it's it's a I guess the term of
 
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
art is
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
um adults that are are uh income only
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
based their eligibility based on their
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
followup in regards to the Granite
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
Advantage then it's adult program only
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's not for children correct so
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
therefore if somebody's in a age 19 or
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
less or under 19 do they go for the
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicaid Program um FIFA
 
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
service versus a Medicaid HMO so um
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
we're predominantly a manag Managed Care
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
State almost 90 99% 98 we have only
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
about 2,000 individuals that are for
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
have some basis to not be included in
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
Managed Care um
 
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
that are special populations by federal
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
designation but basically children
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
typically would get their eligibility in
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
the children's categories either um
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
low-income children or chip children
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
which are allows the the income of the
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
the child's family to go up to 323 per
 
01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.629 align:start position:0%
the child's family to go up to 323 per
of

01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
poverty I'm sorry I need to go back one
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
more time okay one more time I'm really
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
sorry but the more I look at this chart
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
the more bewildered I get because what
 
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
it says at the top is the chart below
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
illustrates the number of children that
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
were eligible in Medicaid at the
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of their unwind and their
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
current status
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
yes and then there is a an
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
asterisk um which says statuses of 28
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
2024 yes
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we looked at that so the whole thing
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
is their status yes if you were out so
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
the stat it's not a so it's not a
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
snapshot as of March 1st it's where the
 
01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
March first people are now yes you got
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
it right okay I'm sorry if that wasn't
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
clear no no no no no I I think I'm being
 
01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
particularly fuzzy it's been a long week
 
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to pick up the pace
 
01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit because of several other
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
agenda items I'll take 30 seconds to
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
finish the rest that'll be wonderful
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
page 15 is just the positive trend in X
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
parte renewal rates um I'll skip page 16
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
because it's just basically um and I'll
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
just jump you ahead to
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh page what would be page 17 CMS
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
reporting and closure reasons cumulative
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'm G to just once you find that
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
page I'm just going to go one more and
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
just talk about what happened in January
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and then I'll stop talking um so the
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
reporting here if you will the flesh
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
tone color is the percentage of people
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
um both protected and regular renewals
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
that retained coverage in January and
 
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
basically we saw record retention of
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
coverage at 94% overall 94 um and you
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
can see that
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
01:28:25.109 --> 01:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look at other slides
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
in this deck that you know we've we've
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
as we've gone through the unwind as
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
expected that we the people we most
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
likely expected to retain coverage we
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
put them towards the back because it
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
made sense to not try to to uh take take
 
01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
them on if you will until after um after
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
we had done the people that we knew were
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
likely not to be eligible um and I'll
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
stop there I have U some Financial
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
material I can leave with you and also
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
send to you or just send it to you if
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's your
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
preference it's a long-term snapshot on
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
the finances if you've got written
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
materials uh please uh if you would give
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
them to uh representative Murphy and
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
we'll pass them around
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
and you
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
may um o okay so um I I want to ask you
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
about adult eligibility for Medicaid and
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
I got four categories I want to ask you
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
about okay uh and uh I'll take a yes or
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
a no and if you can't answer it in a yes
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
or a no we can talk about it offline to
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
save time okay um under the refugee
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
resettlement program I understand that
 
01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:38.750 align:start position:0%
resettlement program I understand that
those

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
refugees uh are uh covered by
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and any Medicaid costs are
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursable by the federal government
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid cost is that is that
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that a yes or a no it's more
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
complicated than a yes or no okay so so
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll talk offline uh how about
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
those with um a green card who are here
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
and have a green card are are they
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid after five year
 
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
waiting period five years y but there's
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
also a little bit of uh something I
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
could talk to you specialty on that too
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay how about those individuals who are
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
in the country uh seeking political
 
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
Asylum and they're awaiting a
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
hearing generally no generally no like
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
there is emergency Medicaid of someone
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we have to help everyone that
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
shows up in the ER I get that and so so
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
this last category I assume is kind of
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
the same we have to help them in the ERS
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
because it's a compassionate thing to do
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
but those individuals that are in the
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
country without any federal
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
documentation yeah I I think that falls
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
into generally emergency Medicaid but
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
there could be some finer points there
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
that we should talk about okay I I
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
really want to understand this better so
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
can I set up a meeting with you yes I
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
would include someone from the
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility area as well as the Medicaid
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert on this because it
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
is a is a complicated area yeah uh thank
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
you and might you boil it down to a
 
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
onepage answer for the rest of us please
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'll try I'm I'm not as smart as mrman
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
but I'll try that's why I only gave you
 
01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:25.430 align:start position:0%
but I'll try that's why I only gave you
one

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%

much yes all right thank you all so
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
there is a handout in front of you go
 
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
for viewing the DD ABD and inhome
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
supports wait list inform information
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
for quarter 1 and as you review that
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
information we wanted to point out a few
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
pieces of um or a few updates data
 
01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
that's changed and that we collect and
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
how we report and the report that's in
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
front of you so first the utilization of
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lead system
 
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
historically used by the area agencies
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
and the Bureau of Developmental services
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
to track funding requests for
 
01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
individuals in need of services that
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
ceased um ceased at the end of fiscal
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
year 23 so individuals in need of waiver
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
Services beginning fiscal year 24 this
 
01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
last July we were able to capture that
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
data prior to as you may be aware we
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
typically fund individuals about 90 days
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
ahead of time uh once July came around
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
though that information was no longer
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
available so what you're seeing in front
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
of you was a manual uh data collection
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
for the time being as we transition
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
systems as of July 1st though our area
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
agencies began using New Hampshire easy
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
um our information technology system to
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
represent those ongoing funding
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
needs also as of July 1st
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
2023 we have stopped identifying in
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
including information around folks that
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
we previously represented as a c or we
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
also referred to those as
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
enhancements um these requests are now
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
submitted as they're needed and they are
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
reviewed and funded in addition as those
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
requests come through so no longer a
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
waiting time period until funds are
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
distributed to the the other groups that
 
01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
in addition the information in front of
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
you due to the transfer to the New
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Easy System the delay reasons
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
that were previously reported are no
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
longer reflected within this report and
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's an interim process or an interm
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
um data metric that's not included as
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
that would have been because that
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
information was no longer available we
 
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't automatically transfer that
 
01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:48.679 align:start position:0%
information so rather than asking our
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
partners at our area agencies and our
 
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
Service Coordination agencies to input
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
that data manually um we instead focused
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
on authorizing service authorizations
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
and ask for the resources to be directed
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
in those areas um in the future though
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
that data will continue to come through
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
as these new requests are being added
 
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
that information is also being added in
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
addition to the funding amount uh any
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
delay reasons that might present after
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
someone receives their funding we do
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
have meetings weekly with our Service
 
01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
Coordination agencies which also incl
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
clud our area agency partners who offer
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
Service Coordination Services where we
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
talk about what these delay reasons
 
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
might be um as you may see on page three
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
of the report the the number one reasons
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
are limited capacity of staff and the
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
workforce short shortage so additionally
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
we have bi-weekly meetings with service
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
provider agencies which also include
 
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
many of our area agency partners who
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
offer Direct Services and many other of
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
our private providers out in the state
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
where we talk about various issues that
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
might be impacting service availability
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
and when Services can begin for
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
individuals who've been funded so we're
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
trying to continue communication while
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're working on restoring uh that data
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
that was previously tracked in New
 
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.070 align:start position:0%
that was previously tracked in New
Hampshire

01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
leads yes and that is all manually
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
tabulated on both ends manually entered
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
and manually pulled for this time period
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
until we move to that still again
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
manually entered with the funding
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
requests but then we should have that
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
information available with the
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
poll representative Weber so am I
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
correct in thinking that these are
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
simply the new individuals during the
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
quarter and that we also have a
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
significant backup of people from
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
earlier quarters that are also receiving
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
either partial or no Services yes I
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
would say that's accurate folks who have
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
received the funding but haven't yet
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
been able to start their services right
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
at some point it would be useful to know
 
01:37:55.629 --> 01:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
the global numbers rather than just I
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
mean the quarter numbers are helpful but
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
the global numbers would also be useful
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards uh
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and welcome uh one
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the longstanding questions to your
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
your counterpart was or your your your
 
01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
predecessor rather was uh has been uh
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
the state is obligated to fund 100% of
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
those that need need DD support um there
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
has been an issue of not everyone being
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
able to get those Services because lack
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
of providers or whatever and so I've
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
always wanted to know uh what the what
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
the number is that have been fully
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
funded but have not yet uh been able to
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
get the services they need and and maybe
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's you know uh should be broken down
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
between zero services and partial
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
services and fully serviced and I I
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
think this t a couple of these tables a
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
couple of these tables get close to that
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so that gives me hope that maybe
 
01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
that we can do this but if if you can
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
give it to me after a year and a half of
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
asking for it you would be a hero or a
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
heroin what you get to pick your pronoun
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
okay I I think that that is the goal
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
utilizing New Hampshire easy is to be
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
able to track that data in a meaningful
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
way moving forward the the total
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
universe and not just by quarter and not
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
based on manual polls and calculation
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
but to have a systematic way to go
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
forward and watch that because it really
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
does speak to Quality access of services
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to our obligations and our
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to fund as well but
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
really getting to the heart of our folks
 
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
getting Services thank you do you have
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
any statistics or even some good anec
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
doal stories as to how each Area Agency
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
believes itself to be fully staffed for
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
the demands made on it that we could
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
see yeah I I wouldn't want to speak for
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
the area agencies but I think similar to
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
what a lot of our other provider
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
agencies inclusive of area agencies have
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
reported um around Staffing concerns and
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
considerations and trying to make sure
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
they have as many as many staff
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
available as necessary to fully support
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
individuals and to continue to offer
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
services to new individuals whose needs
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
might arise and I wouldn't ask you to
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
speak for for them but I would ask you
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
to take what they spoke for themselves
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
to you and collate it so it's all on one
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
page and I don't have to make 10 phone
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
calls I I would say that their feeling
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
would be similar um to our other
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
provider area excuse me provider
 
01:40:50.350 --> 01:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
agencies and other service sectors that
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know we certainly are working
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
through a pretty critical shortage of
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
Staff within the state it took me a year
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
and a half for the wellness center that
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
I supervise to get another family
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
practice physician and certified
 
01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
counselor a year and a half so I get it
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
i' just like to know how bad it is and
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
is there an area or two where it is much
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
worse than other places I just want to
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a state picture yeah generally
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
speaking I think in the northern area of
 
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:21.639 align:start position:0%
our state we've heard you know different
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
concerns around Staffing that also tie
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
to various other things that we've even
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
heard discussed here by other colleagues
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
within the department around
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
transportation and and those concerns
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
for not just the individuals we support
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
but also the providers who are offering
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
those Services um the Western area of
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
our state as well has has mentioned
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
similar concerns in that area uh for
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
similar reasons and then of course other
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
things other areas that we're looking to
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
address systematically or systemically
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
rather um we have other opportunities
 
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
too that we're excited about and I think
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner santinello would
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
be able to speak to those as well yeah I
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
think um one of the things the
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
department put out
 
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.390 align:start position:0%
department put out
in

01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
it over the summer early fall was um
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
funding for Home and Community Based
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce initiatives and so it was
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
helping um providers to either come up
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
with retention strategies recruitment
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
strategies and so we issued about 27
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
contracts and we actually are going to
 
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
reissue that um request for Grant Awards
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
to really help some of the providers
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
come up with Creative Solutions to
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
assist them so we'll be getting some
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
data from that as
 
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.270 align:start position:0%
data from that as
well

01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
good representative
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
chairman uh when I was on the Department
 
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire easy was most known for
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
the the to make it possible to apply
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
online for service for an
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
individual uh I get the impression
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
obviously with more more than an
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
impression um it's being used for just
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
about everything for uh any needs uh
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
from agencies and individuals now it's
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
been expanded dramatically is that fair
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
to say yes moving that information into
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
one at a glance system where individuals
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
can access information not only about
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
their Medicaid Eligibility but also
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
those extended services or those waiver
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
services that they may have we really
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
think is a value ad maybe about 10 a
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
little less than 10 years ago our fourth
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
Home and Community Based 1915 sea waiver
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
also integrated into New Hampshire easy
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
with quite a bit of success so we we
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow that model and make
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
sure it was consistent across all four
 
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:37.719 align:start position:0%
of the the Seas as we call them the sea
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
wavers followup uh and individuals are
 
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
still able to apply through New
 
01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%

around in front of you goes over our
 
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
pilot project we're all all sit now I
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
think and we were hoping to give a
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
update to this to this committee so I'll
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
be brief and you know C it certainly
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
take any questions after so our pilot
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
program aimed at um assisting
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
individuals between the ages of 18 and
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
21 could you get closer to the mic yes
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
sorry is that better that is okay so our
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
pilot program aimed at assisting
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
individuals ages 18 to 21 Who are
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
ineligible for the developmental
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities waiver because they're
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
still in school um as you all may recall
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
there was quite a gap in our system to
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
be able to fund those folks so as of
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
this time um we are currently supporting
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
six individuals using that pilot program
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
funding um four of those individuals are
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
receiving residential services and two
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
of those individuals receiving um
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
enhancements to their current inhome
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
supports waiver so that um is a waiver
 
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
that is capped at $35,000 per year so
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
the pilot program is enabling them to
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
receive the additional funding that
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
would help to support them to remain
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
living at home with their
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
families um total cost of services
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
provided so far is around 545 just shy
 
01:46:00.239 --> 01:46:01.189 align:start position:0%
provided so far is around 545 just shy
of

01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
$546,000 so it's been a great help um 12
 
01:46:07.629 --> 01:46:07.639 align:start position:0%
people have applied so far and 11 have
 
01:46:07.639 --> 01:46:08.430 align:start position:0%
people have applied so far and 11 have
been

01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
approved and there was one denial that
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
was determined um as the local
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
educational Authority was financially
 
01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
responsible so the the denial was really
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
because there was another funding source
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
Weber there are 11 who were approved and
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
six who were actually receiving Services
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the other five we
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
have five individuals who have been
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
approved and they're currently looking
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
to receive Services through what we call
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
an enhanced Family Care model where they
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
would move in with a a family who would
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
provide care to them within a family
 
01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:48.679 align:start position:0%
home okay thank you
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Ed Edwards uh
 
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so so this number
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
545,000 jumps out at me for six
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and I I just want to know
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
what all is is included in this 545 is
 
01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
that any employee salaries or anything
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
is this like a fully loaded cost or is
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
this just services that would cover the
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
full cost of services so the provider
 
01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
their staff their operational expenses
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
um whoever that service provider might
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
be to offer those
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
services so in summary this is this is
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
just for services being provided to
 
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
these six people it does not include
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
agency salaries or anything uh salaries
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the providers but not for any not
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
providers for the for
 
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
the for the agency for DHHS oh excuse me
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
no it so I'm just I'm because it just
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
seems like a really high number yes
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
because so much of it is for residential
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
costly could Mr chair could okay we've
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
got a time crunch so one more question
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is a request I I I'd like a a
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown of that 545 just to
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
know per of time that's just a big
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
number we can absolutely provide that
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh now we are going to move on
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
to the last item thank you so much for
 
01:48:19.589 --> 01:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
coming and this is um Senate Bill 118 of
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
2019 child fatality Review Committee

01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
and while we're do getting ready for
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
this if Christa Morris if you could hang
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
around a little bit after this meeting
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes could you do that yeah
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
and also you I got something I need to
 
01:49:08.189 --> 01:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
talk to the three of us about together
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
the third being Williams no Christa
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
you good morning hey good morning my
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
name is Mark Clement um I'm Co chair of
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
the committee of been child psychologist
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
the retired ameriti faculty from Colby
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
Sawyer college and I still teach
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
parttime at New England College I think
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
because of the time
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
crunch I won't go through my little talk
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
here but I just want to mention uh three
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
things or three general principles about
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
the committee and how we function in our
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
meetings uh first and
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
foremost uh one of the major
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
confidentiality okay every member signs
 
01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
a confidentiality agreement that
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from sharing any
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
information discussed in the review and
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
any non-member who comes to the meeting
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
to share information about the death for
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
example a police officer who might have
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
investigated the death is also required
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
to sign a confidentiality
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
agreement the second thing I think you
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
need to know is that we are not an
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
investigative body we take information
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's brought to the committee by
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and agencies that have to
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
share about the death and lastly we do
 
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
not review any deaths that are presently
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
in litigation or have the possibility of
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
future litigation this is our guidance
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office and
 
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
after all litigation and appeals have
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
been completed we would have the
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review uh those
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
debts so I think with that said um again
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
I I won't go through all of my notes
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
because I know we have a time crunch
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
here and I know you probably have some
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions so if Ronda if you have
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
anything you want to add
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
um sure I'm Rhonda seagull we've met uh
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
several times before I'm the uh section
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
head for the maternal and child health
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
section under which um the oversight of
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
child fatality Review Committee um sits
 
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
I am also a legislated member of uh
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
child fatality review it is a legislated
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
committee um I do want to say that the
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
backbone of any fatality review uh
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
particularly child fatality review are
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that are discussed
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
um at the end um of the committee um
 
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
that is uh the reason that we exist um
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
the recommendations are to hopefully
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
prevent uh future deaths um the report
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you is about
 
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 23 we do not um review
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
all of the child deaths in the state and
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
we pick deaths based on um data uh what
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
the data is showing us the medical
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
examiners office um Etc so for that year
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
we focused in on Motor Vehicle crashes
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
and other land transport such as Farm
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles um we focused on overdose St uh
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
deaths and as well as fire so one of the
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
things that um happens at our review
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
meetings is that uh our c colleagues
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
from across the state uh talk to us
 
01:52:26.109 --> 01:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
about the things they are doing so for
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
instance the Fire Marshal's Office uh
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
presents the data before the meeting and
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
presents um the prevention activities
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
that they're involved with that they
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
lead and they collaborate on um which
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
helps to inform our recommendations
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
afterwards um I do want to say that we
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh have initiated a recommendations uh
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
work Group which is a separate work work
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
Group which looks at the recommendations
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
takes what people say um and then um
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
processes that uh through the lens of
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
are these recommendations feasible uh
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
can we pay for them um will they work in
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh what is done in Vermont
 
01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
it will not necessarily work in uh New
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um as well as you know does
 
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
the community support it who is a
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
champion if there is a recommendation
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh without a champion uh that
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation won't will uh not be
 
01:53:26.079 --> 01:53:27.149 align:start position:0%
recommendation won't will uh not be
likely

01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
likely
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
implemented and uh uh the last is does
 
01:53:34.589 --> 01:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
it have a basis in um in in in science
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
has this evidence or has this um
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
intervention you know smoke alarms uh
 
01:53:44.589 --> 01:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
yes they do uh reduce the uh incidence
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
of of fire deaths um so I just want to
 
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh bring your attention to some of the
 
01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations from State fiscal year
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
23 uh which include uh supporting uh uh
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
parental uh uh the parental role of um
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
teens uh with their driving habits um
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
parents have an outsize role at that
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
table um as myself having four children
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
who now are a decade ahead of having
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
driven you know you have to have a
 
01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
certain amount of hour
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh to drive with them um you know this
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
includes the support of affordable
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
driver education uh that parents can pay
 
01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
for and plenty of practice time uh
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
social media is always almost one of our
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations for uh any of the desks
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
that we look at um uh social media
 
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
obviously is is is um is the way that
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
people communicate now um we also uh
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
continue to support uh uh access to data
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
to guide our interventions and reviews
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
including the youth risk behavior
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
survey um which tells us a lot about our
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
Adolescence in the state um this
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
particular talking about overdose you
 
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
hear lockboxes when you uh think about
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
Firearms but lock boxes are also a
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
proven intervention uh for um uh
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
limiting exposure to uh uh medications
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
and other things that children might get
 
01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:25.639 align:start position:0%
into and then the promotion of fire
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
safety um education and all the
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful things that colleagues across
 
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
the state are doing um like the office
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
of Highway Safety the injury prevention
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
center around uh you know teen driving
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh motor vehicle crashes
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
continue to be uh the leading cause of
 
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
death amongst uh New Hampshire's
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
children uh 1 through 21 years of age
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
with um overdose deaths a close
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
second um Dr Clement and I are available
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
have Dr
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
you for the the report here um I always
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
find this report fascinating because of
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers that just are starkly quite
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
large in some areas and one of the
 
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
questions I had was on page eight you
 
01:56:17.229 --> 01:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
talk about newborn affected
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
complications of placenta cord in
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
membranes I'm sorry on page eight eight
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah uh natural causes of infant death
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
so it's 11% 21 um
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
newborns complications of
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
placenta oh with with uh uh yes so
 
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
natural causes of death continue to be
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
the leading cause of death for for for
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
babies for infants under one yes thank
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
you my question was uh do you know where
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
these newborns had this complication are
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
these in hospital home births where did
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
these complications how do you break
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
that down uh when you're talking about
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
newborns affected by complications
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
placenta cord and membranes right so
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
basically at the time of birth you know
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
where do they occur I would have to look
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
further into the data okay thank you the
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
other question I have if I may on page
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
eight um but I suspect that I mean most
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
of our births in the state happen uh at
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
the at uh birthing hospitals not all but
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
I need to look at
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
that I just find that to be a fairly
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
High number they are in hospital births
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's all um on page nine the number of
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
suicides is 168 2% which doesn't
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
surprise me I guess as far as the number
 
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
goes what I am surprised is that the
 
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
method of
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
suicide over nearly half of them a
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
Suffocation nearly half of them of the
 
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
suicides are listed as Suffocation yes I
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
mean that is uh
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you were so the state comes out uh
 
01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
the state Suicide Prevention Council of
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
which um Health and Human Services um
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
also has administrative support over not
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
my section but um Behavioral Health um
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
comes out with a suicide annual report
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's broken down even further in terms
 
01:58:10.589 --> 01:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
of um ages um Suffocation uh generally
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
with with the younger teens uh um
 
01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
there's male female distinction Firearms
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
is usually with older uh older teens so
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
yes does that answer your question no
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
but I just didn't want to get into the
 
01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
details I can find that out I can talk
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
you yeah more yeah yeah
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
asfixiation yes oh if if you mind um my
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
my question is that that seems to me a
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
very high number in a very difficult
 
01:58:47.069 --> 01:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
methodology of suicide and I'm just
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
curious as to how that occurs are you
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
aware of how that occurs or how that
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
occurs yeah Suffocation yeah in terms of
 
01:58:59.069 --> 01:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
hang most of them are are hanging death
 
01:59:01.709 --> 01:59:01.719 align:start position:0%
so that's that's is that what the
 
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
question that's I was going with because
 
01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
yes that's where I was going with that
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you because I you're
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
welcome and we've seen uh access to
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
things that you would not think
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily to put away um dog colors uh
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
I mean leashes uh and the reason that
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
question is that number is so high to me
 
01:59:23.709 --> 01:59:23.719 align:start position:0%
is because in the Press I hear all the
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
time about suicide by Firearms suicide
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
by uh drug overdo but I do not hear the
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
leading cause is listed as Suffocation I
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
just don't hear that that's all thank
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
me people yes as yes representative
 
01:59:44.669 --> 01:59:44.679 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also
 
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question is
 
01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.229 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question is
there

01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:59:48.239 --> 01:59:50.870 align:start position:0%
there
any

01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
way to take this information
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
and correlate that over to what's going
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
on with the children trying to find room
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
in psychiatrical care in other words I'm
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that we have heard
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
earlier at least I did about the
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
challenges we have trying to find a way
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
to help some of the folks get the
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
treatment they need in a psychiatrical
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
situation or a bed if you will in the
 
02:00:17.069 --> 02:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
hospital is there any correlation
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
between that and what's going on here
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
with suicide what's happening because if
 
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
we have suicide going on is it because
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get into a facility to
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
help them with their care they need to
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
prevent it or is that something I'm just
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
going up into a rabbit hole uh no I
 
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
think uh we hope to see that over the
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
years um uh the director of the or the
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
bureau chief for uh children's
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health has presented to us on
 
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
all the things that uh the Deputy
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner talked about this morning
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
and um I don't know
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
to um I would say it's um there's
 
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
obviously relationship in that uh
 
02:01:03.669 --> 02:01:03.679 align:start position:0%
impatient psychiatric care is is
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
critical for youth who are who may not
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
be safe um and pose a risk to sell for
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
others um however if you look at the
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
literature like impatient psychiatric
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
hospitalization at a population level
 
02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:17.719 align:start position:0%
isn't generally a way that has ever been
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
proven to reduce suicide it's very
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
important for many reasons in including
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
keeping people safe and getting them
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate psychiatric care but um more
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
of the efforts that have been talked
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
about by child fatality around things
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
like lethal means reduction um and um
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
more uh early interventions are
 
02:01:39.069 --> 02:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
generally seen as the efficacious
 
02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
population any further questions uh
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
for taking this question I
 
02:01:59.069 --> 02:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering is is there a way of
 
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
breaking down your numbers I'm looking
 
02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
at page five right now and um page I'm
 
02:02:14.109 --> 02:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
five and I'm looking at the suicide
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
number um uh actually it's under injury
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
accident hom homicide suicide and uh the
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
years are 2018 to
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
20122 and I know in um there's there was
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh lot of information out there
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
about suicide going uh going up when
 
02:02:41.709 --> 02:02:41.719 align:start position:0%
covid hit so I was wondering if there's
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
a way of breaking that out to say 2020
 
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
and 2022 to see if there was a
 
02:02:49.950 --> 02:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
relationship of uh
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
isolation um there's always a way of
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
breaking things down but I um as I
