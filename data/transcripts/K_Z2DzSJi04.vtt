00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so for the record I'm
 
00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative Tony lekkis uh
 
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro 38 the towns of
 
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hudson and Litchfield so
 
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.249 align:start position:0%
Hudson and Litchfield so
um

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
cleanup and some minor modifications as
 
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
I presented before
 
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
um there's there was the amendment I
 
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
presented before and the related to
 
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
teacher job sharing
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
Nea lobbyist is looking for an
 
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
additional change which actually makes
 
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
sense that the thing is that uh a lot of
 
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
cases this is uh
 
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know people that have either other
 
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
jobs or they're taking care of kids and
 
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
so how the uh
 
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh the breakdown of who works what hours
 
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
um can vary and the the bill and then
 
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
the initial amendment was 50 50 and it's
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
not always 50 50.
 
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and this the uh you know Marty from the
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems here he said they're
 
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
okay with it they don't want to go too
 
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
far so you know somebody's not working a
 
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
tiny number of hours but uh
 
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think you have a copy of the proposed
 
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
amendment and on this one
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
um what I'd suggest if the committee is
 
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay with it to uh to vote to at least
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
in principle accept this I can get an
 
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted and then when we do
 
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
the exec and the full committee I'll
 
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
have that there if if that's okay
 
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
and then there's the other parts of it
 
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
and I mean I don't have anything to say
 
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
but I'll be glad to answer questions on
 
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Marty's here if you have
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the retirement system but
 
00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
um you know they said it's acceptable
 
00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.030 align:start position:0%
um you know they said it's acceptable
and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
does anybody need to ask any questions
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.309 align:start position:0%
of the
no

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
all right and that being the case I
 
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
don't want to belabor this one too much
 
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
more we've talked about it pretty
 
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.589 align:start position:0%
more we've talked about it pretty
extensively

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I would like to move
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh the adoption of this proposed
 
00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and then move out to pass
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
all right all those in favor
 
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.869 align:start position:0%
all right all those in favor
okay

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill deals with um the
 
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
firefighter Academy we do have an
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
amendment to extend it to the police
 
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
academy as well
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
um did anybody have anything that they
 
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 align:start position:0%
yes representative true
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think I have a problem with including
 
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.790 align:start position:0%
I think I have a problem with including
the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh including the police
 
00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.770 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh including the police
academy

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
academy
 
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.430 align:start position:0%
academy
um

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
the police academy is staffed full-time
 
00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.129 align:start position:0%
the police academy is staffed full-time
um

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned with my limited
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge of uh weakening the retirement
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
system and its funding
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
by allowing
 
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 align:start position:0%
people to come in and work part-time
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
because they'll be working and not
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't think I could I would
 
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
not be able to support the police
 
00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:18.890 align:start position:0%
not be able to support the police
um

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
I have my problems other problems with
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
the bill sure but that that I think is
 
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
my objection with my limited knowledge
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
of how the pension system works uh for
 
00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 align:start position:0%
the amendment to uh to allow the police
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
academy to do the same okay and the
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I know I'm not a
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
member but I'd just like to make a few
 
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.170 align:start position:0%
member but I'd just like to make a few
comments

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
um my concern is with the bill
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear a number of exact number
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
of how many retired firefighters are
 
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.450 align:start position:0%
of how many retired firefighters are
working

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 align:start position:0%
at the Academy
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have figures on how many of
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
those members who are working are up
 
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
against the 24-hour
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
time 26 hour time frame and until we
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
have those numbers no I mean if this
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill is only going to affect
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
we heard there were roughly 75 percent
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighters working at the
 
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 align:start position:0%
Academy 25 percent
 
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.650 align:start position:0%
Academy 25 percent
retirees

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
but we don't have exact numbers as to
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
and if this legislation is only going to
 
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.570 align:start position:0%
and if this legislation is only going to
affect

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.890 align:start position:0%
affect
five

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
ten instructors
 
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
I mean we're passing legislation from
 
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
five or ten people and I'm not sure we
 
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
want to go there versus looking to
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
increase the pool of
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
instructors they have up there so I mean
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
until we get those numbers it's kind of
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
hard to work on the bill and knowing if
 
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's going to be effective if we don't
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
have numbers now
 
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
to compare with numbers passing
 
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.050 align:start position:0%
to compare with numbers passing
legislation

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
then how do we know if it even did what
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
they were looking for and that's that's
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
my concern with this on top of
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
increasing the hours which we like I
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
said is going to be a Snowball Effect
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
they came in now you got the police
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
academy who's going to be next in line
 
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
looking for their hours increased and it
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
bothers me to go down that road thank
 
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh and I agree
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
um that's why I'm actually going to move
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh that we retain this bill at the
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
present time I just think that there are
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
too many questions that we asked that we
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have answers to
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
um there are are available hours for the
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
retired firefighters to work at the
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
Academy but they're not taking those
 
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
hours they're splitting it with other
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
areas I want to know why that is is it a
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
rate of pay issue are they paying less
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
at the fire economy I think there are
 
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
other potential solutions that we can
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
look into be more than happy to work
 
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
with the fire academy towards some
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
solutions and by retaining this bill we
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
keep it in our working purview and we
 
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
can have those conversations hopefully
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
get some of those answers that we don't
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
have and make sure that the solution
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
that we're coming to is the right one uh
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
for the reasons the representative
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
Goldie mentioned we are opening a can of
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
worms if we just push forward with this
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
um to other areas other groups of people
 
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
and I'm really hesitant to do that
 
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.809 align:start position:0%
and I'm really hesitant to do that
personal

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:07.819 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to move that we retain HB
 
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.330 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to move that we retain HB
183

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:13.340 align:start position:0%
183
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
and I will just call a vote on that and
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
all right we'll move in that direction
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
at this point then and then we'll um see
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
what kind of information we can get with
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
that I'll close the subcommittee meeting
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
it was real quick one this morning and
 
00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:26.420 align:start position:0%

I'm here representing Rockingham
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
District 31 that's Auburn Candia
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
Chester and Deerfield uh I'm here to
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 519 with an FN it's
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing a chief
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
information security officer for the
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:40.819 align:start position:0%
um this this bill uh is
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
predominantly at the request of the
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
Chief Information
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
officer of of the state
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
um uh he and I have taught been talking
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
to each other now for almost six years
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
about I.T strategy and the like and so I
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
think we've developed a collegial
 
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.829 align:start position:0%
think we've developed a collegial
relationship

00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think anyone can argue that
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
in this era of cyber security
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities and penetrations that
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
having a really competent experience
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
trained individual in information
 
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
security there you are how are you
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh that that that is just vital to
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
protecting the privacy and security of
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
our data so the so that's that's the
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
obvious point the good news is that the
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners already hired this hired
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
this person to do this so what what are
 
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
we doing here what we're really doing is
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
we're putting the
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
um sort of the framework for what this
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
person's responsible for and accountable
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
for into the statute so that so that
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's just a stronger underpinning of
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
of what needs to be taking place and I
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
particularly like the governance and and
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh and risk uh program part of it that's
 
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
on the second page uh starting on line
 
00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.750 align:start position:0%
on the second page uh starting on line
10.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
10.
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I I think if I had looked at it and
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
thought about it a little bit more I
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
would have wanted to put privacy in
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
there too but but I I I trust that this
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
governance committee will be established
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
in the right way so so I I can take
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
questions but the the real person who
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
knows things is the commissioner
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards I have
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
a question if you don't have this
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
position in statute how did you hire
 
00:49:36.359 --> 00:49:38.210 align:start position:0%
position in statute how did you hire
somebody

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.010 align:start position:0%
somebody
yes

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah because the commissioner
 
00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:46.609 align:start position:0%
yeah because the commissioner
represented

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh good morning I'm Madam chair members
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is Dennis
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
Goulet I am the commissioner for the
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
um when I joined
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
um the state in 2015 May of 2015. we
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
already had a chief information security
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
officer that position had been
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
um it was a it was an unclassified
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
position that had been filled by my
 
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.569 align:start position:0%
position that had been filled by my
predecessor

00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
predecessor
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
um that we are now on our third Chief
 
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
Information secure security officer
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
since that position was established in
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
doit I believe that was what happened
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
there was a an unclassified former DHHS
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
position was brought to the the jcec and
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
was was established as the ciso what was
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
missing and what we're trying to repair
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
here is the you know the definition in
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
statute the authorities and
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in statute for that so
 
00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
so that we've had a pretty
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
high level robust cyber security
 
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.430 align:start position:0%
high level robust cyber security
function

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
um we're one of the leaders in the in
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
the nation in that respect
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
um but we were we have been missing the
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
codification of the actual
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility so that's what that's
 
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
what I would like to address with this
 
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.329 align:start position:0%
what I would like to address with this
legislation

00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes me feel better uh
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
Luckett said then Simon thank you yeah I
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
noticed that there was nothing explicit
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
about privacy in here and I was going to
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
ask you about that but you anticipated
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
it and uh if if you know you want to
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
talk to me we can do an amendment to
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
take care of that
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
um if I could I would like to address
 
00:51:25.619 --> 00:51:26.690 align:start position:0%
um if I could I would like to address
that

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.309 align:start position:0%
that
um so

00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
um where we're seeing States go in in
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
fact corporations uh all entities
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
security and privacy are too pretty
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
different things and so
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
I actually asked for a Chief privacy
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
officer function in the governor's
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
budget I don't know if whether that will
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
be funded or not in the governor's
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
budget but I've also told the governor
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
that I've talked to some folks including
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards about the need
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
for a privacy function in the state and
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
so if it's not funded in the governor's
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
budget I would be asking for it in
 
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
division one Finance as well when I'm
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh just real quick
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal impact so this is a
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
position that already exists will there
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
be any fiscal impact or not no they sent
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
me a fiscal note request and I sent back
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
a zero dollar FN and and so
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
um there's the the position itself
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
um I have a ciso who's as I said has
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
been around for over a decade and was uh
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
I think back in um 2016 I did bring the
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
position to the jcec again to get an
 
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
increase in Pay but we're still of
 
00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
course not close to Market in fact I
 
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:44.450 align:start position:0%
course not close to Market in fact I
think

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh I was recently interviewing for this
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
position and we were seeing the folks on
 
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
the on the private sector Market were
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
earning between three and four hundred
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
thousand a year which of course I'm not
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
paying uh anything close to that
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
is it just one position
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh there is a a chief information
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
security officer I also have a deputy
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges that states have
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
is it's a difficult position to retain
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
because it's such a hot commodity in the
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
market right now so I've been very
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
fortunate my last two cisos have been
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
ex-military so they've been retired and
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
taking a pension as well as getting paid
 
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
by the state there's a deputy and then
 
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.569 align:start position:0%
by the state there's a deputy and then
there's

00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
um three other people in that department
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
who are doing the day-to-day cyber
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
security operations I also have a
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
contract with a with an outside company
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
who does seven by twenty four 365
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring of all the end points in in
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh in the state as well
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
follow on yes follow-up
 
00:53:56.579 --> 00:53:58.970 align:start position:0%
follow on yes follow-up
follow-up

00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.290 align:start position:0%
follow-up
is

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
there a reason why we're not
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
project and why I'm asking this question
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
is that I am
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
fairly well versed
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
from an aerospace and defense industry
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint and when I log into my
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
legislative email there's no third party
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
authentication at all
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
it goes right literally goes right
 
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.690 align:start position:0%
it goes right literally goes right
through

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I would think that from a government
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
and state aspect that we are the most
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
vulnerable also that when you hire a
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
team of people
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
the changes in the cyber security
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
industry are coming so fast and furious
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
that having a subcontracted service in
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
my opinion is is much better and you're
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
not paying retirement and everything
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
else thank you okay there were there
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
were a couple parts to that I'll I'll
 
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
address the first one which was
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
um the you know my my domain is the
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
executive branch so so we do we do have
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
um multi-factor authentication
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
implemented for
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
um for most of the access in in the
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
executive branch and and email and
 
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
collaboration being one
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
um the we actually have a really tiny
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
staff that manages multiple contracts
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
one of them so I'd say we're heavily
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
outsourced not completely outsourced
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
even when you're fully outsourced you
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
still need a management function that
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
maintains the contracts and things like
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
that so so for example we have the 7 by
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
24 365 monitoring of all our systems
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
which is outsourced we have um Regular
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
cyber risk assessments which is
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
outsourced our third-party cyber risk
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
assessments that come in and assess
 
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
applications and practice and things
 
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
like that we have contracts for um
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
outside contracts for uh incident
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
response so should we have an incident
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
we need to bring in expertise whether it
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
be legal or technical or whatever so I
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'd say we're probably
 
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of cyber operations
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
perspective and cyber strategy we're
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
yeah and and if I may it just I want to
 
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
I want to add on to that and so I think
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
the commissioner just did a nice job of
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
of addressing your point there and to
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
your point yeah there's a lot of
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
Reliance on Outsourcing to to give us
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
everything we need
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
um I what the power of this bill is
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
primarily in my view is that uh to use
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
an army metaphor this is the mission
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
statement this this is what the
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislature uh and once it's signed by
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
the governor this is this this is the
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
legislative uh Charter to the
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner to ensure that these things
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
are getting done and and you know
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
without a clerk without Clarity in the
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
mission then there's some ambiguity on
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what our expectations are this
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
gives us an opportunity to clearly
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
communicate what our expectations are so
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
that then there's a dependence on on
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
their part to to get it done so so to me
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's a huge value in this bill is just
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
it we need to tell them what we what we
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
as far as the report's assessments and
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
other things are discussed in the bill
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
goes are these available to the public
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just worried about reports that get
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
filed but nobody ever sees them there's
 
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
no oversight
 
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you that's a good question
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
um we have the information Technology
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
Council which has
 
00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.069 align:start position:0%
Council which has
um

00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
representation for two house members are
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
represented and our cyber strategy
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
as well as if we have a you know reports
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
or things that we need to do we can go
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
into non-public session and the house
 
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
members and the other members of the I.T
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
Council are able to review and hold us
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
accountable for dealing with
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities I think if if you wanted
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
to dig into it you find you'd find that
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
we take our any vulnerabilities that we
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
do find very seriously additionally
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
we're almost continuously being audited
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
by the federal government multiple
 
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
entities inside the federal government
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
and in different ways too from a cyber
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
security and a privacy perspective so so
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
we're like SSA Social Security
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
Administration we just got done one of
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
those and we'll be going into one with
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
the health and human services from uh
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
Center for Medicaid Medicare Services
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
CMS and and we also have PCI audits
 
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
annually that's payment card industry
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
because we do a lot lot of payment card
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
business particularly the largest area
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
there would be the Liquor Commission so
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
we're almost continuously being audited
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
I actually have a compliance person who
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
manages the function inside doit of
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
being audited and responding to audit
 
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
findings if they come up
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
follow up so my job is to State the
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
obvious the blinding flash of the
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
obvious and and so to the point of
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
public reporting there there's a fine
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
line right where where yes there's
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
public transparency but you don't also
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to publish your
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities because that's the those
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
are the keys to the kingdom so so that
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
they they do have a way to keep that
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
information uh open to the right people
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
without making that public and I and I
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
do think there's an expectation that we
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to make it all public to
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
and if I could if I could add to that
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
and then I'll I'll take your your
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up there's also an exclusion in
 
00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.170 align:start position:0%
follow-up there's also an exclusion in
91a

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
91a
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay I I just
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
personally don't have much faith in the
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
federal government especially
 
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
considering the southern border I mean
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
is you know for them being oversight
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
capacity for the state seems kind of
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know I wouldn't credit that but the
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
point is
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
there's no way to have some kind of
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
redacted report given to the public it
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
just seems kind of odd to me you have a
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
we have a public position supposed to be
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
doing a public job the public is not
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on at least
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
there's there must be some way to
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
provide some information to the public
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
of what this person is doing
 
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying it has to be some
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
um today we haven't publicized
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
are the reports that are given by Third
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
parties we do we do publicly publish our
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
strategy and
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
um on our website and and any activities
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
we're taking and and we've been pretty
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh transparent too when we have found
 
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that required us to for
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
example some of you may remember we shut
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
down a whole bunch of Environmental
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
Services uh system some years ago when
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
we found a large number uh some fairly
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
significant vulnerabilities there and we
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'd publicly address that saying to to
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
the folks who have impacted folks
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
look we found a vulnerability we didn't
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
want to leave it open so I took the
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
systems down in collaboration with the
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Environmental Services
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
we are prioritizing the the remediation
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
of each one of those and items and
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
bringing them back live as soon as
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
possible and we did that out of even
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
though we you know I apologize for the
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
inconvenience to the public which of
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
course is important but also we want to
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
make sure we did protect their data so I
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
I feel like we are pretty transparent uh
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
up to a point where we as uh
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards says up to the
 
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
point where we don't um you know hand
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
Technology Council which is closely
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
involved with what the oit does and how
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
it performs and there are
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
representatives of the public namely a
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
couple of Representatives and two
 
01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:16.490 align:start position:0%
couple of Representatives and two
senators

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
senators
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
right right and and if I think if uh if
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
we if we wanted to make it clear that
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
there is a public-facing reporting
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
requirement a a way to consider doing
 
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
that is on line 10 of page two where it
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
lays out what this uh security
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
governance and risk program is about we
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
could make you know consider adding an
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
echo paragraph sub paragraph it just
 
01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:44.420 align:start position:0%
says something to the extent of uh
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring appropriate public reporting
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
because these meetings these governance
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
meetings will have both things that
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
could be public and things that should
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
not ever be public and but they could
 
01:02:59.089 --> 01:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
make that divide and and try to provide
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
the level of transparency that would
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
achieve that compromise I think does
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
that sound I we just made that up yeah
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
no I'd be happy to amend that another
 
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
possible Amendment too I've been wanting
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
to have more reps on the information
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
Technology Council a larger number we
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
have two and and I feel like I'd rather
 
01:03:21.289 --> 01:03:21.299 align:start position:0%
have four or estate reps on the
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
information Technology Council that way
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
I could know I'd always have two or
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
three attending each meeting because
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
schedules are hard to jockey so we could
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
consider if we end up amending language
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
on this to for reporting maybe we would
 
01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
want to amend to add two more reps to
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
the information Technology Council
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
Schmidt you had a question
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
no I have another one Madam chair so if
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to amend it is it a is it
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to go to a subcommittee
 
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.450 align:start position:0%
going to go to a subcommittee
huh

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
if it needs to be amended then yes it
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
will go to subcommittee which will go to
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative barotas okay well an
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
organization so we ought to
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to get on board with
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
all this amendment talk that we're
 
01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:08.780 align:start position:0%
appearing because uh
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of it is needs to be done
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative I'll defer to you well
 
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:20.150 align:start position:0%
representative I'll defer to you well
representative

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
by adding all this stuff
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
to a bill
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
that just is a simple bill
 
01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
making things complicated can't we just
 
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
pass the bill as it is and then you can
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
add it whatever you need to to your
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
Council in a separate I just don't want
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
this to become a bunch of stuff that
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
isn't related to the topic
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
so that my I'm just asking the question
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
um well I I am
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh either way rather whether
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
this gets amended or not I'm going to
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
add some kind of regular reporting
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
to to the duties of the ciso and and
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
using the I.T Council Information
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
Technology Council as a vehicle for said
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
reporting I think it's a it's a good
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's a good catch that
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Gerhard brought up and
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
I think that we you know to the extent
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
that we don't overdo how much
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
information we share I think reporting's
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
fine so I'm going to do that regardless
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
of what ends up in this bill all right
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
well if it doesn't need to be in statute
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
then I'm
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
um with representative Groton not
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily putting it into statute
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative AdWords so the question
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
is really kind of one of what's the
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislative strategy and and
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
now that I've introduced the bill the
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
bill belongs to the committee I'd
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
certainly defer to the chair and the
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee to what you want to do I just
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
want to let you know I I'm continuing
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to continue to help in
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
whatever way would facilitate getting
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
this bill passed I hope at its core you
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
see this is a good and necessary Bill
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
and you can support it and um and and I
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
think to your point representative you
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
know sometimes less is more we you know
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the good first start yeah
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative
 
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative
goalie

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and that was
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns is if we try in
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
increase the membership on the council
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
we would probably with that Amendment
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
need another public hearing because I'm
 
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
not sure that that would be Jermaine and
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
my I believe you're correct question
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
would be you know if
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
we have to let's bring in a separate
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation for that next year
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's needed at this time
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
just to get this going forward this is
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
an early bill I don't know exactly where
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's going but I believe it would be
 
01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
it's going but I believe it would be
Finance

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
and adding more people to the council is
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
certainly something that could be done
 
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
in this bill in finance or in the budget
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
chair I didn't get my second question in
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh um so you mentioned the jcec
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
situation earlier commissioner
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
as a one of the members of the jcec as a
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
matter of fact the only one that's
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
appointed at the moment uh you do have a
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
questionnaire in the system at the
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
moment because I think we ought to
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
proceed with that if we possibly can
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
once we get the jcec set up
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
um well I do have a couple things I'm
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
going to bring before the jcec but not
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
not this position this position is
 
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.710 align:start position:0%
not this position this position is
already

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
um where it needs to be with respect to
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
that okay thanks good to know
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%

all right seeing none I will close the
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:07:57.539 --> 01:07:59.450 align:start position:0%
public hearing

if we have time to accept okay without
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
objection we'll go into executive
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
session is there a motion
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative I move ought to pass on
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
second uh this bill
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion ought to pass by
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
Reverend Lucas do you wish to speak to
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
your motion I do
 
01:08:20.759 --> 01:08:21.530 align:start position:0%
your motion I do
um

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
you know having this
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
I mean you need
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
to have a an overall organized plan and
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
someone monitoring it and updating it to
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
even know if you're okay in the in
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
regards to security so I think having
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
this uh position and the definition of
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
Duties is is important
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt do you
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second no I think
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that we ought to proceed as quickly
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
as possible to get that we we've heard
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
repeatedly over the years that the state
 
01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:55.309 align:start position:0%
repeatedly over the years that the state
is

01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
being attacked literally thousands of
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
times every day by outside sources and
 
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.030 align:start position:0%
times every day by outside sources and
we

01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
can't leave any stone unturned thank you
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone else wish to speak
 
01:09:10.570 --> 01:09:10.580 align:start position:0%
questions representing Gerhard
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm a little bit
 
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
confused as to the rush since this
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
position already exists and it's
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
operating at this time the position is
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
not the rush is not for the position but
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
for the bill it we this is an early Bill
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
we need to vote it out of committee no
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
later than next week
 
01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
later than next week
so

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
I'll add that we have a lot of bills
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
takes up exact next week so if we can
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
get anything done today is a good idea
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else thank you

01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
it does not have a large dollar amount
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's small enough to be consider it
 
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.229 align:start position:0%
it's small enough to be consider it
negligible

01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%

and the gel car committee
um

01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
as representative Schmidt knows and many
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
but many of you have not had the
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discover
 
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules process forbids
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
a department from incorporating by
 
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:07.970 align:start position:0%
a department from incorporating by
reference

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
a document that they produce
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
because if they are producing it and
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
they want it to be in rules and apply
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
then it should go through rulemaking
 
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
however in this case
 
01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.490 align:start position:0%
however in this case
the

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:24.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
Equalization manual is developed by the
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board which had been
 
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
an independent entity and it is now
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of Revenue
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
they want to continue using that manual
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
because all the assessors are familiar
 
01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:48.140 align:start position:0%
with it it's in assessing language and
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
they don't want to
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
put it into legalese for the benefit of
 
01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.410 align:start position:0%
put it into legalese for the benefit of
rules

01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
but because that would be to the first
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of work and secondly would
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
be to make it less useful
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
for the uh
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
for the people who actually have to use
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
it namely the assessors
 
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.490 align:start position:0%
it namely the assessors
so

01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
the fact that it wasn't
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
not that they wanted to incorporate by
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
reference was strongly supported by gel
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
car but we need we need to give them
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
explicit exemption from the the normal
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
rules to
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
allow it so House Bill 285 does that it
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
says that even though the assessing
 
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
Standards Board is now attached to
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
revenue assessment they can still
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
use refer to the assessing standards
 
01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:43.370 align:start position:0%
use refer to the assessing standards
manual

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
manual
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
and attach it by reference
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
it keeps things the way they are
 
01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.850 align:start position:0%
it keeps things the way they are
and

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
despite the reorganization of where the
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
board reports to and it is simpler and
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
easier for everybody involved so I hope
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
you will support it
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Lucas
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you what is the process for
 
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
updating the equalization manual who all
 
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
would have to approve any changes to
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
um and the assessing standards boards is
 
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
made up of who uh
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's a number of assessors the treasurer
 
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
I believe and representative Schmidt
 
01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
will be able to answer that because he's
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
been on the assessing Standards Board
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
for a while okay follow-up yes the
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
reason I ask is that um
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
and I assume the the reason that um
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
rules should not reference outside
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
things is because
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
then it's not being approved by gelcoir
 
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
or the legislation legislature whatever
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I have the same concern potentially
 
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
for over this the assessing Standards
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
Board although it is administratively
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of Revenue
 
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
assessment is not controlled by it and
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
the dra does not have very many members
 
01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
on the board
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
all right it's a fairly independent
 
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.350 align:start position:0%
all right it's a fairly independent
group

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay I'll wait until the more detailed
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
answer on who's on it
 
01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:18.649 align:start position:0%
answer on who's on it
representative

01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
yes I do have a question I just want a
 
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
confirmation so this basically
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
says that the current practices that are
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
being used by the assessing board and
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
the assessing manual will not change
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
just because the response where they
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
live is has changed
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
yes and so what were the ramifications
 
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.270 align:start position:0%
yes and so what were the ramifications
be

01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
if we did not have this legislation
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
then the assessing Standards Board would
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
in the dra would have to put their
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
Equalization manual
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
as a rule adopted as a rule including
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
the formatting requirements
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
and representative do you have an
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
amendment with you for this I have an
 
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
amendment yes which is also at the
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
request of the dra and it simply
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
clarifies they already have it yes I
 
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
passed it around already this is
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment zero zero eight six h
 
01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh okay and it simply adds to their
 
01:21:38.699 --> 01:21:41.149 align:start position:0%
uh okay and it simply adds to their
duties

01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
duties
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
that they can develop the forms they
 
01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.770 align:start position:0%
that they can develop the forms they
need

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
and that those forms or returns may be
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
required to be signed under the pain and
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
penalties of perjury
 
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes point of order the
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
amendment isn't scheduled until 10 45
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I just recognized that I apologize
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
for that yeah I just don't want to get
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
ahead of ourselves yeah right fine so if
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
if I believe representative Schmidt
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on the basic bill and I
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh yes representatives to it yes
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire was this bill
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
the original Bill requested by dra yes
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and agreed to buy gel car as
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
you can tell by the list of sponsors
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
because this is another instance where
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
it does not state that in the analysis
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
the chair will call Representative
 
01:22:40.679 --> 01:22:49.250 align:start position:0%
the chair will call Representative
Schmidt

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
Peter Schmidt representing Dover award
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
One Stratford 14. so uh
 
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
just as a little bit of background uh
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
the there used to be an equalization
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
Standards Board as well as an assessing
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
Standards Board
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
um I was on that for a while too until
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
it was done away with uh and now it's
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
kind of a subcommittee of the of the
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
um but there there are a couple of
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
aspects involved here uh there's the the
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
gel car has a style and a manual that
 
01:23:30.169 --> 01:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
requires specific language rules can't
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
be written just kind of willy-nilly all
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
over the place it there's a standard
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
manual for how rules have to be uh have
 
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
to be phrased and codified
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
and but in addition to this particular
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
thing for example the insurance industry
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
has a whole uh jargon if you will
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and they also incorporate some of
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
their Rules by reference so that so that
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
you don't wind up with something where
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh the the language that would all have
 
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
to be Rewritten to fit into the style
 
01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:13.580 align:start position:0%
Manual of the gel car
 
01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
and uh that that would be a lot of work
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
for one thing but it also uh would not
 
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
be all that understandable for the
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
industry which is used to kind of a
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
national jargon so anyway so
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
incorporating by reference really is
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
pretty vital to to have a continuity in
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
the particular specialized field of
 
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
dra in this case or Insurance in another
 
01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.530 align:start position:0%
dra in this case or Insurance in another
case

01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:24:48.729 --> 01:24:48.739 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh the the uh this the gel car
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
occasionally has situations where
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
particular Industries come before us
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
they want to incorporate something very
 
01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:57.530 align:start position:0%
they want to incorporate something very
reference

01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and it has to be vetted by the four
 
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
attorneys that we have uh in the
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit who do the
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
background vetting of all these
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
um of all these rules so anyway it's
 
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:15.380 align:start position:0%
it's this is appropriate and as as
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
representation would ask in her question
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
it is requested by the dra
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
which still oversees some aspects of the
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board the rest of it
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
has been transferred previously just
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
relatively recently to under the oplc
 
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
and we'll get into that unless there's a
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative likes thank you I
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not necessarily opposed to this
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
but I'd I'd like to be comfortable
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
understanding uh one thing and that is
 
01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
um I think having rules go by gel car
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
and having the legislature involved in
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay and them is important
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know how changes the
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
equalization manual were handled before
 
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
and and who had to approve them
 
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
and how that might change as part of
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
this but I'm just trying to be assured
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
that in uh if this goes through that
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's still going to be the legislature
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
that has to approve any changes to this
 
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
Equalization manual if it's going to be
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
incorporated by reference into rules
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that there's that it
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
currently is the the requirement that
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature approved rules uh that's
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
what the gel car is for and that's why
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
we have professional attorneys to vet
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
the rules yeah I'm the gel car
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
representing the rest of the legislature
 
01:26:39.239 --> 01:26:40.030 align:start position:0%
representing the rest of the legislature
okay

01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
on that premise yeah
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
yeah we we absolutely that's what the
 
01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
gel car is all about it is a gatekeeper
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
that says we are giving the the
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
executive branch this is important for
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
everybody to understand uh the rules
 
01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:57.980 align:start position:0%
have the force and effective laws okay
 
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
and and in in allowing the executive
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
branch to write rules
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh which have the force and effect of
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
law we are as the edge as the
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislature giving up a portion of our
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
our our prerogative power to the
 
01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
but obviously if there were no
 
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper involved the the executive
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
branch could
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
I could run all the wild but they could
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
they could they could get overboard and
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
so the gel car
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's all the rules that the the
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
executive branch produces because it is
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
that the various different agencies that
 
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:43.139 align:start position:0%
write the rules okay then they get
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
vetted by the four attorneys that we
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
currently have in the administrative
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
rules ruin it and but they can they only
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
have oversight up to a certain level if
 
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of a disagreement
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
if if I could interrupt I mean this is
 
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
not at all getting to my question until
 
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
if I could have a follow-up you can have
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you I understand all
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
that my my concern is uh understanding
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
how changes to the equalization manual
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
are approved and my concern is I want to
 
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
make sure that not the whole legislature
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
but you know something Joe car or
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
something similar is involved in
 
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
approving those changes if they're going
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
to be incorporated by reference as rules
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
well it would still have to go through
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
that that betting as I understand it uh
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
the the question is not whether it gets
 
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
seen the question of whether it has to
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
adhere to all the other gel car
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
requirements one of which is this
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
language situation it's not the content
 
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
so much as the way it's couched because
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of terms of Art in for
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
example if I could get follow-up yes
 
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
what is the process and who's involved
 
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
in approving changes to the equalization
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
manual is that gel car or somebody else
 
01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:06.860 align:start position:0%
no the the the the the equalization
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the ASB still operates
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
and and and in the realm of Equalization
 
01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:16.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not on the equalization subcommit
 
01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
anymore but it but it but it it still
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
gets seen But when the rules get
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
Incorporated they get Incorporated by
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
reference rather than having to adhere
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
to all the aspects of the gel car manual
 
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up I think yes I think I
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
might be getting to what I'm looking for
 
01:29:32.699 --> 01:29:33.950 align:start position:0%
might be getting to what I'm looking for
so

01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
during their
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's included in Rules by reference so
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to follow the format but
 
01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:44.060 align:start position:0%
if there are changes in the
 
01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
equalization manual does gel car itself
 
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
have to approve those changes
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
I think the answer is yes it was in
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
accurate to say that the gel car can
 
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
object to changes well we do ask for
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
when there is a major change to a
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
document by reference Joker asks for ex
 
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
and the agencies required to provide an
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
explanation of what changed why and why
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so I you know I'm maybe
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
saying approved by is uh
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
inaccurate but at least if they're going
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
to be changed the manual with gel cars
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
still review it as they would review any
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
Rule and have the same rights to object
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
and you know even even put in a
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
resolution move back and all that okay
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not an open door for them
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
to do anything they want that's for sure
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Payback
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my question is what
 
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my question is what
caused

01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
caused
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
this bill to be drafted what was the
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
scenario that was the alarm to
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
the reason is that the assessing
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
Standards Board
 
01:31:19.129 --> 01:31:19.139 align:start position:0%
we had a reorganization and the
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board is now an
 
01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.209 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board is now an
independent

01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
entity administratively attached to the
 
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.169 align:start position:0%
entity administratively attached to the
dra

01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
dra
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's a change in where it's
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
um where was it before well it
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
everything was under uh the dra before
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
but there was a particular problem and
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
that is that that assessors are overseen
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
by the dra but that is the dra is kind
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
I don't want to call it a puzzle Palace
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
but but it it has a lot of
 
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
confidentiality requirements where
 
01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:03.260 align:start position:0%
things just you can't get at it because
 
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:06.260 align:start position:0%
of the nature of the revenue
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
Administration okay and one of the
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
things that was that was kept
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
confidential was evaluations of
 
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
assessors so if there are complaints and
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
that went into this black box thank you
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh and that was never the legislature's
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
intent but that but in putting the the
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
assessing standard board under the uh
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
the dra that came with it that
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
confidentiality but we said that's not
 
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
what we want so we took most of the the
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
operations of the assessing Standards
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
Board out of the dra and put them under
 
01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:45.729 align:start position:0%
Board out of the dra and put them under
oplc

01:32:45.729 --> 01:32:45.739 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
so that so that the Assessors for
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
example would be and their operations
 
01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
would be transparent to the public which
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
was always the intent of the legislature
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
and the confidentiality was something
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
that came with dra but was not something
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
that we wanted that's why we changed it
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
but in terms of one and I can't remember
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is that the dra still
 
01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.129 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is that the dra still
oversees

01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank thank you representative I
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I'm going to close
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB 285 and open
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
6h and I think it might actually speak
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
this amendment is
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
was also a request to the dra which uh
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
they they asked me to put in while I was
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
talking about the uh
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
when I when I talked to them about the
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
bill itself they said oh well will you
 
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
take care of
um

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
this minor detail
 
01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
and this is something that came out of
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
jail car
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
some of the dra forms
 
01:34:25.129 --> 01:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
and returned ours are signed under the
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
looking at tax returns that seems
 
01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable
 
01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:36.830 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable
and

01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
that the rules of gel car require that
 
01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:43.820 align:start position:0%
such a form be
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
needed to have specific approval
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
to or
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the uh the pains and penalties of
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
perjury apply to this to the particular
 
01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.290 align:start position:0%
perjury apply to this to the particular
form

01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh the dra is
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
thought it would be easier if they just
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
had a blanket exemption because nearly
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
all of their forms are signed under the
 
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
so they they asked for a blanket
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
exemption you'll notice this is in RSA
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
21j which is what defines the Department
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
they can ask they can if you sign a tax
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
return or something like that they can
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
assess they can go after you for perjury
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
or unsworn falsification or whatever
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
actually perjury perjury in this case
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
even if the form doesn't specifically
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
say so
 
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
and they think of this as a simple
 
01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.370 align:start position:0%
and they think of this as a simple
cleanup

01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
cleanup
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I will try to answer it I'm
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my contact at dra has
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
another bill he's presenting at the
 
01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
moment but the department did send out a
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
letter which I believe they sent to the
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
entire committee
 
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
in support of this amendment
 
01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
in support of this amendment
questions

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
um just are the currently now and I
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
assume this wouldn't change it are those
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh forms or returns
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
no that's one of the exemptions that uh
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the dra has they can change their
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
forms at any time
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly yes and so that's current
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
separate from this bill current and
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
separate absolutely thank you
 
01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you so much thank you
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
did anybody else wish to speak on HB 285
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so uh in response to the question it
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
was just asked I wanted to say that
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
um the the dra is a taxing entity is
 
01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:05.060 align:start position:0%
subject in many of its
 
01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
aspects to Federal uh preemption and so
 
01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.290 align:start position:0%
aspects to Federal uh preemption and so
forth

01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:11.300 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
and it kind of acts as a pass-through
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
agencies to some degree for the for uh
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
IRS and because
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
forms that are issued by the IRS
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
have to be implemented
 
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:30.659 align:start position:0%
very quickly you know they have
 
01:37:33.970 --> 01:37:33.980 align:start position:0%
deadlines and so forth uh and the the
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
rules process uh the vetting process is
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat time consuming and so they they
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
dra rules have to be very flexible to
 
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
into to
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
Encompass if you will or that's not a
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
good word uh the right way is not the
 
01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:58.139 align:start position:0%
right word anyway it's a perfectly good
 
01:37:58.139 --> 01:37:59.209 align:start position:0%
right word anyway it's a perfectly good
word

01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
um but anyway they have to be flexible
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
in order to meet IRS deadline
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
requirements and so their rules uh in in
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
some regards are are exempt from the gel
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
guy process I was on a subcommittee
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago that looked at that
 
01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
particular aspect it was viewed to
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
changing it and they the tra came in and
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
said you're asking us to effectively
 
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
violate federal law and requirements so
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
we we have lots of things on gel car
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
where we're passing Federal requirements
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
through because it's
 
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
national law
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
so it's important to understand that
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anybody else
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
want to speak to the amendment
 
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:56.570 align:start position:0%
want to speak to the amendment
2023-80086

01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
well without objection I'll go into
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll move lot to pass with Amendment
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 285.
 
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
yes no no no you have to have a motion
 
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.790 align:start position:0%
yes no no no you have to have a motion
first

01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
off did you want to second that
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to speak to the motion as I
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
as I said this is a request to the dra
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
it will simplify their processes
 
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:53.699 align:start position:0%
and give them Authority it doesn't cost
 
01:39:53.699 --> 01:39:55.669 align:start position:0%
and give them Authority it doesn't cost
anything

01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:39:55.679 --> 01:39:56.990 align:start position:0%
anything
um

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
it simply cleans up some of the statutes
 
01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
and at their request
 
01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
um I have nothing to add thank you okay
 
01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to talk about
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I'll vote for the amendment I'm just
 
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh you know I understand the issue about
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
timeliness and and the FEDS but I am
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
concerned that uh
 
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
we're having forms created without
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight that people can be
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know can require information without
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
perjury threat so I'll look into that
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
yes I I agree it's something we should
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
it it definitely is a good idea that we
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
not just kind of like don't even look at
 
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.570 --> 01:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
oh that's something so it's what's
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:06.169 --> 01:41:06.179 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation is determined
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
by the agency and the organization the
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
gel car which is a legislative body so
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
if they agree to these types of and
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
these are experienced people
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
experienced Representatives so who have
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
been on these committees for a long time
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't have any concern with these
 
01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
types of requests if this was something
 
01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
put together
 
01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:32.629 align:start position:0%
put together
um

01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
in in a expedient way I would have more
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
concerns but I think that the bill in
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
itself defines what we're doing and how
 
01:41:44.810 --> 01:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative just just wondering if
 
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
the previous comment was related to the
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
amendment of the bill and the reason I
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
ask is that
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know my concern was around the
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
forms not being reviewed by childcare at
 
01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:00.530 align:start position:0%
forms not being reviewed by childcare at
all

01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
it was everything mm-hmm okay anyone
 
01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.689 align:start position:0%
it was everything mm-hmm okay anyone
else

01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the motion is to adopt
 
01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:11.900 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
sorry a flag kind of hidden down here
 
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to state that
 
01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
currently I think probably the
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
foremost Representatives uh with
 
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
authority and knowledge of the processes
 
01:42:30.490 --> 01:42:30.500 align:start position:0%
of gel car
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
our Representatives Maguire and Schmidt
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
so I will just say that if they're okay
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
just just in response to that I I agree
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
um so I'm taking advantage of their
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge to try and understand what's
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
going on here
 
01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.250 align:start position:0%
going on here
okay

01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:58.370 --> 01:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and it never hurts to get an
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
extra eye or three on
 
01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:03.500 align:start position:0%
on any agency
 
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:06.780 align:start position:0%

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
board meeting in order to address the
 
02:03:54.659 --> 02:03:57.669 align:start position:0%
board meeting in order to address the
rule

02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.129 --> 02:04:01.139 align:start position:0%
and I will try to answer questions and
 
02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:03.179 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
other people here who know more about it
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay my question uh is on the sentence
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom of page one going
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
into page two the chair of the standing
 
02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
receiving proposed rules shall review
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules in consultation with
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
members of the standing policy committee
 
02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
my question is what does in consultation
 
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
with the members of the policy committee
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
mean is that a committee meeting a vote
 
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
it depends
 
02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
if for example we were to receive such a
 
02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
document now
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
we would have a committee meeting on it
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
in somewhat like an executive session
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
and make a committee recommendation if
 
02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
it were to be issued on Halloween
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
it would probably come to me and I would
 
02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
I might talk to some people that I think
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
are likely to be real re-elected
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
but it would be a much less formal
 
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.430 align:start position:0%
but it would be a much less formal
process

02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
and the and the difference in access to
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
the legislature between the when we're
 
02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
actually in session when we're not is
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yeah I'm a little
 
02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to vagueness
 
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't know just how it
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
would be worded to make it clearer but
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
to at least if possible have it uh have
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
there be a requirement that
 
02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
there'd be a meeting and a vote
 
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
um and then the other part of that is
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
what's the time frame on this between
 
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.070 align:start position:0%
what's the time frame on this between
um

02:05:37.070 --> 02:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
the proposed rule change and when the
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee would have to I think there
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
was a date
 
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:47.589 align:start position:0%
was a date
um

02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's on line 13 the end of the public
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
comment period
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
and they do in fact read and respond to
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
public comments they don't always adopt
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative Cody yeah
 
02:06:16.199 --> 02:06:19.129 align:start position:0%
representative Cody yeah
so

02:06:19.129 --> 02:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.649 --> 02:06:21.659 align:start position:0%
I support the bill
 
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
my own so and I think it would be
 
02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
helpful for the committee
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
if they knew
 
02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:32.219 align:start position:0%
how many rules
 
02:06:35.089 --> 02:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
are generated as a result of legislation
 
02:06:35.099 --> 02:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
are generated as a result of legislation
that

02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know myself but there's expected
 
02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
to be several hundred this year
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
and part of it of course is that it was
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
10 years ago that we extended the life
 
02:06:51.530 --> 02:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
of a rule to 10 years
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
and so they're all coming due at once
 
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.290 align:start position:0%
and so they're all coming due at once
um

02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.089 --> 02:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
you can ask the staff they know better
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
than I do the exact count
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up I just although I
 
02:07:04.679 --> 02:07:06.290 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up I just although I
recognize

02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.250 align:start position:0%
recognize
um

02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you can speak to the practicality
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
of having the committee review all the
 
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:18.770 align:start position:0%
of having the committee review all the
rules

02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
well right well this is only new rules
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
right so that for example if they're
 
02:07:27.129 --> 02:07:27.139 align:start position:0%
it would be because of new legislation
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
and presumably
 
02:07:31.129 --> 02:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:07:33.649 --> 02:07:33.659 align:start position:0%
would still remember what they what they
 
02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
had in mind
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
but if you're looking at an existing
 
02:07:41.209 --> 02:07:41.219 align:start position:0%
rule that's being tweaked
 
02:07:44.209 --> 02:07:44.219 align:start position:0%
as it's being renewed it's rather
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
unlikely there'll be very many people on
 
02:07:48.169 --> 02:07:48.179 align:start position:0%
the committee that would remember what
 
02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
they passed 10 12 years ago thank you
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas just to clarify
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
in that case this bill wouldn't require
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
the committee to look at it because it's
 
02:08:02.689 --> 02:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
not a new rule correct all right thank
 
02:08:02.699 --> 02:08:04.550 align:start position:0%
not a new rule correct all right thank
you

02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:08:07.070 --> 02:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative goalie
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
if the committee sends back their
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the rule does not
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
meet the intent of the statute what
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
can happen
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
well since it since the rule
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
is in the public comment phase
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
my expectation would be that the rule
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
would be substantially revised to comply
 
02:08:41.330 --> 02:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
and if not
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that if any committee
 
02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
replied that the rule doesn't meet
 
02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
legislative intent they would be keeping
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.450 --> 02:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:02.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:04.430 align:start position:0%
um
I

02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:09:07.629 --> 02:09:07.639 align:start position:0%
conscious of objections that we
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
constantly heard at jalcar that the
 
02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:13.580 align:start position:0%
process takes a long time
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh and appreciative of the fact that in
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
fact it does take a long time because
 
02:09:21.250 --> 02:09:21.260 align:start position:0%
it's an important process
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
however I do see this
 
02:09:28.609 --> 02:09:28.619 align:start position:0%
process as possibly even lengthening the
 
02:09:31.129 --> 02:09:31.139 align:start position:0%
period of time that it takes to get
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
rules adopted
 
02:09:36.169 --> 02:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the sending the
 
02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
specifically yeah I it might but
 
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
more I would more expect that if there
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
are issues since the committee has to
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
respond in the same time as the public
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
agency would be getting those comments
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
back at the time they're expecting to be
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
revising the rule anyway it may take
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
them a little longer or they have to do
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
a total rewrite if they were in
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
opposition to the legislative intent
 
02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
but this is a period when they're
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the rule and revising
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
it because of the public comment uh it
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't add that much it's not a
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
separate cycle it's a parallel input to
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
follow it follow up
 
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
um am I understanding
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
the language correctly that uh the
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
policy committee that these would be
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
submitted to would be determined by the
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
speaker and the Senate President is that
 
02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
um let's see who art says
 
02:10:54.669 --> 02:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
as defined in RSA 541a
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
Roman 16 which
 
02:10:58.679 --> 02:10:59.930 align:start position:0%
Roman 16 which
I

02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:11:03.649 --> 02:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
but I'll take a look at who determines
 
02:11:21.550 --> 02:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.209 --> 02:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay standing policy committee means a
 
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
committee listed in the rules of the
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate to which legislation
 
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
including rulemaking Authority was
 
02:11:38.089 --> 02:11:38.099 align:start position:0%
originally referred for hearing and
 
02:11:38.099 --> 02:11:39.410 align:start position:0%
originally referred for hearing and
Report

02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
Report
 
02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:40.910 align:start position:0%
Report
so

02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
it would be the committee that actually
 
02:11:44.689 --> 02:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
passed the
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
recommended the bill that
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:53.689 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:56.410 --> 02:11:56.420 align:start position:0%
um yes go ahead
 
02:11:58.729 --> 02:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
now my brain has forgotten the other
 
02:11:58.739 --> 02:12:04.490 align:start position:0%
now my brain has forgotten the other
question

02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
oh thank you um
 
02:12:09.530 --> 02:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you
 
02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:10.189 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you
um

02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
was consideration given
 
02:12:19.010 --> 02:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh to possibly stating that the minority
 
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
a minority member of the committee
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:27.589 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the exact language but
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
the minority is a member of the
 
02:12:34.609 --> 02:12:34.619 align:start position:0%
committee and would be consulted along
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah just one kind of I think
 
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
following on what representative was
 
02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
just saying because it is a little bit
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
open-ended and we don't know exactly who
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
will be involved at any given time
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
whether we're in session or out of
 
02:12:59.159 --> 02:13:00.069 align:start position:0%
whether we're in session or out of
session

02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
who determines who can give feedback
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
to the any member of the public can that
 
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
is interested can give feedback to the
 
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
agency on a rule so we're not we're not
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
looking for any particular hierarchy
 
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
within the committee to run it through
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
they can just go directly to the
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
as written it just says that the chair
 
02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.099 align:start position:0%
is responsible for making sure that any
 
02:13:29.089 --> 02:13:29.099 align:start position:0%
comments get to the agency
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
and if any member of the committee
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
gets newly appointed or whatever they
 
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
can easily respond as a member of the
 
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
public which is legitimate
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
um and I will say that the
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
that random Representatives comments on
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
rules are given quite a bit of respect I
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
put some comments in on the driver's
 
02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
license's licensing rules last year and
 
02:14:02.089 --> 02:14:02.099 align:start position:0%
they completely rewrote the section that
 
02:14:04.729 --> 02:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
I was concerned about not quite what I
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
wanted but a lot better than it was
 
02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:09.709 align:start position:0%
wanted but a lot better than it was
um so

02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:14:13.609 --> 02:14:13.619 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I think we're
 
02:14:15.050 --> 02:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
all set there
 
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
um the chair will call Representative
 
02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:27.169 align:start position:0%
um the chair will call Representative
Schmidt

02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:29.089 --> 02:14:29.099 align:start position:0%
before you begin representative Schmidt
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
if anybody else is planning on
 
02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:32.099 align:start position:0%
testifying if they wouldn't mind filling
 
02:14:39.649 --> 02:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
I I've served on the gel car for 16
 
02:14:48.719 --> 02:14:50.689 align:start position:0%
I I've served on the gel car for 16
years

02:14:50.689 --> 02:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
um during that time I think I've missed
 
02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
one meeting so I'm not an occasional
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
visitor to the committee process
 
02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
I've been there I've also been the vice
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I I think the this bill is well
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
intentioned but you have already and
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
with some of your questions even though
 
02:15:18.169 --> 02:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
most of you ex as a matter of fact
 
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
except for representative schwart I
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
think none of you have been on the gel
 
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
car uh other than me I'm sitting over
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
here but even uh without having served
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
you've already kind of sensed and and
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
and started to address some of the feet
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
of clay of this bill
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
well intentioned or not in my opinion uh
 
02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
um kind of a Rube Goldberg machine you
 
02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
all know what a Rube Goldman machine is
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
well I look it up on your on your cell
 
02:15:58.129 --> 02:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
phones or your apps as we're talking and
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see it's a device that goes
 
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
around you know it's kind of like going
 
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
from here to Boston by way of Los
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
Angeles uh you can get there but you
 
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do it under almost any
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances so
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
um this this concept even though it's
 
02:16:17.770 --> 02:16:17.780 align:start position:0%
been worked on by the
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit up on staffers
 
02:16:24.530 --> 02:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
in in the interim
 
02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and it it it is of questionable
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
workability at Best in my opinion and I
 
02:16:35.810 --> 02:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
think it's also to some degree
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
um a solution in search of a problem the
 
02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
gel car is not perfect and I'm not
 
02:16:42.849 --> 02:16:42.859 align:start position:0%
saying it is
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
but it's been in place for what 30
 
02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:51.380 align:start position:0%
30 years Mike
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
1983 17 and 22 makes 39 I believe okay
 
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
so almost 40 years and
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think it works pretty well it
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
has lots of uh of skilled attorneys over
 
02:17:10.490 --> 02:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
the years and I've worked with uh this
 
02:17:13.129 --> 02:17:13.139 align:start position:0%
group but also the people who proceed to
 
02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
them and some of the people who preceded
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
them in my 16 years on the committee uh
 
02:17:20.929 --> 02:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
and and and there are four of them to
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
vet the rules
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
um and uh currently and uh and I think
 
02:17:28.559 --> 02:17:31.969 align:start position:0%
um and uh currently and uh and I think
that

02:17:31.969 --> 02:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
um it it is one of the specific aspects
 
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
I want to address is the idea when you
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
have a a situation when the legislature
 
02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
is out of session
 
02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
in other words the Committees are not
 
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
really available or it's not supposed to
 
02:17:48.410 --> 02:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
be any legislative work in July and
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
August for the new those are new uh
 
02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
speakers generally have been saying no
 
02:17:56.209 --> 02:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
legislative work in July and August and
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
the committee doesn't usually start
 
02:18:01.849 --> 02:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
meeting until maybe October uh to look
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
at retained bills and so forth and so on
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
so for more about six months of the year
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
the Committees are not there which means
 
02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
now you're going to have to confer with
 
02:18:15.310 --> 02:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
the chairman if he or she is available
 
02:18:17.929 --> 02:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
and then that person is going to try to
 
02:18:21.049 --> 02:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
confer with medicine member members of
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
the committee if they're available what
 
02:18:25.009 --> 02:18:25.019 align:start position:0%
about if you've got a divided committee
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
I think somebody asked a question in
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
this regard earlier what if you got a
 
02:18:31.849 --> 02:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
divided committee then the question
 
02:18:35.929 --> 02:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
becomes well what is the intent of the
 
02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
rule that's one of the chief pillars of
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
gel car we uh a rule cannot exceed
 
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority that's one of them
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
and the other main pillar of the gel car
 
02:18:51.889 --> 02:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
process is it's not it cannot be
 
02:18:54.770 --> 02:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
contrary to legislative intent
 
02:18:58.009 --> 02:18:58.019 align:start position:0%
and that's what these people do
 
02:19:01.009 --> 02:19:01.019 align:start position:0%
they look at the statute or they look at
 
02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
the existing rule if it has to be
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
re-adopted and they try to Divine I use
 
02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
the word intentionally uh because it's
 
02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
kind of God like to determine what
 
02:19:13.730 --> 02:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is above and beyond
 
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
what the words are because of course
 
02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.139 align:start position:0%
there's also a legislative record that's
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to tell you how the committee
 
02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:23.099 align:start position:0%
got to the
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
the rule they've recommended right
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
that's what it works on we look at the
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
rule we talk about it we mull about it
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have a subcommittee on it we we uh we
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
try to come to a Unity between the the
 
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
one party and the other to some degree
 
02:19:41.389 --> 02:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
but also in terms of
 
02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
um what the best way is in many cases to
 
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
try to determine how many angels are on
 
02:19:50.210 --> 02:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
the head of that pin or you know exactly
 
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
which way you're going and it's a lot of
 
02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
hair splitting going on sometimes as
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been here for a
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
while can attest so uh now going back
 
02:20:01.849 --> 02:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
and trying to determine exactly what
 
02:20:03.889 --> 02:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is above and beyond
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
what the plain language of the statute
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
is sometimes it's very clear that's what
 
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
courts are all about
 
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and that's why it's what they come up
 
02:20:15.730 --> 02:20:15.740 align:start position:0%
with is called an opinion for one thing
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh and so this is I I think it as I said
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's kind of solution in search of a
 
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
problem uh and it's a very very much of
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
a Rube Goldberg device look it up if you
 
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
haven't already and you'll get my sense
 
02:20:35.210 --> 02:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's not that it couldn't possibly work
 
02:20:36.650 --> 02:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
are the are the
 
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
the possible frailties of gel car are
 
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
they such that we have to create this
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:20:49.389 --> 02:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
little Goldberg device this rigmarole
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
this you know seven ways around the
 
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
corner to try to get a better result
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
than we're currently getting without any
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
changes at all
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it with that and you can
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
ask any questions if you got
 
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative for sitting in the hot
 
02:21:10.319 --> 02:21:11.630 align:start position:0%
representative for sitting in the hot
seat

02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
seat
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here you don't have to
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank me
 
02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:16.670 align:start position:0%
thank me
so

02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:19.550 align:start position:0%
you don't
believe

02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
the committee that passed the
 
02:21:23.450 --> 02:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
legislation should at least be apprised
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the rule that goes along with that
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation should be vetted by
 
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
that committee that passed passed it
 
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
they vet the statute that's their job
 
02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
they vet the statute the jail card then
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
sorry the administer first of all it
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
goes to the agency right for rule
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
writing and the agencies are where the
 
02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
practical knowledge on the part of the
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
state is right and there's kind of a
 
02:21:55.250 --> 02:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
back and forth to some degree between
 
02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules unit attorneys
 
02:22:00.429 --> 02:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
and the rule Riders
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
to to work something out then you have a
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing where the public has
 
02:22:07.969 --> 02:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
another chance to weigh in on the rule
 
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's workable or unfair or goes
 
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
off the rails or whatever and there's a
 
02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
negotiation back and forth until you get
 
02:22:17.330 --> 02:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
to the point where the attorneys either
 
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
say now the rule meets the statute it
 
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
does its job
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
okay in which case it goes before the
 
02:22:28.250 --> 02:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
gel car and goes on the consent decree
 
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
if it's if the rule is unobjectionable
 
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
and if it's on the consent committee on
 
02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar any member of the
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
jail car can pull it off just the same
 
02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:42.140 align:start position:0%
way we can pull a rule off a statute off
 
02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's uh in the process of being
 
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
addressed and built voted on in in plan
 
02:22:53.929 --> 02:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
a recession of the legislature uh but
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um uh if it's on the consent calendar or
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
nearly goes through because eternities
 
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
have said this rule Works in terms of it
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't exceed legislative Authority it
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't violate legislative in the
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
process yes follow up follow up
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
so then why
 
02:23:13.070 --> 02:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
why would you be opposed to the standing
 
02:23:15.770 --> 02:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
committee seeing the rule to review it
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
and at least if they so choose
 
02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
have a comment prior to the public
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
comment session
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
why are you opposed to that
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
well the public comment section is not
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
the only bite at the Apple that's a
 
02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
public has after the rule has been
 
02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
worked out it goes to a public session
 
02:23:36.770 --> 02:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
okay a public hearing then then my
 
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
question is why are you opposed to the
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
standing committee
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
having a look at the rule to make a
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
comment if they so choose before the
 
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
public session is done
 
02:23:51.530 --> 02:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
because they've already they've already
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
participated in their part of the
 
02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
legislative process they've come as
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
close as they can to perfecting the rule
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
and the the the bill in the time
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
available and after and the rules only
 
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to implement it
 
02:24:10.130 --> 02:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's that's its job there is a public
 
02:24:13.010 --> 02:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
commentary before the rule is cut even
 
02:24:14.929 --> 02:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
comes to the gel car
 
02:24:17.809 --> 02:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
and when the attorneys sign off on it as
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
I said if they consider it okay and does
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
its job goes on the consent calendar if
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
they have any issues whatsoever
 
02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
where they say we're not comfortable
 
02:24:32.090 --> 02:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
this only the gel car can determine
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to let this rule go
 
02:24:38.210 --> 02:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
go forward and that's a majority vote if
 
02:24:39.889 --> 02:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
there's something that's wrong with the
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
with the rule the gel car can have
 
02:24:45.290 --> 02:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
what's called a joint resolution
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
which then has to go before both bodies
 
02:24:51.170 --> 02:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
and has to be adopted by the legislature
 
02:24:53.929 --> 02:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
because we don't have pocket vetoes in
 
02:24:56.030 --> 02:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire no committee
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
can pocket something in and take it away
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
only the Full House or the full Senate
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
has a say on whether something passes or
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
not it's a system that's flawed like
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
anything human but it works pretty well
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
if you have a competent legislature to
 
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
it and a competent Governor to adopt a
 
02:25:19.370 --> 02:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
good a good law and we know those of us
 
02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
who've been here for a while that there
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
are statutes that get adopted
 
02:25:26.809 --> 02:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
and enacted over Kicking and Screaming
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
of sometimes half of the legislature
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't want it
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then it depends on
 
02:25:35.330 --> 02:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
you know whether the governor will sign
 
02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
it or let it become law it's still a
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
very fragile process in many respects
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
but it's the best thing
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
so I I'm just telling you
 
02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
it works pretty well the way it is and
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
this is gonna
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
screen at the at the at the joints to
 
02:25:59.690 --> 02:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
try to make the situation better than it
 
02:26:02.450 --> 02:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
is now in my opinion I don't I don't
 
02:26:04.849 --> 02:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
think this is as as much work has been
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
done on it I don't think this is ready
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
for prime time
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:26:13.010 --> 02:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
um the chair would like to call the
 
02:26:14.809 --> 02:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
director of administrative rules from
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
and do you have any testimony or just
 
02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
answering questions uh basically just
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
answering questions okay for the record
 
02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Morrow I'm the
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
director of the administrative rules
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
unit within Opera office of legislative
 
02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
Services I've been working for the unit
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
for 30 years
 
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
if you can director and thank you for
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
joining us um just to clarify maybe some
 
02:26:44.450 --> 02:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
of the questions that have been circling
 
02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:45.650 align:start position:0%
of the questions that have been circling
around

02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:46.490 align:start position:0%
around
um

02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
this paragraph that's been under
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussion it's intent if I'm correct is
 
02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the members of the committee would
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
just be apprised of what the rule is so
 
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
that the members could weigh in on any
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
concerns that they have with how it's
 
02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
been constructed and as to whether or
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
not it meant the original intent correct
 
02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't affect its ability
 
02:27:08.330 --> 02:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
to move forward we're not vetoing it or
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
we're not giving it an up or down that's
 
02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:11.389 align:start position:0%
we're not giving it an up or down that's
correct

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
um it's if there's new legislation and
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
then there's a rule to implement that
 
02:27:19.610 --> 02:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
legislation it would go to the policy
 
02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
committee to take a look at to see if
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
they think the rules actually implement
 
02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
the statute correctly or if it's going
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
into creating a new policy
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
Etc then the uh the policy committee
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
would report back to gel Carr and gel
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
car would take that under advisement
 
02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:42.110 align:start position:0%
car would take that under advisement
so

02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:43.309 align:start position:0%
so
if

02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee aren't a
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
prize aren't aware of the rule aren't
 
02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
able to give feedback ahead of time then
 
02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
the rule will be set and that rule
 
02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
without any input will go to jailcar and
 
02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's what gel car is going to
 
02:27:59.570 --> 02:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
basically interpret the agency would
 
02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
initially put in what's called an
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
initial proposal they draft up the rules
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
and say this is what we want to do then
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
they have their public hearing process
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
they may get testimony or not from the
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
public it may be a little maybe a lot
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
they also get comments from my office on
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal we're required by
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
law and by the committee's rules to
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
advise the committee of any potential
 
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
basis for objection there are a lot of
 
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
instances where it's a minor thing in
 
02:28:28.690 --> 02:28:28.700 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
decides it's not worth objecting to or
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
they get an explanation from the
 
02:28:35.090 --> 02:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
agencies saying why that rule is written
 
02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
that way
 
02:28:40.730 --> 02:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
but uh that is a process
 
02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much for
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
joining us thank you did any other
 
02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
member of the public wish to speak uh to
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
02:28:59.450 --> 02:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
hearing and we are in recess until one
 
02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:09.410 align:start position:0%
hearing and we are in recess until one
o'clock

02:29:09.410 --> 02:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair
 
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
I believe it's the intention of our
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
chair that this will go I'm sorry yes
 
02:29:19.490 --> 02:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
this will be um referred to the
 
02:29:20.929 --> 02:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on rules representative
 
03:45:56.330 --> 03:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
welcome to udna I'm opening the public
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and House Bill 274 and I call
 
03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:11.530 --> 03:46:11.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:46:14.150 --> 03:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Lori Sanborn and I represent
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
the beautiful town of Bedford
 
03:46:20.150 --> 03:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
a group of us sponsored Hospital 274 in
 
03:46:22.670 --> 03:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
an effort to reform rulemaking processes
 
03:46:25.010 --> 03:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
and make our state much more friendly to
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire small businesses
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a small business operator myself and
 
03:46:32.210 --> 03:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
was the founder and chair of the New
 
03:46:34.130 --> 03:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house business caucus for many
 
03:46:37.010 --> 03:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
years here and as a group we held
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
numerous round tables with businesses of
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
all different sizes across the state to
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
get their input on ideas and over and
 
03:46:48.410 --> 03:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
over we heard the same feedback that the
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
excessive regulations and the red tape
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
in our state is overly burdensome and
 
03:46:55.490 --> 03:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
makes running running a business here
 
03:46:57.290 --> 03:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
quite frankly very hard and very
 
03:46:57.300 --> 03:46:58.969 align:start position:0%
quite frankly very hard and very
frustrating

03:46:58.969 --> 03:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
frustrating
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I've been contacted more times than I
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
can count by irate small business owners
 
03:47:07.729 --> 03:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
who yell at me for passing a bad Bill
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it comes to turn out we look at what
 
03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
it is what the situation is I stare at
 
03:47:12.889 --> 03:47:12.899 align:start position:0%
them like a deer in the headlights and
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
then we do the research and we realize
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a bill that we ever passed it
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
actually was a rule that was implemented
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
and now someone's coming to make sure
 
03:47:23.389 --> 03:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
they're complying with that rule and no
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
one really even knew about that rule
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
just this past summer I was contacted by
 
03:47:31.190 --> 03:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire farmer who suddenly
 
03:47:33.290 --> 03:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
found an inspector at his doorstep
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
trying to looking for a new license and
 
03:47:39.050 --> 03:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
a whole new compliance and again this is
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
a situation they were complying a new
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
rule we never passed a bill we never
 
03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
passed a policy on the issue but there
 
03:47:48.650 --> 03:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
was a rule that was being enforced and
 
03:47:50.690 --> 03:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
of course exposed this business owner to
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
fear and fines
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
um another example
 
03:47:57.530 --> 03:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
um I got a call from a large retailer
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
who was issued heavy fines for allowing
 
03:48:03.410 --> 03:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
employees to purchase clothing
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
merchandise with his logo on it
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
now what we passed as legislators was a
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
policy that said if you require your
 
03:48:13.849 --> 03:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
employees to wear a company uniform you
 
03:48:15.769 --> 03:48:15.779 align:start position:0%
cannot make them pay for it which is
 
03:48:18.410 --> 03:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
common sense but the rules went really
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
beyond that to extend it to any logoed
 
03:48:24.170 --> 03:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
company merchandise and they got heavy
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
fines for that and had to fight that so
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
this is the type of examples that I keep
 
03:48:31.330 --> 03:48:31.340 align:start position:0%
hearing about and as you probably know
 
03:48:34.010 --> 03:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
rules created by government agencies
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
have the full force and effect as law
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and as a legislature we give you no
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
better than anyone we give this
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
rule-making Authority
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we understand that the agencies are
 
03:48:55.969 --> 03:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
really just trying to clarify and
 
03:48:58.190 --> 03:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
administer what we pass
 
03:49:00.170 --> 03:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
but we just need to make sure that the
 
03:49:02.929 --> 03:49:02.939 align:start position:0%
rules that they promulgate match the
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
scope and the intent of the policy that
 
03:49:08.090 --> 03:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
we passed and sometimes we see that they
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
exceed them and I have seen personally
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
where a one-line change in an RSA has
 
03:49:17.090 --> 03:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
turned into a book of new regulations
 
03:49:20.090 --> 03:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
and literally reams of red tape which
 
03:49:21.889 --> 03:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
can also turn into Hefty fines on our
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
03:49:26.750 --> 03:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
so when I always encourage business
 
03:49:28.969 --> 03:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
owners to come and testify come come and
 
03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
talk to us give us input give us
 
03:49:33.170 --> 03:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
feedback give us feedback especially on
 
03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
these rules when they're being
 
03:49:36.889 --> 03:49:36.899 align:start position:0%
promulgated and most of them have no
 
03:49:40.250 --> 03:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
idea about the process have no idea that
 
03:49:42.349 --> 03:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
stuff that is directly impacting them
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
and their business and their industry is
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
coming up and Rule making they have no
 
03:49:48.290 --> 03:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that and then the folks
 
03:49:49.849 --> 03:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
that have knowledge honestly a little
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
bit they're afraid they're afraid of
 
03:49:51.479 --> 03:49:53.750 align:start position:0%
bit they're afraid they're afraid of
retaliation

03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
retaliation
 
03:49:56.809 --> 03:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
um so that's concerning
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
um what we're trying to do is make sure
 
03:50:02.269 --> 03:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
that this bill ameliates that situation
 
03:50:04.429 --> 03:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
by making sure there is no fear factor
 
03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
of retaliation and that we encourage as
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
much input up front as possible in the
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process
 
03:50:14.570 --> 03:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
particularly by incorporating the policy
 
03:50:16.269 --> 03:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
committee that's involved
 
03:50:19.309 --> 03:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
in that policy area so that up front
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
early on those are the people who
 
03:50:23.809 --> 03:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
understand those rsas can weigh in on
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
the rule making process so it doesn't go
 
03:50:26.990 --> 03:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
too far down the road and we find
 
03:50:30.110 --> 03:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves with a lot more regulation
 
03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
as you can see by the co-sponsors who
 
03:50:34.250 --> 03:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
helped craft this bill which includes
 
03:50:36.290 --> 03:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
speaker Packard Deputy speaker Stephen
 
03:50:39.469 --> 03:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
Smith speaker Emeritus Stephen shurtleff
 
03:50:41.389 --> 03:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh your chair she's around here
 
03:50:43.370 --> 03:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere Senate President Jeffrey
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
Bradley and lots of other esteemed
 
03:50:47.210 --> 03:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
representatives and Senators there's a
 
03:50:49.150 --> 03:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
big group there is a significant
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan concern about the hardships
 
03:50:55.070 --> 03:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
our current rulemaking process imposes
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
on our businesses
 
03:51:00.170 --> 03:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 274 is truly a bipartisan
 
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
effort which is meant to improve the
 
03:51:04.630 --> 03:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process reduce red tape
 
03:51:07.610 --> 03:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
encourage more input to agencies and to
 
03:51:09.769 --> 03:51:09.779 align:start position:0%
gel car early in the process without
 
03:51:09.779 --> 03:51:10.910 align:start position:0%
gel car early in the process without
fear

03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
fear
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that regulations proposed by
 
03:51:15.469 --> 03:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
agencies don't exceed the scope or the
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation we passed and
 
03:51:21.309 --> 03:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
then if gel card does object to the rule
 
03:51:23.630 --> 03:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would say it doesn't move
 
03:51:26.450 --> 03:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
forward because right now as many of you
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
might know if Joe Carr opposes or
 
03:51:31.070 --> 03:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
objects to a rule it still be goes into
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
effect and effectively becomes law
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
so this bill aims to stop that so and I
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
guess you know as a fellow legislature
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
my question to you is whose
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility is it to make law
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
I think most of us would agree that it
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
is our duty as state representatives and
 
03:51:50.510 --> 03:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
Senators to make policy and this is
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
quite clear on our constitution
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
so in summary this bill attempts to make
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable reforms by reinforcing the
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
clear authority of lawmakers to create
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
policy by ensuring that rules do not
 
03:52:05.150 --> 03:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
exceed the scope or the intent of the
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
original legislation and do not create
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or excessive burdens on our
 
03:52:13.370 --> 03:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
state small businesses so we would
 
03:52:15.650 --> 03:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
obviously appreciate your support and
 
03:52:19.370 --> 03:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative true
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:52:28.370 --> 03:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
um on the uh
 
03:52:33.710 --> 03:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
on the addition of
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
I won't be able to find it now we're uh
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of retaliation would they
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
suffer could they suffer and what
 
03:52:49.130 --> 03:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
happens if that retaliation comes about
 
03:52:51.170 --> 03:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
in spite of this bill
 
03:52:53.929 --> 03:52:53.939 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and this
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and I talked about this a
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
little bit is do we put you know what
 
03:52:59.450 --> 03:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
happens if this retaliation how do you
 
03:53:01.490 --> 03:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
enforce this and I'm not sure about that
 
03:53:03.410 --> 03:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
answer but I can tell you I did go to
 
03:53:06.410 --> 03:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
the state employee handbook and there is
 
03:53:08.229 --> 03:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
a clause in there that talks about
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
employees should not retaliate so if
 
03:53:12.530 --> 03:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
someone complains about you harass me
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
there isn't no retaliation Clause there
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:53:18.290 --> 03:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
like most businesses you have to manage
 
03:53:20.150 --> 03:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
that on a case-by-case basis to some
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
extent but I think it would give
 
03:53:25.370 --> 03:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
the business Community citizens a little
 
03:53:28.490 --> 03:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
bit more relief knowing that it's
 
03:53:29.690 --> 03:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
expected that there would be no
 
03:53:31.729 --> 03:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
retaliation and I have heard and who
 
03:53:34.130 --> 03:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
knows if this is true or not but a
 
03:53:37.490 --> 03:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
business has gone to testify uh and
 
03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
critique rules and they suddenly get an
 
03:53:43.250 --> 03:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
audit or an inspector and that we just
 
03:53:45.170 --> 03:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
we we really want to make sure that
 
03:53:47.210 --> 03:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
people aren't afraid to communicate with
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
their government so that's what this
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:00.530 --> 03:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
I I have one um so you stated that with
 
03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
this in place of gel car
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
um disagrees with the rule that it would
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
put a stop to the rule is that correct
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes what would be the next steps after
 
03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:12.050 align:start position:0%
yes what would be the next steps after
that

03:54:12.050 --> 03:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:13.250 --> 03:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
because assumingly they're they're
 
03:54:14.929 --> 03:54:14.939 align:start position:0%
putting a rule into place because of a
 
03:54:16.490 --> 03:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
statute that we've written is that
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
correct or is this well they they could
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
continually go back and and redraft it
 
03:54:23.990 --> 03:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay yes so there'd be no limitations on
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
the number of redrafts until we got it
 
03:54:26.279 --> 03:54:27.349 align:start position:0%
the number of redrafts until we got it
right

03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:54:29.570 --> 03:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
awesome yeah
 
03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.859 --> 03:54:48.469 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:48.479 --> 03:54:53.929 align:start position:0%
 
colleagues

03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:57.229 --> 03:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
as haven't been before you for minutes
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
03:55:01.849 --> 03:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
so I would like to uh State my
 
03:55:04.630 --> 03:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect again having
 
03:55:11.210 --> 03:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
served for 16 years on gel car
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
I I would say uh it's already in our
 
03:55:17.530 --> 03:55:17.540 align:start position:0%
mandates that
 
03:55:17.540 --> 03:55:17.809 align:start position:0%
mandates that
[Music]

03:55:17.809 --> 03:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:55:17.819 --> 03:55:19.189 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
a rule cannot exceed legislative
 
03:55:21.960 --> 03:55:23.210 align:start position:0%
a rule cannot exceed legislative
Authority

03:55:23.210 --> 03:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
nor can it violate legislative intent so
 
03:55:29.210 --> 03:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
if it's already in our mandates and our
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
rules that those two things cannot
 
03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:32.809 align:start position:0%
rules that those two things cannot
happen

03:55:32.809 --> 03:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:55:35.389 --> 03:55:35.399 align:start position:0%
what would this bill do by stating it
 
03:55:38.150 --> 03:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
again and kind of shaking its finger and
 
03:55:41.210 --> 03:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
say but this time we really mean it
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
because if it's already illegal or
 
03:55:48.290 --> 03:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
against the rule then making another set
 
03:55:50.450 --> 03:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
of rules that say essentially the same
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
thing is a uh wish in
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
in place of uh promise because
 
03:56:03.050 --> 03:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh if the current rules are being
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
flouted which I would deny that they are
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh because uh I have served and I've
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
seen very rarely a case where
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
um something which was clearly improper
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
under the rules and I will give you an
 
03:56:22.010 --> 03:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
example in a moment uh I went through in
 
03:56:23.870 --> 03:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that it was prohibited
 
03:56:26.929 --> 03:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
and so we had a bill I mentioned this in
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee some time ago but it's very
 
03:56:30.670 --> 03:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate right now
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
that we had a bill to ban smoking in
 
03:56:37.130 --> 03:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
restaurants and bars
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
um there was no authorization for any
 
03:56:40.610 --> 03:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh punishment or fine but without the
 
03:56:48.769 --> 03:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
hammer of a fine or punishment then the
 
03:56:51.670 --> 03:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
statute could easily be bloated
 
03:56:55.490 --> 03:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
and there would be no punishment
 
03:56:58.969 --> 03:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
um so the agency recognizing that no
 
03:57:02.570 --> 03:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hammer no compliance or at least you're
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
inviting contempt for the statute if you
 
03:57:09.469 --> 03:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
have no sanction the agency put in a
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar administrative fine the gel
 
03:57:14.809 --> 03:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
car attorneys immediately said in the
 
03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
report when we were hearing that rule
 
03:57:19.370 --> 03:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
without foundation in other words it
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
would exceed legislative intent
 
03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we
 
03:57:28.969 --> 03:57:28.979 align:start position:0%
mild age what's called a joint
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
resolution and that stopped that aspect
 
03:57:35.150 --> 03:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
from going into effect
 
03:57:37.969 --> 03:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
um and but the but the committee in the
 
03:57:39.769 --> 03:57:39.779 align:start position:0%
house recognized that without the
 
03:57:42.349 --> 03:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
sanction there would be no enforcement
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
effectively and so they said we're going
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
to give the state the authority to
 
03:57:52.130 --> 03:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
sanction and they allowed they changed
 
03:57:56.450 --> 03:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
the statute to permit a you know an
 
03:57:58.910 --> 03:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
administrative fine because they
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
recognize that that otherwise it was
 
03:58:03.250 --> 03:58:03.260 align:start position:0%
unworkable so
 
03:58:07.450 --> 03:58:07.460 align:start position:0%
it represents Sanborn is speaking from
 
03:58:10.729 --> 03:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
hearsay I think because I've been on gel
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
car for 16 years and and and in the
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
house for 20 years and she hasn't been
 
03:58:20.150 --> 03:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
on on gel car in all those times so she
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
can't be speaking from experience
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
because I've been there the whole time
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
she's been in the house and she hasn't
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
been there so I can tell you for a fact
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
that the attorneys are enforcing the
 
03:58:35.990 --> 03:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
rules of gel car and rules that do not
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
comply with the statute because they
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
either exceed legislative Authority or
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
they are contrary to legislative intent
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
there they do not go forward and even in
 
03:58:49.130 --> 03:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
the time there is one aspect that she
 
03:58:51.410 --> 03:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
may be represents Sanborn may be
 
03:58:51.420 --> 03:58:52.969 align:start position:0%
may be represents Sanborn may be
referencing

03:58:52.969 --> 03:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
03:58:55.729 --> 03:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
um which deserves a moment of attention
 
03:58:57.530 --> 03:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
I didn't speak about this in the
 
03:59:00.170 --> 03:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
previous hearing and that is there are
 
03:59:03.050 --> 03:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
two levels of stop signs the first one
 
03:59:05.929 --> 03:59:05.939 align:start position:0%
is called a preliminary objection and
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
when a rule comes before us that has
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
some problem the attorneys have brought
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
it to our attention we agree with them
 
03:59:15.530 --> 03:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
that this is improper we can there's no
 
03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
there there's no Authority and and we
 
03:59:20.410 --> 03:59:20.420 align:start position:0%
we're not going to permit that
 
03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
then we file a preliminary objection the
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
the agency then has 45 days to come back
 
03:59:30.710 --> 03:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
to us with a fix of that problem
 
03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
or overwhelmingly uh they come they come
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
back within that period and they have
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
fixed the problem
 
03:59:40.610 --> 03:59:40.620 align:start position:0%
and then the rule can go into effect
 
03:59:44.090 --> 03:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
um if they don't uh then we can file
 
03:59:46.450 --> 03:59:46.460 align:start position:0%
what's called a per a final objection
 
03:59:51.530 --> 03:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
and in those cases the agency can
 
03:59:51.540 --> 03:59:53.030 align:start position:0%
and in those cases the agency can
can

03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
file the rule but
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
they are on their own if they do they
 
04:00:00.410 --> 04:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
don't the state will not stand behind
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
them and the net effect of that is
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
agencies don't want to do that
 
04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
they just don't they don't want to go
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
out there effectively with no State
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
backing and so in my 16 years I think it
 
04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
is a final objection uh being
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
disregarded and the rule being
 
04:00:23.689 --> 04:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
implemented has happened
 
04:00:26.929 --> 04:00:26.939 align:start position:0%
I think maybe once maybe not at all in
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
16 years so these these strictures
 
04:00:32.929 --> 04:00:32.939 align:start position:0%
can't exceed legislative Authority
 
04:00:35.090 --> 04:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
cannot buy be contrary to legislative
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
intent they are real stop signs and very
 
04:00:41.809 --> 04:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
rarely have we had a joint resolution I
 
04:00:43.729 --> 04:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
gave you an example of one of the two
 
04:00:46.610 --> 04:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
times I think and so
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
this this is not this is not a bill that
 
04:00:53.450 --> 04:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
will work in my opinion it certainly
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
will not improve the situation gel car
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
already Works uh if you have a situation
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
where where an agency might overstep its
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
own rules
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh by being heavy-handed or something
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's not something that fixing the gel
 
04:01:13.250 --> 04:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
car process would address in any way
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
because if a if an agency is going to
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
violate the law
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh and they're going to violate the law
 
04:01:22.370 --> 04:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
and no matter what the law says right so
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is not the case
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh and in any case if an agency
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
is heavy-handed then they can be sued
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
and they've and agencies are sued and
 
04:01:35.570 --> 04:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
they're stopped with the court deems
 
04:01:38.330 --> 04:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
that they have violated the statute so
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
I'll stop at this point and you can ask
 
04:01:42.290 --> 04:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
04:01:47.090 --> 04:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
04:01:48.590 --> 04:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:01:51.410 --> 04:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
um you stated there were two types of
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
stop signs from Joker they're more than
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
two but they're two primary pillars
 
04:01:58.130 --> 04:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
those are the ones I've cited several
 
04:01:58.140 --> 04:01:59.570 align:start position:0%
those are the ones I've cited several
times

04:01:59.570 --> 04:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
times
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's a financial there's a financial
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
aspect but that's usually not the case
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
and and the and the fourth one is also
 
04:02:09.170 --> 04:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
very infrequent the two that really are
 
04:02:11.330 --> 04:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
the stop signs are can't exceed
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority it can be counter
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh all right so the the
 
04:02:22.969 --> 04:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection
 
04:02:25.370 --> 04:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
you were saying stops the rule for 45
 
04:02:28.429 --> 04:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
days the agency can rewrite the final
 
04:02:31.130 --> 04:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
objection doesn't stop the rule
 
04:02:31.140 --> 04:02:32.510 align:start position:0%
objection doesn't stop the rule
but

04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
this bill would give joeca the authority
 
04:02:37.010 --> 04:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
to stop the rule
 
04:02:39.170 --> 04:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
I don't see that it could give gel car
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
well I think it would give the Joker the
 
04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
authority to just the process as I see
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
it is an expanded process because
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
um there would be much more committee
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
involvement the rules would go back to
 
04:02:54.650 --> 04:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
the Committees for them to weigh in on
 
04:02:58.729 --> 04:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
whether something was uh in in improper
 
04:03:01.250 --> 04:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
but as I said in my earlier testimony
 
04:03:03.170 --> 04:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
what happens if you have a divided
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
committee a a bill narrowly passed the
 
04:03:09.469 --> 04:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
committee you know by one or two votes
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
but it's still an ought to pass
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
it goes and it gets adopted by the other
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
body after passing the house uh the
 
04:03:20.210 --> 04:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
governor signs it then it's the law and
 
04:03:22.490 --> 04:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
I I think if you're going to say that
 
04:03:24.889 --> 04:03:24.899 align:start position:0%
this law will stop it but that law won't
 
04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
stop it I I don't accept that premise
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.710 --> 04:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
although thank you it's not a
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
preliminary final objection is not a a
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
stop sign it says
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
you you are you are you are putting this
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
rule into into effect against our
 
04:03:46.920 --> 04:03:48.469 align:start position:0%
rule into into effect against our
recommendation

04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
against our final objection but they
 
04:03:53.809 --> 04:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
still have the authority if they think
 
04:03:55.969 --> 04:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
because the agencies have certain
 
04:03:57.889 --> 04:03:57.899 align:start position:0%
Authority and if they think they're
 
04:04:01.130 --> 04:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
right and they're basically saying we
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
think the courts will will believe us
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
and not the not the gel car but and I'm
 
04:04:09.650 --> 04:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
telling you in 16 years that has rarely
 
04:04:13.010 --> 04:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
if ever happened that's important rarely
 
04:04:14.330 --> 04:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
if ever happens
 
04:04:17.090 --> 04:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you but we as you read house bill
 
04:04:17.100 --> 04:04:19.189 align:start position:0%
thank you but we as you read house bill
274.

04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
274.
 
04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's giving Joker
 
04:04:23.570 --> 04:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
a stronger
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
weapon to block a rule
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I I don't think it's
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
really stronger because if the agency is
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
going to defy the law they're going to
 
04:04:36.170 --> 04:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
defy the law and then they need to be
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.170 --> 04:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you we could go
 
04:04:44.210 --> 04:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
paragraph by paragraph and I could say
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is not unwise un unproductive thank
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
you representative any other questions
 
04:04:55.969 --> 04:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:06.370 --> 04:05:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
need to turn the mic on
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
um for the record I am Sean Jasper
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:05:15.229 --> 04:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food and I hear
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill
 
04:05:20.090 --> 04:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
I've been on both sides of this I served
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
four years on gel Carr as a legislator
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
and after that I figured I had done my
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
Penance and could could move on to other
 
04:05:31.729 --> 04:05:31.739 align:start position:0%
endeavors and I admire those such as the
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
previous speaker who has been there for
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
16 years
 
04:05:35.760 --> 04:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
16 years
um

04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
I understand fully the intent of the
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislation and I know the sponsors of
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
this bill very well admire them uh
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
as a member of gel Carr I worked very
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
hard with the leadership at that time to
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
make reforms and we did make a number
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
and this was back in the early 90s uh
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
the process was much worse back then
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
others will speak to the fact that the
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
courts have have determined that a
 
04:06:05.570 --> 04:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee cannot stop a law from being
 
04:06:08.150 --> 04:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
implemented so I think you'll find that
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
that part of it is not legal that only
 
04:06:13.130 --> 04:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
the legislature can actually do that
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
because of the authority granted now
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you as a a department head
 
04:06:21.410 --> 04:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
I would love nothing better than to not
 
04:06:25.010 --> 04:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
have any rules to implement I have never
 
04:06:27.849 --> 04:06:27.859 align:start position:0%
been before a committee and asked for
 
04:06:30.170 --> 04:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
the power to create rules the
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is always pretty much said
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
well we like the idea of this law but we
 
04:06:36.650 --> 04:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
really don't know how to implement it so
 
04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
so you do the rules so I mean I think
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's a little bipolar to be now coming
 
04:06:45.650 --> 04:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
back and saying yeah but we want to have
 
04:06:48.410 --> 04:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
this Authority and I I don't think there
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
are too many department heads who
 
04:06:54.410 --> 04:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say just write the rules into
 
04:06:57.290 --> 04:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
the law if you can figure that out you
 
04:07:00.050 --> 04:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
know God bless you you ask us to do a
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
very good a very tough job which
 
04:07:05.689 --> 04:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
requires a tremendous amount of of Staff
 
04:07:05.699 --> 04:07:06.830 align:start position:0%
requires a tremendous amount of of Staff
time

04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:07:09.769 --> 04:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to speak to some specifics
 
04:07:12.290 --> 04:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
in here on uh
 
04:07:15.290 --> 04:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
page two uh
 
04:07:20.090 --> 04:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
line 27 it talks about legislation that
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
was voted on by the committee
 
04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
many of our rules go back decades and I
 
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
would suggest that in some cases every
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
single member of a committee who put
 
04:07:35.210 --> 04:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
forward the Authority for us to adopt a
 
04:07:37.370 --> 04:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
rule is probably long deceased let alone
 
04:07:40.250 --> 04:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
no longer in the legislature so you're
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
giving a lot of authority to a committee
 
04:07:46.210 --> 04:07:46.220 align:start position:0%
that didn't hear the initial
 
04:07:49.070 --> 04:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
proposal for the law to begin with
 
04:07:51.950 --> 04:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
and then giving them the ability to to
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
interpret what that legislature intended
 
04:07:58.849 --> 04:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
many decades ago
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
if you move on to page three
 
04:08:06.650 --> 04:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
um starting really on line two the
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
agencies shall verify that the rule does
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
not exceed the policy or intent of the
 
04:08:14.090 --> 04:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
statute there's only one legislator
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
whose head I've ever gotten inside of
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that was my own
 
04:08:22.130 --> 04:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I will never sign
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
such a statement saying that I know what
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislature was unless
 
04:08:31.010 --> 04:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
in very clear terms legislative intent
 
04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
is part of the statute
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise it is left up to
 
04:08:37.610 --> 04:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to what the intent is
 
04:08:40.130 --> 04:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to verify what someone
 
04:08:43.130 --> 04:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
else some years before
 
04:08:45.950 --> 04:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
um verified so we'll just stop doing
 
04:08:48.050 --> 04:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
inspections we'll stop collecting fees
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
because our rules will all expire
 
04:08:52.910 --> 04:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
because as long as I'm commissioner I'm
 
04:08:55.010 --> 04:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
not going to violate my own personal
 
04:08:57.889 --> 04:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
ethics by making a statement that I have
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
no idea whether it's true or not I can't
 
04:09:01.729 --> 04:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:09:05.110 --> 04:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
moving down to line 35 on the same page
 
04:09:07.610 --> 04:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
a narrative stating the cost and
 
04:09:10.969 --> 04:09:10.979 align:start position:0%
benefits to those affected by the rule
 
04:09:14.450 --> 04:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
probably in most cases most businesses
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
would say there is no benefit to the
 
04:09:18.650 --> 04:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
rule to them
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
rules are largely to protect the
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
citizens of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:09:25.729 --> 04:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
and so again how would I possibly do
 
04:09:28.189 --> 04:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
that when I don't believe that the rules
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
were passed for the benefit of those
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
we're regulating
 
04:09:36.050 --> 04:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
go on to line one of the next page
 
04:09:38.090 --> 04:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
include an estimate of the cost to
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
implement the proposed Rule and the cost
 
04:09:42.650 --> 04:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
to those affected adhering to the rule
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
again I could never possibly do that and
 
04:09:47.929 --> 04:09:47.939 align:start position:0%
I would tell you that every business is
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
substantially different
 
04:09:52.130 --> 04:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
um we have been enforcing the fisma
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
rules which
 
04:09:57.290 --> 04:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
um have to do with food safety we could
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
either do it or the feds could do it and
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
everybody decided that the state of New
 
04:10:02.809 --> 04:10:02.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was better doing that but I
 
04:10:05.330 --> 04:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
can tell you in those Enforcement cases
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
that the cost to the businesses vary
 
04:10:12.410 --> 04:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
greatly under food safety modernization
 
04:10:16.130 --> 04:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
we had two cases last year of listeria
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
and apples the end result was
 
04:10:23.330 --> 04:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
one Farm had to replace their entire
 
04:10:26.689 --> 04:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
packing Lobby line because it was put in
 
04:10:28.729 --> 04:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
back in the 50s and could not be
 
04:10:32.210 --> 04:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
modernized others simply did sanitation
 
04:10:32.220 --> 04:10:33.110 align:start position:0%
modernized others simply did sanitation
work

04:10:33.110 --> 04:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:10:36.110 --> 04:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
and so costs are going to vary I could
 
04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
not do that I wouldn't submit rules with
 
04:10:38.160 --> 04:10:39.830 align:start position:0%
not do that I wouldn't submit rules with
that

04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
moving down to line 20
 
04:10:45.889 --> 04:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
that the notice of period shall not end
 
04:10:47.809 --> 04:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
before the submission of the rule I
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
think this is highly unfair to the
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
agency and to perhaps those who are
 
04:10:56.929 --> 04:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
intending to make comment because if
 
04:10:59.570 --> 04:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
they come in at the very end
 
04:11:02.570 --> 04:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
we couldn't possibly take those comments
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
into effect but you're giving them the
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh the false idea that if they uh
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
provide comment on the last day the
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
agency is going to be able to take their
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
comments into account that's simply not
 
04:11:17.090 --> 04:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
possible there needs to be an end time
 
04:11:20.150 --> 04:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the ability for us to take those
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
comments into consideration
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
moving on to page five line
 
04:11:30.370 --> 04:11:30.380 align:start position:0%
12 through 14 again
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
that the the agency submit that
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
verification again can't do that
 
04:11:40.250 --> 04:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh line
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
33 34 about retaliation that's a very
 
04:11:45.889 --> 04:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
difficult thing
 
04:11:49.370 --> 04:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
to measure I can tell you that people
 
04:11:51.170 --> 04:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
have said oh they won't talk to me
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
because they're fear of retaliation even
 
04:11:55.130 --> 04:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
though I have no ability as commissioner
 
04:11:58.610 --> 04:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
really to retaliate against anybody
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
but if we go in and enforce the rules as
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
they are written would be easy enough
 
04:12:06.170 --> 04:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
for someone to say this is retaliation
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
what does that mean how is that
 
04:12:08.520 --> 04:12:09.950 align:start position:0%
what does that mean how is that
investigated

04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know what are you going to do to
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
verify that I think that's a very
 
04:12:17.150 --> 04:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
slippery slope I think there needs to be
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
and I think there are ways for people to
 
04:12:21.530 --> 04:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
deal with that people go to the
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office if they feel an agency
 
04:12:26.450 --> 04:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
is retaliating and and that is the more
 
04:12:28.610 --> 04:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to deal with that going
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
to the next page
 
04:12:31.319 --> 04:12:32.030 align:start position:0%
to the next page
um

04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:34.729 --> 04:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
pay uh line 12 for rules proposed by
 
04:12:36.650 --> 04:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
board commission or an agency overseen
 
04:12:38.450 --> 04:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
by a board or Commission
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I have an agricultural advisory
 
04:12:43.729 --> 04:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
committee does this apply
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
they advise me
 
04:12:48.290 --> 04:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
so they're overseeing you're requesting
 
04:12:49.849 --> 04:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in here that a majority come
 
04:12:52.250 --> 04:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
to the hearings that's not going to
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
happen they're a volunteer board that by
 
04:12:57.050 --> 04:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
Statute is only required to meet twice a
 
04:12:57.060 --> 04:12:58.309 align:start position:0%
Statute is only required to meet twice a
year

04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:13:02.170 --> 04:13:02.180 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's a consideration
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
I'm moving on to page nine again same
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
same concern on line 15.
 
04:13:12.170 --> 04:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
over to page
 
04:13:12.180 --> 04:13:14.150 align:start position:0%
over to page
um

04:13:14.150 --> 04:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
10 about the final objection and denying
 
04:13:19.490 --> 04:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
the rule I've already spoken to that
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
others will as well
 
04:13:22.680 --> 04:13:26.630 align:start position:0%
others will as well
and

04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:26.640 --> 04:13:27.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:13:27.530 --> 04:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
page 14 the reasons for
 
04:13:34.010 --> 04:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
failures a majority vote for by the
 
04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
house or Senate policy committee to deny
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
the rule that's a very dangerous area to
 
04:13:40.250 --> 04:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
get into that's why you have gel car to
 
04:13:43.490 --> 04:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
look at those these things again one
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
policy committee should not be allowed
 
04:13:48.530 --> 04:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
to speak for for the body or the
 
04:13:51.170 --> 04:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
committee that adopted the rule rather
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
it be two sessions before or 25 sessions
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
before that shouldn't be allowed to stop
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
stop the rule they can certainly come
 
04:14:00.530 --> 04:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
make their objections to the committee
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
talk to the agency but that should not
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
be a reason for denying a rule uh with
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
that I will end my testimony and be
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes representative Lucas
 
04:14:18.110 --> 04:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean there are some I I think
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'd have questions on but I know this is
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee yes yes um if you
 
04:14:22.920 --> 04:14:24.050 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee yes yes um if you
could

04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:14:26.450 --> 04:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
not looking for some long document but
 
04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
maybe even a copy of this uh Mark or at
 
04:14:30.170 --> 04:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
least a list of page and line numbers
 
04:14:32.330 --> 04:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
and at least a brief phrase or something
 
04:14:33.889 --> 04:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
indicating what your concern is about
 
04:14:36.370 --> 04:14:36.380 align:start position:0%
each one so we can look at them
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
separately and
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
I can I can do that all right thank you
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hewitt
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
um I have some questions but I think
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
they would be more directly uh to
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
someone representing gel Carr are they
 
04:14:59.809 --> 04:14:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you commissioner thank
 
04:15:05.760 --> 04:15:07.370 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you commissioner thank
you

04:15:07.370 --> 04:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:15:10.750 --> 04:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
oh sure I'm sorry
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you
 
04:15:13.620 --> 04:15:15.050 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you
so

04:15:15.050 --> 04:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that I have when
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.120 --> 04:15:22.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:15:22.010 --> 04:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:23.809 --> 04:15:23.819 align:start position:0%
jive with what the intent of the
 
04:15:25.969 --> 04:15:25.979 align:start position:0%
legislation was
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
I suspect that in some cases it's
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
because legislation was written well
 
04:15:31.439 --> 04:15:32.689 align:start position:0%
because legislation was written well
so

04:15:32.689 --> 04:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
my concern for this bill is that it puts
 
04:15:38.570 --> 04:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
the onus on rulemaking as opposed to
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
Clarity and legislation
 
04:15:43.969 --> 04:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
can you comment on that please I would I
 
04:15:46.130 --> 04:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
would agree with that and and many times
 
04:15:50.570 --> 04:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
in statute it says commissioner shall
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
adopt rules as he deems necessary
 
04:15:57.769 --> 04:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean how do how do I
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
verify that but those are in many
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
statutes as he he or she deems necessary
 
04:16:06.769 --> 04:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
if the legislature wants more clarity as
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
I said at the opening my opening
 
04:16:11.090 --> 04:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
statement then I think the legislature
 
04:16:13.130 --> 04:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
needs to put that Clarity in and perhaps
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
write the rules themselves I would like
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
to make one other comment which I
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
04:16:21.650 --> 04:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor indicated that an
 
04:16:24.530 --> 04:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
inspector went to a farm so other than
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
Dairy sanitation all the inspectors will
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
go to the to the farm or from my agency
 
04:16:32.689 --> 04:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage anyone who feels
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
that my inspectors are not treating
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
people correctly to come to me this is
 
04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
the first time I've heard about this
 
04:16:41.570 --> 04:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
this is very disturbing to me I'd like
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to address address those
 
04:16:45.889 --> 04:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
issues because that is not something
 
04:16:47.809 --> 04:16:47.819 align:start position:0%
that I ever want to want to hear about
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
and this is the first time I've heard
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
that because our our intent in going out
 
04:16:55.309 --> 04:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
been dealing with with the people we
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
regulate is to help them comply with the
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
rules never to First threaten them or to
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
find them we understand the difficulty
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
of rules and so we're more about that
 
04:17:09.530 --> 04:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
first time out there dealing with the
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
education of what you need to do to
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
comply and so I would very much like to
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
hear the details of that thank you very
 
04:17:15.600 --> 04:17:20.090 align:start position:0%
hear the details of that thank you very
much

04:17:20.090 --> 04:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%

red deer farm in New Hampshire
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
the oldest Red Deer farm in the state
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the largest so I have had some
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
issues with rule making
 
04:17:56.809 --> 04:17:56.819 align:start position:0%
some other things about me I am past
 
04:17:59.210 --> 04:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
president of the northeastern elk
 
04:18:01.490 --> 04:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
Farmers member of the live chairman of
 
04:18:03.309 --> 04:18:03.319 align:start position:0%

a while been doing this for 29 years on
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
my grandparents farm so the Barn's been
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
in I do rise in support of the bill
 
04:18:23.090 --> 04:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
um a couple of stories as I go through
 
04:18:23.100 --> 04:18:24.469 align:start position:0%
um a couple of stories as I go through
here

04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:18:24.479 --> 04:18:25.550 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:28.250 --> 04:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
that that affects us as deer Farmers
 
04:18:30.110 --> 04:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
which is a little unique than some of
 
04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
the other Farmers I actually fall under
 
04:18:32.220 --> 04:18:33.530 align:start position:0%
the other Farmers I actually fall under
three

04:18:33.530 --> 04:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:18:36.530 --> 04:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
organizations now uh
 
04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture which deals
 
04:18:40.969 --> 04:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
with the health issues with the deer and
 
04:18:43.490 --> 04:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with them and the
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
import licensing I think that's a good
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
job for them to be doing but then I also
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
fall under fishing game because I happen
 
04:18:55.130 --> 04:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
to have deer now these are not deer like
 
04:18:57.889 --> 04:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
the deer that run around in the woods in
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is their
 
04:19:02.450 --> 04:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility but these are livestock
 
04:19:05.090 --> 04:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
deer they're European Red Deer they will
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
not breed with our native deer so they
 
04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
really don't affect the native deer
 
04:19:10.800 --> 04:19:12.290 align:start position:0%
really don't affect the native deer
population

04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:19:15.290 --> 04:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
but I do have a whole set of rules
 
04:19:17.630 --> 04:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
called the 800 rules from the fish and
 
04:19:18.969 --> 04:19:18.979 align:start position:0%
game department
 
04:19:22.250 --> 04:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I understand that they're being
 
04:19:24.889 --> 04:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
Rewritten at the moment they're revising
 
04:19:27.170 --> 04:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
them but I haven't seen anything of it
 
04:19:29.570 --> 04:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
and nobody from Fish and Game
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
has contacted me about
 
04:19:35.450 --> 04:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
any input
 
04:19:38.689 --> 04:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
um which and then I also fall under
 
04:19:42.290 --> 04:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services because I sell
 
04:19:45.250 --> 04:19:45.260 align:start position:0%
frozen meat and that's one of the rules
 
04:19:49.849 --> 04:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.859 --> 04:19:51.229 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:19:55.250 --> 04:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
have been missing 29 years like I said
 
04:19:59.710 --> 04:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh about nine years into it after
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
researching a lot about when what we had
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
to do to have a deer farm and be able to
 
04:20:07.130 --> 04:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
sell meat
 
04:20:07.140 --> 04:20:07.849 align:start position:0%
sell meat
um

04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:10.849 --> 04:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
I ran into
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
a person from Health and Human Services
 
04:20:16.250 --> 04:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
that said oh by the way now
 
04:20:20.510 --> 04:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
we put into the rules a new category
 
04:20:23.450 --> 04:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
called frozen meat
 
04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
it had been there for six months or so
 
04:20:28.969 --> 04:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
before I was anyone was notified and I
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
found out about it at a farm bureau
 
04:20:30.960 --> 04:20:31.790 align:start position:0%
found out about it at a farm bureau
meeting

04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:20:33.650 --> 04:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
and nobody else in the livestock
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
committee or other people selling meat
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
had heard of it either
 
04:20:38.340 --> 04:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
had heard of it either
the

04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
so there wasn't a fine but there was
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
certainly a discussion and I brought
 
04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
that person in from Health and Human
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
Services to talk to the livestock
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee and talk to Farm Bureau but it
 
04:20:54.410 --> 04:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
would have been nice before they came
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
and told me that I needed a license
 
04:20:59.689 --> 04:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
which cost me a hundred dollars
 
04:21:03.170 --> 04:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
and the meat that I'm selling
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
comes from a USDA Slaughter plant which
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
is another requirement of the state of
 
04:21:10.189 --> 04:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Health and Human
 
04:21:15.710 --> 04:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
Services not the USDA under USDA my meat
 
04:21:18.530 --> 04:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
does not have to be inspected it's
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
what's called non-amenable species I
 
04:21:24.130 --> 04:21:24.140 align:start position:0%
actually have to pay
 
04:21:27.530 --> 04:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
seventy nine dollars an hour to have my
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
meat inspected
 
04:21:32.330 --> 04:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
so it's an added expense on that the
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
license from Health and Human Services
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
cost me a hundred dollars a year
 
04:21:38.990 --> 04:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing for it to inspect
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
I do get an inspector that appears once
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
in a while and we talk about my freezer
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
which is the only thing I have
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
they can't tell me what the temperature
 
04:21:53.210 --> 04:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be the only comment I get
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
when I ask what temperature is Frozen
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh give me work to go on we have
 
04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
so that is one of the reasons I think
 
04:22:11.090 --> 04:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more input from the
 
04:22:14.330 --> 04:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
public the licensees and even those of
 
04:22:17.689 --> 04:22:17.699 align:start position:0%
us I didn't have a license at that time
 
04:22:19.729 --> 04:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
so there would be no way for them to
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
notify me
 
04:22:24.050 --> 04:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
but I am a member of The Producers under
 
04:22:26.030 --> 04:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
the fishing game though the thing that
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
makes it really unique for what I do in
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
their rules is I have to have a license
 
04:22:34.130 --> 04:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
not a big deal
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
now it gets expensive because I actually
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
have to do an annual report every year
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
of the number of deer I have how many
 
04:22:44.269 --> 04:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
have died how many slaughtered there's a
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
report that I have to do I have to have
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
my vat
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
visit the farm
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the fall and say that my deer are all
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
healthy and submit a letter to fish and
 
04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
game that cost me somewhere between 350
 
04:23:01.130 --> 04:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
and 400 dollars
 
04:23:03.790 --> 04:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
to have that happen
 
04:23:07.130 --> 04:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
on with all the reporting I've got
 
04:23:10.330 --> 04:23:10.340 align:start position:0%
fencing requirements
 
04:23:15.650 --> 04:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
other issues with the 800 rules that
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
other Farms like a sheep farm or a
 
04:23:21.410 --> 04:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
cattle farm don't have to deal with
 
04:23:21.420 --> 04:23:23.150 align:start position:0%
cattle farm don't have to deal with
so

04:23:23.150 --> 04:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:25.729 --> 04:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
more input into the rules is important
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
to me with fish and game and so forth if
 
04:23:32.750 --> 04:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
you got anything else on my notes Here
 
04:23:32.760 --> 04:23:39.410 align:start position:0%
you got anything else on my notes Here
uh

04:23:39.410 --> 04:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:39.420 --> 04:23:41.469 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:23:41.469 --> 04:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:23:45.050 --> 04:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
most of what I have uh I invite any of
 
04:23:46.849 --> 04:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
the legislature that would like to to
 
04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
come visit the farm
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
I've done several legislative tours
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
there and enjoy having you all visit
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm available for any questions
 
04:24:00.290 --> 04:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Adrian any questions yes
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative Gayheart thank you
 
04:24:02.399 --> 04:24:03.530 align:start position:0%
representative Gayheart thank you
chairman

04:24:03.530 --> 04:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
the well first off there's an elk Farm
 
04:24:07.969 --> 04:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
actually it butts my property in Belmont
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know that one but it's pretty
 
04:24:11.929 --> 04:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
cool seeing the elk every day
 
04:24:13.969 --> 04:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
um question is had there been any
 
04:24:17.330 --> 04:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
instances of deer escaping and causing
 
04:24:17.340 --> 04:24:18.830 align:start position:0%
instances of deer escaping and causing
problems

04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
um not escaping and causing problems as
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
far as I know the deer that I'm raising
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
are very much a herd animal and they're
 
04:24:28.130 --> 04:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
very territorial
 
04:24:31.370 --> 04:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
the hardest thing I've got is to
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
get them to go through Gates that I want
 
04:24:36.110 --> 04:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
them to go through so I have to work on
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
that continuously because they like to
 
04:24:42.729 --> 04:24:42.739 align:start position:0%
stay inside now if one wanders outside
 
04:24:45.170 --> 04:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
because it's curious if I could just
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
stop yours it's not really a question
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's applicable to the bill itself so
 
04:24:51.769 --> 04:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna well if you want to follow
 
04:24:53.450 --> 04:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
up with something but yeah being that
 
04:24:55.610 --> 04:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
your game monitors your offenses that's
 
04:24:56.570 --> 04:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
why I'll bring it up you said they
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
monitored the fences and so forth is
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
that what you were saying in your
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
testimony once again representative
 
04:25:00.239 --> 04:25:01.370 align:start position:0%
testimony once again representative
Gerard

04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
Gerard
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's a it's it's an interesting aspect
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
of the conversation but it's not
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
particular to the build the bill doesn't
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
deal with fencing for for fish and game
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
that you're now required to take your
 
04:25:31.790 --> 04:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
meat to a particular slaughterhouse is
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
that correct under the present time
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
under that license agreement it says
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
that it has to be USDA inspected me yes
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay I seems like I recall I'll follow
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
up sorry
 
04:25:49.490 --> 04:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
it seems like I recall a bill a few
 
04:25:52.729 --> 04:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
years ago that made that
 
04:25:55.370 --> 04:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
um a mandatory thing and I honestly
 
04:25:58.610 --> 04:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
don't recall if it passed was that what
 
04:26:00.110 --> 04:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
affected you
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
um to have to do that
 
04:26:02.220 --> 04:26:04.429 align:start position:0%
um to have to do that
uh

04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think it appears representative
 
04:26:09.610 --> 04:26:09.620 align:start position:0%
McGuire representative Maguire
 
04:26:14.809 --> 04:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
if I made that change was considered my
 
04:26:19.250 --> 04:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
first term or my second and the it was
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
for regular farm animals particularly
 
04:26:27.170 --> 04:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
cows and pigs not necessarily for deer
 
04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh HHS is not involved in cow with cows
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
and pigs very much so I don't know where
 
04:26:37.090 --> 04:26:37.100 align:start position:0%
this requirement the deer need to be
 
04:26:41.330 --> 04:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
USDA slaughtered came from but
 
04:26:41.340 --> 04:26:43.370 align:start position:0%
USDA slaughtered came from but
um

04:26:43.370 --> 04:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:46.010 --> 04:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification I I just
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
happen to remember that that bill came
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
through the legislature
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
there was a bill two years ago that
 
04:26:57.349 --> 04:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
um Exempted bison
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
from some of the procedures to do that
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
at that time there was also elk and red
 
04:27:05.649 --> 04:27:05.659 align:start position:0%
deer in the bill but that was struck out
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
the USDA meet was it's part of the rules
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
that go with my
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
license from HHS to uh
 
04:27:19.130 --> 04:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
on frozen meat that it has to be
 
04:27:19.140 --> 04:27:21.649 align:start position:0%
on frozen meat that it has to be
inspected

04:27:21.649 --> 04:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative goal
 
04:27:26.510 --> 04:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
I just had a question I raise Angora
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
rabbits and I know there are European
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
based rabbit and and don't
 
04:27:31.680 --> 04:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
based rabbit and and don't
um

04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
is it pertaining to the bill itself
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
because we're not agriculture in terms
 
04:27:40.920 --> 04:27:42.110 align:start position:0%
because we're not agriculture in terms
of

04:27:42.110 --> 04:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the room making and why
 
04:27:47.210 --> 04:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
um why he's falling under
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
04:27:49.199 --> 04:27:50.510 align:start position:0%
fishing game
is

04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:27:50.520 --> 04:27:51.649 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:27:51.649 --> 04:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:53.809 --> 04:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
oh our diseases spread between the
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
red-tailed deer and the and the wild
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
deer here natives I'm sorry diseases
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
once again if I if I can start yeah I
 
04:28:04.010 --> 04:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
don't think it really pertains to the
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:15.050 --> 04:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that I can read the next
 
04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
name I'll do my best for New Hampshire
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
dot Kathleen McCall hey
 
04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
it kind of gets cut off Hampton
 
04:28:24.120 --> 04:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
it kind of gets cut off Hampton
okay

04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:29.570 --> 04:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
Captain Mulcahy hampson I am the senior
 
04:28:35.090 --> 04:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
hearings examiner for nhdot and the
 
04:28:39.050 --> 04:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:39.060 --> 04:28:41.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:28:41.389 --> 04:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:45.410 --> 04:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
um it's my privilege to appear before
 
04:28:47.330 --> 04:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
you on behalf of the Department of
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
Transportation I'm here this afternoon
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
to oppose provisions of HB 274
 
04:28:56.330 --> 04:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
um specifically the provisions that
 
04:28:58.990 --> 04:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
repeal exemptions from rule making
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
specific to dot on page 14 line 31 we're
 
04:29:07.490 --> 04:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
currently exempt from rule making for
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
Speed establishing speed zones and that
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
exemption would be repealed line 33
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
would repeal our exemption from
 
04:29:20.450 --> 04:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
rulemaking for excavation permits line
 
04:29:22.849 --> 04:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
34 would repeal our exemption from
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
rulemaking for driveway permits and then
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
on the top of page five it repeals
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
um an exemption I don't know that we
 
04:29:32.330 --> 04:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
have for
 
04:29:34.729 --> 04:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
um determining toll rates as far as I
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
know the total rate of tolls on the
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
turnpike system are determined by
 
04:29:41.689 --> 04:29:41.699 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and it would also
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
on line 13 remove an exemption from
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking for Easy Pass interagency
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
agreements I just want to go through
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
those um quickly one by one the driveway
 
04:29:53.520 --> 04:29:54.130 align:start position:0%
those um quickly one by one the driveway
um

04:29:54.130 --> 04:29:54.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
permitting has been Exempted from
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
rulemaking since 1999 or 2000 there's
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
been a bill every two years for the past
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
several sessions to require that the
 
04:30:08.090 --> 04:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
driveway permits be under rulemaking and
 
04:30:10.490 --> 04:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's been killed by the legislature
 
04:30:12.130 --> 04:30:12.140 align:start position:0%
each time
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
the driveway permitting is based on very
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
specific engineering standards it really
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't lend itself to rule making and I
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
can tell you if someone has denied a
 
04:30:27.050 --> 04:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
driveway permit in New Hampshire and
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
they want to appeal that it would be
 
04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
appealed to me as the senior hearings
 
04:30:33.050 --> 04:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
examiner for the department and I
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
haven't had anyone appeal a driveway
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
Denial in the last at least 18 months
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
um before that time
 
04:30:44.530 --> 04:30:44.540 align:start position:0%
um not very often did I handle an appeal
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of speed zones establishing
 
04:30:49.729 --> 04:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
speed zones again
 
04:30:49.739 --> 04:30:50.330 align:start position:0%
speed zones again
um

04:30:50.330 --> 04:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:52.849 --> 04:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
speed zones are established by Statute
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
and then what discretion the
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner of dot has for that
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
um is based on engineering standards and
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
again does not lend itself to rule
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
making I do have a letter for the
 
04:31:09.649 --> 04:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
committee that was written by our
 
04:31:11.929 --> 04:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
administrator of the Bureau of turnpikes
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
Bill Lambert it states the Department's
 
04:31:18.410 --> 04:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
concerns more clearly and professionally
 
04:31:20.570 --> 04:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
than than I can explain to you so I'll
 
04:31:22.969 --> 04:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
just leave that for on regarding the
 
04:31:24.189 --> 04:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
speed zones
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of excavation permits that
 
04:31:29.210 --> 04:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
would be permits for when someone wants
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
to dig within the state's right-of-ways
 
04:31:36.170 --> 04:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
again based on engineering standards it
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
involves federal regulations and doesn't
 
04:31:43.250 --> 04:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
lend itself to rulemaking in my 15 years
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
as a senior hearings examiner I've never
 
04:31:48.110 --> 04:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
had anyone file an appeal regarding
 
04:31:50.809 --> 04:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
excavation permits
 
04:31:54.590 --> 04:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly the exemption for
 
04:31:57.649 --> 04:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass interagency agreements
 
04:31:57.659 --> 04:31:58.370 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass interagency agreements
um

04:31:58.370 --> 04:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
dot is part of a Consortium of other
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
tolling States
 
04:32:06.889 --> 04:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
um in regard to electronic tolling
 
04:32:09.410 --> 04:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
um they come to agreements on what
 
04:32:11.090 --> 04:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
requirements should be for the
 
04:32:13.729 --> 04:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
electronic tolling transponders how to
 
04:32:15.530 --> 04:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
deal with certain issues they work on a
 
04:32:18.769 --> 04:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
lot of joint issues together I'm not I
 
04:32:20.450 --> 04:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
don't have a number on the number of
 
04:32:22.490 --> 04:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
States involved but it's more than 10
 
04:32:24.050 --> 04:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
states that are involved in the
 
04:32:27.170 --> 04:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
interagency Easy Pass agreement and I'm
 
04:32:30.530 --> 04:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how rulemaking would fit
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the actions that dot takes in
 
04:32:35.870 --> 04:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
concert with so many other states I
 
04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
again don't think it lends itself to um
 
04:32:41.450 --> 04:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
rule making so I understand this is
 
04:32:43.729 --> 04:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
going to a subcommittee and I would just
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight the Department's
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
concerns with repealing these exemptions
 
04:32:52.849 --> 04:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
04:32:55.729 --> 04:32:55.739 align:start position:0%
you any questions yes representative
 
04:32:57.769 --> 04:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
s be available to join us in our
 
04:33:08.631 --> 04:33:08.641 align:start position:0%
deliberations absolutely thank you
 
04:33:10.849 --> 04:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas thank you and
 
04:33:13.369 --> 04:33:13.379 align:start position:0%
again if you have or can create just a
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
list of the sections you have an issue
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
with and some brief comment as to what
 
04:33:19.369 --> 04:33:19.379 align:start position:0%
it is since trying to remember these all
 
04:33:21.170 --> 04:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
of these uh for the subcommittee is
 
04:33:22.730 --> 04:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult I appreciate that
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%

04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Marty Mobley I'm the
 
04:33:46.250 --> 04:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
legal coordinator at Fish and Game and I
 
04:33:48.170 --> 04:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
had not intended to speak today we did
 
04:33:50.090 --> 04:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
so much submit uh written testimony
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
electronically in opposition to the bill
 
04:33:54.410 --> 04:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to clarify and
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
reassure the committee that we do notice
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
and post our rules online as per RSA
 
04:34:06.769 --> 04:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
541a requires us to do we did make
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
changes to our FIS 800 rules as mandated
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
by HB 1299 that was passed last year we
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
made changes
 
04:34:17.810 --> 04:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
to those two existing roles as well as
 
04:34:21.529 --> 04:34:21.539 align:start position:0%
adopted new rules to allow for an appeal
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
for a permit denial to import possess
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
release wildlife and these were posted
 
04:34:30.289 --> 04:34:30.299 align:start position:0%
on our website they were noticed in the
 
04:34:34.369 --> 04:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
rule making registered we had a a public
 
04:34:37.490 --> 04:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
hearing and we were in front of Joe card
 
04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
the rules have been adopted they were
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
approved by Joe Carr and they have been
 
04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
adopted and the adopted rule is still on
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
our website so it is it is available for
 
04:34:49.490 --> 04:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
for perusal and we did follow the
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
process that is spelled out in the
 
04:34:53.570 --> 04:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
rulemaking manual for these rules
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:34:59.090 --> 04:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much is there
 
04:35:00.289 --> 04:35:00.299 align:start position:0%
any other member of the public that
 
04:35:12.170 --> 04:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.180 --> 04:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:35:13.510 --> 04:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:35:16.609 --> 04:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Daniel Cauley
 
04:35:18.890 --> 04:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
from the McGrath Law Firm
 
04:35:18.900 --> 04:35:19.730 align:start position:0%
from the McGrath Law Firm
um

04:35:19.730 --> 04:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
we have been representing uh small
 
04:35:24.170 --> 04:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
businesses and helping them grow in New
 
04:35:26.209 --> 04:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for quite some time now
 
04:35:29.330 --> 04:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh we're here to support this bill we
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
believe that it cuts through the red
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
tape we believe that it
 
04:35:34.080 --> 04:35:34.730 align:start position:0%
tape we believe that it
um

04:35:34.730 --> 04:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:34.740 --> 04:35:36.310 align:start position:0%
um
it

04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
simplifies the rule making process uh we
 
04:35:42.890 --> 04:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
believe it safeguards the policies that
 
04:35:44.689 --> 04:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
the legislature has already put in place
 
04:35:49.609 --> 04:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
I believe the goal of this bill it stops
 
04:35:52.910 --> 04:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
rules from distorting policy and that's
 
04:35:54.470 --> 04:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
very important when we're representing
 
04:35:55.970 --> 04:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
clients in the court because we're
 
04:35:57.650 --> 04:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
dealing with the rules and we're dealing
 
04:35:59.810 --> 04:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
with the statutes and somehow we have to
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
explain it to a judge
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
it stops making policy through the rules
 
04:36:08.689 --> 04:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
um legislature has already made policy
 
04:36:12.769 --> 04:36:12.779 align:start position:0%
it offers a constitutional approach to
 
04:36:16.250 --> 04:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
approve or disapprove a rule that is in
 
04:36:16.260 --> 04:36:17.289 align:start position:0%
approve or disapprove a rule that is in
place

04:36:17.289 --> 04:36:17.299 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:36:21.051 --> 04:36:21.061 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example after covert
 
04:36:23.090 --> 04:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
small business clients have been coming
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
up to us
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
they've been practicing they've been
 
04:36:29.090 --> 04:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
for quite some time
 
04:36:34.131 --> 04:36:34.141 align:start position:0%
well known in their industry for where
 
04:36:35.349 --> 04:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
they practice
 
04:36:38.269 --> 04:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
but they're confused because all of a
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
sudden there's a new enforcement action
 
04:36:43.449 --> 04:36:43.459 align:start position:0%
either for because of new rules being
 
04:36:47.929 --> 04:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
added or old rules being implemented for
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
the first time and enforcement action is
 
04:36:53.929 --> 04:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
pretty scary because recently you know
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking not only I've seen not
 
04:36:59.330 --> 04:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
only dealing with the agency fines
 
04:37:02.209 --> 04:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with criminal court fines
 
04:37:04.131 --> 04:37:04.141 align:start position:0%
and you're dealing well now with the
 
04:37:06.410 --> 04:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
cost of uh they want the cost of their
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
investigation to be paid so
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
my clients are trying to be compliant
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
but they're confused between the rules
 
04:37:17.209 --> 04:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
and the confuse between what the law
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
says and it's scaring away small
 
04:37:22.609 --> 04:37:22.619 align:start position:0%
business owners in the state
 
04:37:22.619 --> 04:37:23.330 align:start position:0%
business owners in the state
um

04:37:23.330 --> 04:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
I'll just give you a specific example
 
04:37:28.849 --> 04:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
right now I'm representing I don't want
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
to go in too much detail because I'll be
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the in front of the Supreme Court
 
04:37:33.289 --> 04:37:33.299 align:start position:0%
next month
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm representing a probably one of
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
the oldest Educators in testing
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:37:43.609 --> 04:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
will particular license
 
04:37:46.250 --> 04:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
very successful
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
um these devices he's a private third
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
party instructor
 
04:37:53.631 --> 04:37:53.641 align:start position:0%
um historically what would happen is
 
04:37:55.250 --> 04:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
they would go to these private third
 
04:37:58.369 --> 04:37:58.379 align:start position:0%
party instructors they would create the
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
education materials they would create
 
04:38:03.769 --> 04:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
the testing for and actually test them
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
and then they would go and get their
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
license there's never been a complaint
 
04:38:10.849 --> 04:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
about this now all of a sudden and his
 
04:38:13.490 --> 04:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
materials by the way are proprietary he
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to release them they've
 
04:38:17.570 --> 04:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
remain safe on his facility I don't know
 
04:38:19.730 --> 04:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
more than 15 years at this point there's
 
04:38:22.730 --> 04:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
no rule change new rule change is that
 
04:38:25.609 --> 04:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
now the state of New Hampshire wants him
 
04:38:30.289 --> 04:38:30.299 align:start position:0%
to produce all of his materials and so
 
04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
they can keep it on the lock and key in
 
04:38:35.449 --> 04:38:35.459 align:start position:0%
their facility I don't know why that is
 
04:38:37.010 --> 04:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
being even asked because there's never
 
04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
been a security issue in the in the
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
there is it's not mandated by policy or
 
04:38:44.570 --> 04:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
statute so that's part of the argument
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to be having and I think we
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
should keep in mind that boards and I've
 
04:38:51.170 --> 04:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
sat on a healthcare board before I've
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
helped with the rule making I've never
 
04:38:56.349 --> 04:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
got to the gel call level but
 
04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
members change
 
04:39:03.769 --> 04:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
on boards on committees and my client is
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned because sometimes
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
his competitors are sitting on on that
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
board and they will interpret the law
 
04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
the way they want to interpret the law
 
04:39:16.490 --> 04:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
not the way the law is read and that and
 
04:39:19.730 --> 04:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
they try to you know make roles to
 
04:39:22.970 --> 04:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
around what what that means so the
 
04:39:26.209 --> 04:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
policy is not broken it's uh the rules
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
should not be making policy right and we
 
04:39:32.209 --> 04:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
hear the term live free and die to me
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
what that means let's keep it simple and
 
04:39:36.529 --> 04:39:36.539 align:start position:0%
let's don't complicate things that's
 
04:39:38.208 --> 04:39:38.218 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire is all about and
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm supporting this bill
 
04:39:39.480 --> 04:39:40.730 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm supporting this bill
today

few times to answer questions regarding
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
rules last year I spoke briefly on a
 
04:40:39.650 --> 04:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
committee of conference tab but this is
 
04:40:41.930 --> 04:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
the first time I've ever appeared before
 
04:40:45.770 --> 04:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
a regular policy committee to testify I
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
don't like to do that I'm a legislative
 
04:40:49.970 --> 04:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
employee but I'm not testifying either
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
on behalf or opposed to the bill I'm
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
just raising some concerns that we have
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
seen when we looked at it I'm concerned
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
that implementation of the bill would be
 
04:41:03.530 --> 04:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
very problematic as it's worded now
 
04:41:03.540 --> 04:41:05.448 align:start position:0%
very problematic as it's worded now
hello

04:41:05.448 --> 04:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
hello
 
04:41:07.390 --> 04:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
I am just going to
 
04:41:10.368 --> 04:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
very generally discuss a few of the
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
issues if the committee would like I can
 
04:41:15.050 --> 04:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
do a more detailed memo going over the
 
04:41:17.690 --> 04:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
problems I've gone through it several
 
04:41:21.948 --> 04:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
times and I think I wrote to about 80 or
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
90 questions and comments on the bill
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
something in writing would be helpful I
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
think okay
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
the first significant concern is the
 
04:41:33.650 --> 04:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
fact the bill would allow either gel car
 
04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
or a policy committee to issue a denial
 
04:41:40.128 --> 04:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
of the rule basically kill the rule
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
right there
 
04:41:45.890 --> 04:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
gel car was formed in 1983 the
 
04:41:47.810 --> 04:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures Act was passed
 
04:41:47.820 --> 04:41:48.550 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures Act was passed
in

04:41:48.550 --> 04:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
1973. in 1981 there was a bill before
 
04:41:55.310 --> 04:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate there was going to allow
 
04:41:59.570 --> 04:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
committees to veto rules uh I apparently
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
there was concern about the
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of that so the general
 
04:42:06.770 --> 04:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
court sent questions to the Supreme
 
04:42:09.410 --> 04:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
Court and the Supreme Court issued an
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
opinion it was called
 
04:42:16.128 --> 04:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
opinion of the Justice justices 121 New
 
04:42:19.610 --> 04:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 552 that was issued in 1981
 
04:42:23.690 --> 04:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they said essentially that a veto by
 
04:42:25.150 --> 04:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
a single committee
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
yes the rule is because the legislature
 
04:42:33.410 --> 04:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
has given authority to the agencies they
 
04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
have delegated rulemaking authority uh
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
delegated legislation Authority
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority uh that can't be
 
04:42:43.010 --> 04:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
taken away except by the entire
 
04:42:45.890 --> 04:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
legislature so if there was a rule
 
04:42:48.288 --> 04:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
forward gel Carr said no this is bad
 
04:42:50.590 --> 04:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to deny it
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
that would violate the constitution
 
04:42:57.050 --> 04:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
also under the bill there is a provision
 
04:42:57.060 --> 04:42:58.128 align:start position:0%
also under the bill there is a provision
where

04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:43:01.310 --> 04:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
before jailcar had up to 60 days to
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
review a final proposal after it was
 
04:43:03.780 --> 04:43:05.170 align:start position:0%
review a final proposal after it was
filed

04:43:05.170 --> 04:43:05.180 align:start position:0%
filed
 
04:43:07.730 --> 04:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
if they did not do it within that time
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
frame the rule was automatically
 
04:43:12.430 --> 04:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
approved and the agency could adopt it
 
04:43:15.770 --> 04:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
that takes out the bill takes out the 45
 
04:43:18.530 --> 04:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
the 60-day limit
 
04:43:18.540 --> 04:43:19.128 align:start position:0%
the 60-day limit
um

04:43:19.128 --> 04:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:19.138 --> 04:43:20.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:23.330 --> 04:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
gel car could hold on to a rule forever
 
04:43:26.690 --> 04:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
that would end up at some point being a
 
04:43:30.128 --> 04:43:30.138 align:start position:0%
veto likewise with joint resolutions
 
04:43:32.330 --> 04:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
joint resolution's been around a long
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
time about 20 years ago staff expressed
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
a concern because there were times when
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
jelcar voted to sponsor a joint
 
04:43:43.490 --> 04:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
resolution but the joint resolution was
 
04:43:47.090 --> 04:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
never sent to the legislature or the
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
legislature received one and then didn't
 
04:43:51.530 --> 04:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
act on it well in the meantime the rule
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
cannot be adopted because of the joint
 
04:43:53.760 --> 04:43:54.910 align:start position:0%
cannot be adopted because of the joint
resolution

04:43:54.910 --> 04:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:43:58.010 --> 04:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
so it was just sitting there in limbo at
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
some point it becomes uh in fact a veto
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the rule
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
so that is quite problematic and the
 
04:44:08.570 --> 04:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases directly on this
 
04:44:08.580 --> 04:44:10.550 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases directly on this
point

04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:44:10.560 --> 04:44:11.390 align:start position:0%
point
um

04:44:11.390 --> 04:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:13.610 --> 04:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
there are a number of major Clarity
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
issues there are Provisions that
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's new language that conflicts with
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
other new language or conflicts with
 
04:44:25.730 --> 04:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
existing language in 541a
 
04:44:28.610 --> 04:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of new terms that
 
04:44:31.970 --> 04:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
are in the bill for example substantial
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
operational impact and excessive burdens
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who's going to decide what
 
04:44:41.150 --> 04:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
those means is it going to vary by a
 
04:44:42.650 --> 04:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
committee to committee when they look at
 
04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.850 --> 04:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
um a major issue is that in a couple of
 
04:44:53.208 --> 04:44:53.218 align:start position:0%
places in the rules in the bill it talks
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
about as the bill this morning did
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
when rules are adopted relating to brand
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
new legislation
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that's fine but there are many more
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
places in the bill that it doesn't talk
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
about new legislation that simply talks
 
04:45:12.170 --> 04:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
about statutes or legislation that means
 
04:45:14.570 --> 04:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
I think as was mentioned before you
 
04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
could have a rule go to a standing
 
04:45:19.490 --> 04:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
committee in the underlying legislation
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
was passed 30 years ago
 
04:45:24.288 --> 04:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
is the that policy committee going to be
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
able to determine what legislative
 
04:45:33.770 --> 04:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
there is also the concern about action
 
04:45:39.730 --> 04:45:39.740 align:start position:0%
by policy committees when the session is
 
04:45:42.170 --> 04:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
not in place
 
04:45:44.448 --> 04:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
um there's no mention in the in the bill
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:48.360 --> 04:45:54.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:45:54.410 --> 04:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
there are several requirements that call
 
04:46:00.050 --> 04:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
about say something to the effect of do
 
04:46:02.810 --> 04:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
not exceed the policy or intent but that
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
language varies in about four or five
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
different places
 
04:46:08.930 --> 04:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's small wording changes but it has a
 
04:46:10.970 --> 04:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
dramatic effect
 
04:46:10.980 --> 04:46:13.390 align:start position:0%
dramatic effect
um

04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
there is also a change right now uh gel
 
04:46:17.400 --> 04:46:19.310 align:start position:0%
there is also a change right now uh gel
car

04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
car
 
04:46:22.128 --> 04:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
although the statute says may gel car
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
always looks at proposals by agencies if
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
there is a new rule proposed then gel
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
car reviews everyone It also says they
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
may look at already adopted rules if
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
they have a concern the bill would
 
04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
change it to Shell for both so in
 
04:46:40.730 --> 04:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
essence that would require a gel car to
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
go back and look at every single rule
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
that's been adopted which is
 
04:46:44.340 --> 04:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
that's been adopted which is
impossibility

04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
um there are a few other concerns
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
right now gel carb May object when there
 
04:46:57.470 --> 04:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
is one of the four bases for objection
 
04:46:59.570 --> 04:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
um I think the reason that is in the
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
statute is because some issues become
 
04:47:03.890 --> 04:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
before gel car that may be warrant a
 
04:47:05.930 --> 04:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection but not a final
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
objection or
 
04:47:10.490 --> 04:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
they receive comments from staff as I
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning we're obliged to
 
04:47:14.930 --> 04:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
notify by Statute we're obliged to
 
04:47:18.890 --> 04:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
notify gel car of any potential basis
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
for objection I mean after 30 years here
 
04:47:24.530 --> 04:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
I know that there are some rules that
 
04:47:26.208 --> 04:47:26.218 align:start position:0%
they're not going to object to even
 
04:47:27.890 --> 04:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
though it's a potential basis for
 
04:47:27.900 --> 04:47:29.350 align:start position:0%
though it's a potential basis for
objection

04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
objection
 
04:47:32.448 --> 04:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
that will be taken away so regardless of
 
04:47:34.250 --> 04:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
how minor the issue
 
04:47:36.170 --> 04:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
the committee will be forced to object
 
04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
to the rule
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
04:47:42.890 --> 04:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
20 years ago the conditional approval
 
04:47:46.090 --> 04:47:46.100 align:start position:0%
system was created because before that
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
jailcar could only object there could be
 
04:47:50.930 --> 04:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
a Minor error in the rule everybody
 
04:47:52.850 --> 04:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
realized that it could be easily fixed
 
04:47:55.010 --> 04:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
including the agency the agency wants to
 
04:47:57.050 --> 04:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
fix it but the only option the committee
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
had was to enter preliminary objection
 
04:48:01.970 --> 04:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
the agency had to go back do a another
 
04:48:04.550 --> 04:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
full rule bring it back to the committee
 
04:48:06.650 --> 04:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
they might have to wait two or three
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
months before the committee takes it up
 
04:48:10.128 --> 04:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
because the committee's final proposals
 
04:48:12.170 --> 04:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
take priority so the conditional
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
approval system was created where they
 
04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
make the jail car says make this change
 
04:48:19.610 --> 04:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
and they make that change and they don't
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
have to go back before jail car this
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
would essentially
 
04:48:27.770 --> 04:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
get rid of that
 
04:48:27.780 --> 04:48:28.788 align:start position:0%
get rid of that
um

04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:31.250 --> 04:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
the bill also requires all received
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
rules receiving a preliminary objection
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
to be sent to the policy committee
 
04:48:37.368 --> 04:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the basis relates
 
04:48:40.208 --> 04:48:40.218 align:start position:0%
to legislative intent I mean legislative
 
04:48:43.128 --> 04:48:43.138 align:start position:0%
Joe Carter kind of
 
04:48:45.230 --> 04:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
um do it based on Authority in other
 
04:48:47.570 --> 04:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
words is the rulemaking Authority for
 
04:48:49.850 --> 04:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
the agency sufficient to cover the rule
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
they do legislative intent they do
 
04:48:55.550 --> 04:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statement is the fiscal
 
04:48:58.128 --> 04:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
impact statement inadequate so all new
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
rules have to get a fiscal impact
 
04:49:01.610 --> 04:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
statement from the LBA
 
04:49:04.368 --> 04:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
and the final one is public interest and
 
04:49:06.410 --> 04:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
you say oh wait a minute that makes gel
 
04:49:07.788 --> 04:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
car a policy committee they're looking
 
04:49:10.250 --> 04:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
at public interest well in the gel Car
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
Zone rules those are very very narrowly
 
04:49:15.770 --> 04:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
defined it's Clarity issues is the rule
 
04:49:18.410 --> 04:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
clear and understandable can it be
 
04:49:20.110 --> 04:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
uniformly applied
 
04:49:25.368 --> 04:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
was public testimony uh fairly heard
 
04:49:25.378 --> 04:49:26.150 align:start position:0%
was public testimony uh fairly heard
um

04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
so there was that question uh there will
 
04:49:31.970 --> 04:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
also be any significant increase in
 
04:49:35.770 --> 04:49:35.780 align:start position:0%
rulemaking as was testified to by dot
 
04:49:39.890 --> 04:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
there are 5.821 contains a long list of
 
04:49:42.770 --> 04:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
exemptions uh from the rulemaking or
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
from part of the rulemaking process
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
these are by and large because it was
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
trying to fit a square peg into a round
 
04:49:53.448 --> 04:49:53.458 align:start position:0%
hole the agency had to make changes in
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
response to federal law or state law far
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
more quickly than the regular rule
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
making process would allow so they
 
04:50:01.788 --> 04:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
received an exemption or a partial
 
04:50:05.930 --> 04:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
exemption uh all those agencies Housing
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority Etc will now have to
 
04:50:11.390 --> 04:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
do a complete set of rules
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
also there is a requirement
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the rule in the bill that if one
 
04:50:19.610 --> 04:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
piece of public testimony is received by
 
04:50:20.930 --> 04:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
an agency
 
04:50:23.208 --> 04:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
potentially even in support of the rule
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
then they have to the agency has to
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
create a draft final proposal and put
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
that out there for testimony and
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
delaying the process when there may have
 
04:50:36.350 --> 04:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
no been no practical need for that but
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
the statute is written is rigid about
 
04:50:39.600 --> 04:50:41.390 align:start position:0%
the statute is written is rigid about
that

04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:43.970 --> 04:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
um this will I think expand the
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
rulemaking time frames right now on
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
average it takes about five months for
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
an agency to go through the rulemaking
 
04:50:53.150 --> 04:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
process uh I think the other steps are
 
04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to increase that I mean some
 
04:50:57.288 --> 04:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
people think five months is too long but
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
they are doing lawmaking and as you know
 
04:51:02.570 --> 04:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
bills don't go through very quickly less
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
than five months so there's no reason
 
04:51:05.690 --> 04:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
the rule should either
 
04:51:05.700 --> 04:51:10.570 align:start position:0%
the rule should either
uh

04:51:10.570 --> 04:51:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.610 --> 04:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
also the bill will require
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
in practice it would require substantial
 
04:51:20.208 --> 04:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
uh redraft of the rulemaking manual that
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
is a manual that's put out it's approved
 
04:51:24.850 --> 04:51:24.860 align:start position:0%
by the director of legislative Services
 
04:51:27.770 --> 04:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
when amended it's approved by gel car
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it's about that thick and it
 
04:51:31.610 --> 04:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
contains all the requirements that
 
04:51:33.890 --> 04:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
agencies have to follow in drafting
 
04:51:36.050 --> 04:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
rules and it contains the entire
 
04:51:38.690 --> 04:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
procedure it fleshes out the statute
 
04:51:42.650 --> 04:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
541a that would require substantial work
 
04:51:44.690 --> 04:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
would take would take months I've
 
04:51:46.448 --> 04:51:46.458 align:start position:0%
noticed that the bill would take effect
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
two two months after passage 60 days
 
04:51:50.638 --> 04:51:53.750 align:start position:0%
two two months after passage 60 days
foreign

04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:56.208 --> 04:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
regarding some of the other issues that
 
04:51:58.490 --> 04:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
have been raised by the testimony there
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
was questions about the
 
04:52:01.920 --> 04:52:03.230 align:start position:0%
was questions about the
clarity

04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
the public policy excuse me
 
04:52:09.010 --> 04:52:09.020 align:start position:0%
I told you about recent verses oh law
 
04:52:13.490 --> 04:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
but the participation by the public I
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
think Representative Sam Barnes bill
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
take steps to it increasing public
 
04:52:22.010 --> 04:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
participation part of the problem that
 
04:52:24.410 --> 04:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
I've seen in the past is the public is
 
04:52:26.330 --> 04:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
generally not aware of when a rule
 
04:52:29.170 --> 04:52:29.180 align:start position:0%
affecting them is being proposed
 
04:52:29.180 --> 04:52:31.150 align:start position:0%
affecting them is being proposed
currently

04:52:31.150 --> 04:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
541a requires the agencies to post a
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
notice of the rulemaking in the
 
04:52:39.230 --> 04:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking register which is published
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
weekly by our office most agencies
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
especially the larger ones post a copy
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
of The Proposal on their website I think
 
04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
representative sanborn's bill will
 
04:52:52.730 --> 04:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
require that it be posted on the website
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh jailcar is authorized under the
 
04:52:57.650 --> 04:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
statute to make
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
other requirements as far as public
 
04:53:01.970 --> 04:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
participation I I've certainly seen in
 
04:53:05.090 --> 04:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
the past where a rule comes before jail
 
04:53:07.730 --> 04:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
car as a final proposal people show up
 
04:53:10.128 --> 04:53:10.138 align:start position:0%
to testify and gel car often asks well
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
did you testify at the hearing before
 
04:53:13.970 --> 04:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
the agency and they said no I just
 
04:53:15.948 --> 04:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
learned about it yesterday
 
04:53:15.958 --> 04:53:16.670 align:start position:0%
learned about it yesterday
um

04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:19.010 --> 04:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
I can understand that maybe there needs
 
04:53:21.410 --> 04:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
to be further clarification out there
 
04:53:24.410 --> 04:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
but people also have a responsibility to
 
04:53:27.530 --> 04:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
know the know the law you can't say to
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
the police officer I didn't know what
 
04:53:31.610 --> 04:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
speed limit was here you're obliged to
 
04:53:33.070 --> 04:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:53:37.550 --> 04:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
certainly in under existing law if you
 
04:53:40.128 --> 04:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
are say a licensee or regulated by some
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
agency you can ask them whenever a rule
 
04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
comes through that would affect that
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
person that they receive specific notice
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
from the agency when that rule comes
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
forward I think something like that
 
04:53:57.170 --> 04:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
certainly can be helpful but maybe needs
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
to be more widely publicized
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know other than that I would take
 
04:54:01.440 --> 04:54:03.350 align:start position:0%
you know other than that I would take
questions

04:54:03.350 --> 04:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:54:04.730 --> 04:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lucas
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
um you referenced a couple times a
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision around the um
 
04:54:14.810 --> 04:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
what a committee can and can't do could
 
04:54:16.850 --> 04:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
you either uh provide that to the
 
04:54:18.650 --> 04:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee or a pointer to it we could
 
04:54:21.890 --> 04:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
find it yes uh I can cite it and then I
 
04:54:26.570 --> 04:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
can obtain copies it's uh 121
 
04:54:28.250 --> 04:54:28.260 align:start position:0%

04:54:28.260 --> 04:54:30.110 align:start position:0%

04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
552.
 
04:54:32.690 --> 04:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
and it was from 1981 and it's called
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
opinion of the justices
 
04:54:37.610 --> 04:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:37.620 --> 04:54:39.708 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:54:41.448 --> 04:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:41.458 --> 04:54:42.230 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:45.050 --> 04:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
I did have a question
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
um on page four of the bill uh down the
 
04:54:54.288 --> 04:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
section beginning line 28 about sending
 
04:54:56.570 --> 04:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
notice to licensees
 
04:55:01.070 --> 04:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I have concerns that this is
 
04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
expanding the notices that would have to
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
go out to me considerably by U.S mail
 
04:55:11.330 --> 04:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
have you looked at that section that it
 
04:55:14.690 --> 04:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the addition of
 
04:55:19.810 --> 04:55:19.820 align:start position:0%
operational or other regulatory licenses
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
expands the number of notices that would
 
04:55:24.010 --> 04:55:24.020 align:start position:0%
have to be sent out
 
04:55:27.410 --> 04:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
remarkably do you have do you have any
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
idea how you would even approach that
 
04:55:30.120 --> 04:55:30.708 align:start position:0%
idea how you would even approach that
um

04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:33.530 --> 04:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
it does expand it
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's an open question as to whether that
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
would require a mail a copy to be mailed
 
04:55:39.770 --> 04:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
to the person
 
04:55:42.890 --> 04:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
um in the past this provision used to
 
04:55:45.948 --> 04:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
say Michelle for any occupational
 
04:55:45.958 --> 04:55:47.390 align:start position:0%
say Michelle for any occupational
licensee

04:55:47.390 --> 04:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
they had to receive direct contact this
 
04:55:53.090 --> 04:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
was before email so they had to send a
 
04:55:54.770 --> 04:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
copy of the notice they didn't send a
 
04:55:58.010 --> 04:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
copy of the rule but now the notice and
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
the rule is generally on online and it
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
can certainly be emailed to all those
 
04:56:05.690 --> 04:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
regulated to the extent the while the
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
agency must have the addresses and
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
probably emails of all the people they
 
04:56:09.120 --> 04:56:10.310 align:start position:0%
probably emails of all the people they
regulate

04:56:10.310 --> 04:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm also concerned uh Mr and Herron
 
04:56:19.850 --> 04:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
testified that um
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
prior to the regulation Law whatever
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
created the need for him to have a
 
04:56:28.850 --> 04:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
license he didn't know how they would
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
even notify him about a potential need
 
04:56:34.690 --> 04:56:34.700 align:start position:0%
to have a license
 
04:56:38.690 --> 04:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that how a gel car
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
even be able to find folks that may be
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
affected going forward I don't know how
 
04:56:45.650 --> 04:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
gel car would but the agency involved
 
04:56:49.010 --> 04:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
the agencies that regulate him it could
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
be more of a requirement like this does
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
put on the agency to notify people that
 
04:56:56.570 --> 04:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
are regulated also people regulated can
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
look at the agent's website or request
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
us under current law that they be
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
notified when there is a rule that would
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
affect them
 
04:57:04.680 --> 04:57:06.530 align:start position:0%
affect them
foreign

04:57:06.530 --> 04:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:57:08.390 --> 04:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard
 
04:57:10.128 --> 04:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
thank you John
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
the idea how many new rules are created
 
04:57:13.730 --> 04:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
each year
 
04:57:13.740 --> 04:57:14.510 align:start position:0%
each year
um

04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
there for 2022 we had 244 new proposals
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
that means initial proposals all those
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
rules then go to final proposals
 
04:57:28.128 --> 04:57:28.138 align:start position:0%
um a third or more end up getting
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
conditional approvals so there's
 
04:57:32.810 --> 04:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
numerous iterations 244 was the most
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
we've had in several years it seemed
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
like during covet we were down to around
 
04:57:41.448 --> 04:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
150 but it has gone up we have had more
 
04:57:42.410 --> 04:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
than that
 
04:57:45.530 --> 04:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
most of those are not enacting new
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
legislation there may be rules because
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
rules most rules are only good for 10
 
04:57:53.690 --> 04:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
years so when the time comes up they
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
either need to re-adopt them re-adopt
 
04:57:58.010 --> 04:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
them with Amendment or if they no longer
 
04:58:01.010 --> 04:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
needed to repeal them so a lot of the
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
rules come through that way other times
 
04:58:05.570 --> 04:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
legislature makes a minor amendment to a
 
04:58:08.330 --> 04:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
statute that's going to necessitate a
 
04:58:12.170 --> 04:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:13.610 --> 04:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:58:15.770 --> 04:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm just that's actually a much lower
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
number than I thought it would be but
 
04:58:18.410 --> 04:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned what you said earlier
 
04:58:18.420 --> 04:58:19.310 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned what you said earlier
about

04:58:19.310 --> 04:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:58:21.410 --> 04:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
ignorance of the law is no excuse and
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
that side of thing I just think of let's
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
say the IRS code at 60 something
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
thousand pages right no one knows the
 
04:58:30.288 --> 04:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
law right no one does so I just don't
 
04:58:32.930 --> 04:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
like putting the onus on taxpayers who
 
04:58:35.090 --> 04:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
are funding us for being here to then
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
burden them with more things in order
 
04:58:38.448 --> 04:58:38.458 align:start position:0%
for them to make a living it just seems
 
04:58:39.948 --> 04:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
like a very vicious cycle of just
 
04:58:41.208 --> 04:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
creating jobs for ourselves when they're
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
violating laws they don't even know
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
about yeah that's certainly a policy
 
04:58:46.250 --> 04:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
consideration when looking at the bill I
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
mean as I said there could be strength
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
and requirements for the agencies to
 
04:58:54.770 --> 04:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
notify to notify individuals that is in
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
part done by the bill
 
04:58:57.420 --> 04:58:58.430 align:start position:0%
part done by the bill
foreign

04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:59:01.550 --> 04:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative gold
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:05.638 --> 04:59:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:59:06.770 --> 04:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:09.670 --> 04:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
the question was asked to be regarding
 
04:59:12.890 --> 04:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
notification of licensees of rule
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
changes that you would have email
 
04:59:16.970 --> 04:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
addresses on the existing people when
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
rule changes might affect them is that
 
04:59:22.208 --> 04:59:22.218 align:start position:0%
correct at one time
 
04:59:25.730 --> 04:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
agencies were required by mail to notify
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
the people and for somebody like the
 
04:59:29.570 --> 04:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing that has 30 000
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
licensees that was a pretty substantial
 
04:59:35.470 --> 04:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
expense but now they can do it by email
 
04:59:38.330 --> 04:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
the HR people can see it on the agency's
 
04:59:40.490 --> 04:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
website one thing the bill does I think
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
I may have mentioned is requires all
 
04:59:45.110 --> 04:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
agencies to post the rules on their
 
04:59:45.120 --> 04:59:47.510 align:start position:0%
agencies to post the rules on their
websites

04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
websites
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
so are you talking about you have that
 
04:59:51.890 --> 04:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
information or the agency has that
 
04:59:54.650 --> 04:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
information the agency I assume when the
 
04:59:57.050 --> 04:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
person applies for whether it's a permit
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
or a license
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
would provide an email address and last
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
point now that I understand those things
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the case where you have someone who's
 
05:00:11.208 --> 05:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
being impacted by a new agency getting
 
05:00:13.368 --> 05:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
involved then you can expect that agency
 
05:00:16.730 --> 05:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
to have that contact information correct
 
05:00:16.740 --> 05:00:18.590 align:start position:0%
to have that contact information correct
um

05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:20.930 --> 05:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
I guess that depends I mean if you do a
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
new board that's going to regulate some
 
05:00:26.750 --> 05:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
sort of activity then they may know who
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
is currently practicing and might be
 
05:00:30.530 --> 05:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
able to reach out to them or there may
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
be an association already in existence
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
which the members would belong to but
 
05:00:37.010 --> 05:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
yes generally you're you're correct they
 
05:00:38.810 --> 05:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know who they are
 
05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
for example when Health and Human
 
05:00:42.530 --> 05:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
Services wants to get involved in
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
licensing dear meat but they don't
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
they've never been involved with deer
 
05:00:48.410 --> 05:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have any way to know them
 
05:00:48.420 --> 05:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have any way to know them
correct

05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:00:49.440 --> 05:00:51.170 align:start position:0%
correct
correct

05:00:51.170 --> 05:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:00:55.850 --> 05:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.208 --> 05:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
05:01:01.850 --> 05:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I'm assuming
 
05:01:10.490 --> 05:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:01:15.050 --> 05:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
committee I'm a co-sponsor of this
 
05:01:16.850 --> 05:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
legislation but
 
05:01:19.850 --> 05:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with everything in it but
 
05:01:21.708 --> 05:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
I believe that it raises a number of
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
issues that we should take seriously
 
05:01:28.610 --> 05:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
one concern that I have is that
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
in my mere 12 years on on jail car
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
is that it's very difficult to get other
 
05:01:38.930 --> 05:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
legislators concerned about what happens
 
05:01:40.368 --> 05:01:40.378 align:start position:0%
in rules
 
05:01:40.378 --> 05:01:41.930 align:start position:0%
in rules
they

05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:01:44.570 --> 05:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
they want to dump
 
05:01:44.580 --> 05:01:46.430 align:start position:0%
they want to dump
uh

05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:01:49.490 --> 05:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
what the limit should be for various
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
items in water on the agency they don't
 
05:01:55.490 --> 05:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
want to get involved in the details if
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
you tell somebody if you try to notify
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
people of a rule coming that you think
 
05:02:02.690 --> 05:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
is in there
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
their scope
 
05:02:07.128 --> 05:02:07.138 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon for them to say oh
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
well you know Des will take care of it
 
05:02:12.970 --> 05:02:12.980 align:start position:0%
or or whomever HHS will take care of it
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so this bill is partly to make it
 
05:02:20.330 --> 05:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
easier for those legislators who want to
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
get involved to do so
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
and also to shake up some of the people
 
05:02:28.010 --> 05:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
that don't seem to care and get them to
 
05:02:29.810 --> 05:02:29.820 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the rules
 
05:02:29.820 --> 05:02:31.368 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the rules
because

05:02:31.368 --> 05:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
the rules are much larger than the
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
statutes I mean we have one one little
 
05:02:40.730 --> 05:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
bookcase that's got all the laws and I
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
have no idea how many pages of rules we
 
05:02:44.750 --> 05:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
have but it's a lot more
 
05:02:47.448 --> 05:02:47.458 align:start position:0%
and most people don't pay attention to
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
it even if they're in the legislature
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
and we end up with cases where
 
05:02:55.610 --> 05:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
we hand over to the agency's broad
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority to say just make
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
the rules we don't want to know the
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
details just do it and that's our fault
 
05:03:05.448 --> 05:03:05.458 align:start position:0%
and I think one this is partly an
 
05:03:08.330 --> 05:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
attempt to shake up the legislature and
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
say pay attention you're handing over
 
05:03:14.810 --> 05:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
your responsibility of making laws to
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
these agencies and you're not keeping an
 
05:03:19.368 --> 05:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:21.948 --> 05:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
um so I'm that's why I supported the
 
05:03:23.208 --> 05:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
build so I think
 
05:03:25.610 --> 05:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
we all need to pay more attention to the
 
05:03:25.620 --> 05:03:26.810 align:start position:0%
we all need to pay more attention to the
rules

05:03:26.810 --> 05:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:03:30.770 --> 05:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
and I think that getting the input of
 
05:03:35.090 --> 05:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
people who know about the details of a
 
05:03:37.610 --> 05:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
of a business or
 
05:03:41.930 --> 05:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
whatever is very useful the attorneys at
 
05:03:43.730 --> 05:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
gel Carr are very knowledgeable about
 
05:03:46.250 --> 05:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
the law but they don't necessarily have
 
05:03:49.310 --> 05:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
the context of every rule that they're
 
05:03:51.230 --> 05:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
writing sometimes they're they're
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
reading sometimes they do sometimes they
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
don't and a lot of times if you don't
 
05:03:58.850 --> 05:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
have the context you can look at the
 
05:04:01.010 --> 05:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
role and say oh yeah that's fine
 
05:04:03.170 --> 05:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
I'm I've done that myself I looked at
 
05:04:04.730 --> 05:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
the role and then I said well yeah but
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
but I have a friend who who works in
 
05:04:09.530 --> 05:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
this and I send it to him and he says
 
05:04:11.810 --> 05:04:11.820 align:start position:0%
what are you doing it's ridiculous it's
 
05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to be incredibly expensive because
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
he knew the details of what it was going
 
05:04:18.530 --> 05:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
to do and I didn't
 
05:04:21.708 --> 05:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
and so that's one thing
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature has got a
 
05:04:27.170 --> 05:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
wide range of skills and knowledge
 
05:04:29.330 --> 05:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
because there's so many of us and we're
 
05:04:31.490 --> 05:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
not professional lawmakers we've that
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
we've done something else with our lives
 
05:04:37.128 --> 05:04:37.138 align:start position:0%
so we generally have the context for one
 
05:04:39.890 --> 05:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
or two or three or whatever
 
05:04:43.490 --> 05:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
but if you don't look at it we can't get
 
05:04:46.730 --> 05:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
the benefit of of that knowledge and I
 
05:04:48.050 --> 05:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
really think we ought to get more people
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
involved and if this bill can do it
 
05:04:50.878 --> 05:04:51.948 align:start position:0%
involved and if this bill can do it
wonderful

05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
05:04:51.958 --> 05:04:53.930 align:start position:0%
wonderful
uh

05:04:53.930 --> 05:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:55.810 --> 05:04:55.820 align:start position:0%
I've been trying
 
05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
I will try to answer questions but I
 
05:05:00.770 --> 05:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
don't really have the details
 
05:05:04.010 --> 05:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:06.650 --> 05:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Grady
 
05:05:09.530 --> 05:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so this goes back to the
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
question I think I had her I had spoken
 
05:05:14.810 --> 05:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
I had asked um commissioner Jasper
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
so one of the
 
05:05:20.330 --> 05:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
consequences of having a passing statute
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
or passing legislation or submitting a
 
05:05:24.170 --> 05:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
bill well you don't know the
 
05:05:27.288 --> 05:05:27.298 align:start position:0%
consequences the full consequences
 
05:05:29.270 --> 05:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
is there a way of
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
doing that before
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
we get to that jail card process because
 
05:05:37.250 --> 05:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
once the law is passed
 
05:05:40.368 --> 05:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
so how do you you know I enjoy I applaud
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but at the same time
 
05:05:43.970 --> 05:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how it is that
 
05:05:45.530 --> 05:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
we can incorporate that kind of thinking
 
05:05:49.128 --> 05:05:49.138 align:start position:0%
before we even we even passed the law
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes well that's what the public hearing
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
process is for and you know and we try
 
05:05:57.230 --> 05:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
to get as many people as care to show up
 
05:06:00.410 --> 05:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
you've noticed that rulemaking is not a
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
big draw for the common people
 
05:06:05.570 --> 05:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
um but we try
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
the people who are working in rule
 
05:06:07.798 --> 05:06:08.990 align:start position:0%
the people who are working in rule
making

05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:06:13.010 --> 05:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
are here to to to inform you but the
 
05:06:15.170 --> 05:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
people who will be affected by the rules
 
05:06:16.610 --> 05:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
are generally not
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult to figure out
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
who might be affected
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
by a new law
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.208 --> 05:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that you know when we were
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
doing driver's licensing until
 
05:06:33.708 --> 05:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
constituent told me that his Jeep wasn't
 
05:06:36.288 --> 05:06:36.298 align:start position:0%
considered an agricultural vehicle even
 
05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
though he was carrying fertilizer and uh
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:46.190 --> 05:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Garrett
 
05:06:48.530 --> 05:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman would you be in
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
support of some sort of sunset provision
 
05:06:52.250 --> 05:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
then on this to see if it works if it
 
05:06:53.448 --> 05:06:53.458 align:start position:0%
doesn't then we just kill it and let it
 
05:06:53.458 --> 05:06:54.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't then we just kill it and let it
die

05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
die
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a lot to this bill
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know 15 pages there's a lot of
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
pieces some of them are
 
05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
not workable some of them are
 
05:07:05.040 --> 05:07:06.368 align:start position:0%
not workable some of them are
um

05:07:06.368 --> 05:07:06.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by by their nature
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
but because they record they allow a
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee to act with the authority of
 
05:07:18.050 --> 05:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
the whole which is
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
not not allowed but there's a lot of
 
05:07:23.930 --> 05:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
good ideas and I hope that we will we'll
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at it I was thinking about
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
the notification
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
and I would have no problem with saying
 
05:07:33.170 --> 05:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
that you know when we Pat when the new
 
05:07:36.288 --> 05:07:36.298 align:start position:0%
new rules implementing a new law are
 
05:07:39.288 --> 05:07:39.298 align:start position:0%
being put out for public comment email
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
blasts the entire house and the entire
 
05:07:44.270 --> 05:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
Senate and say hey we're these are the
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
rules that Implement house bill 148. if
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
you care look at the rules
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
I mean we should be paying attention but
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.090 --> 05:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure represent not representative Mr
 
05:08:10.320 --> 05:08:14.448 align:start position:0%
sure represent not representative Mr
Aaron

05:08:14.448 --> 05:08:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
just the the most important thing I was
 
05:08:19.850 --> 05:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
I think it's important in this bill
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
that the notification goes out to not
 
05:08:28.490 --> 05:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
only individuals
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
but to organizations that support those
 
05:08:35.930 --> 05:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
individuals like if the rule about the
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
frozen meat had gone to Farm Bureau and
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
they were notified then those of us that
 
05:08:44.208 --> 05:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
it would have been affected would have
 
05:08:47.270 --> 05:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
been notified if it's a forestry thing
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
or a land use thing it could go to uh
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
the Timberland Owners Association if
 
05:08:56.270 --> 05:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's a restaurant food thing it could go
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
to the Restaurant Association so I think
 
05:08:58.200 --> 05:08:59.570 align:start position:0%
to the Restaurant Association so I think
those

05:08:59.570 --> 05:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
ought to be important people
 
05:09:04.250 --> 05:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
to be notified of these rule changes
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
that's what I had thank you for taking
 
05:09:10.128 --> 05:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
me back again absolutely thank you
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:21.770 --> 05:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
just one or two more things that I
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
didn't touch on before
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
as representative McGuire had talked
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
about uh Clarity of the underlying
 
05:09:31.010 --> 05:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
statute and the rule-making authority
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
she's right some there sometimes there
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
are what we call Barn Door rulemaking
 
05:09:37.128 --> 05:09:37.138 align:start position:0%
authorities say any provision to
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
implement this chapter or this
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision well that leaves it wide
 
05:09:42.770 --> 05:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
open for the agency to say what they
 
05:09:45.170 --> 05:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
think implements and it's very hard for
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
the legislature or for jail card to say
 
05:09:51.230 --> 05:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
no that doesn't implement it I also want
 
05:09:53.170 --> 05:09:53.180 align:start position:0%
to say it's very hard to determine
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent with rules anyways
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
because the statute might be fairly
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
broad but rulemaking Authority and then
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to interpret it
 
05:10:06.288 --> 05:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
for example legislature creates a new
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
type of license and gives the authority
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
to the agency to set up the application
 
05:10:10.798 --> 05:10:11.930 align:start position:0%
to the agency to set up the application
process

05:10:11.930 --> 05:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:10:14.090 --> 05:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
well they're going to lay out a bunch of
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
things so they're going to create a form
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to specify what has to be
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
on the form they're going to perhaps say
 
05:10:23.810 --> 05:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
what the fee is ETC
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
are those particular is any one of those
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
given items within the provisions of the
 
05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
bill it can be very subjective to say
 
05:10:33.298 --> 05:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
bill it can be very subjective to say
that

05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:45.530 --> 05:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
all right that being the case we're
 
05:10:47.208 --> 05:10:47.218 align:start position:0%
going to refer this to the subcommittee
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
on rules and representative it's coming
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
your way and I'm going to close the
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 274.
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe that does it for us for
