this time to present
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
the governor's student debt relief plan
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
this is something of course that was uh
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of history to it if you
 
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.310 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of history to it if you
will

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
something that was proposed during the
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
last budget cycle
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
and it was then ultimately didn't make
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
it into the final compromise budget but
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
there was additional action
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
that took place last year trying to
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
build towards a consensus
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
and what i would say and what you see in
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
this proposal here today
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
really is a continuing a continuance of
 
00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
really is a continuing a continuance of
that

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
compromise that was worked on last
 
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.390 align:start position:0%
compromise that was worked on last
session

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
and what we've done essentially is find
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
ways to
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
continue to invest these monies in new
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire students
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
and its workforce to make sure that
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're driving the best
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
outcomes for our state you notice
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
here in hb2 and it begins on page 68
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
for those of you that are following
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
along on the text
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
essentially as an opportunity to
 
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.270 align:start position:0%
essentially as an opportunity to
reallocate

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
reallocate
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
how these monies are distributed we've
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
put forward a plan where
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
20 percent will continue to go to direct
 
00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.909 align:start position:0%
20 percent will continue to go to direct
scholarships

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
the way it currently operates under
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
statute but then we took a hard look at
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
where the remaining 80 percent can best
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
be invested
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
and with that 20 percent would continue
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
to go to the unique endowment program
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the balance that remaining 60
 
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.990 align:start position:0%
and the balance that remaining 60
percent

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
as a historic investment in student debt
 
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.430 align:start position:0%
as a historic investment in student debt
relief

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
and workforce development
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
we see this as an opportunity to drive
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
students to stay in new hampshire to
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
work in new hampshire
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
especially in critical fields you notice
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
things that are called out specifically
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
nurses at state facilities or any
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
licensed medical professional
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to transformative things
 
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.749 align:start position:0%
in addition to transformative things
like

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
biotechnology opportunities to continue
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
to grow our state
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we have the workforce
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
to really drive
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
forward those key initiatives that new
 
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.390 align:start position:0%
forward those key initiatives that new
hampshire

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
is continuing to be a leader in
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
is continuing to be a leader in
nationwide

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
nationwide
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
again we see this as an opportunity
 
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.270 align:start position:0%
again we see this as an opportunity
where

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
our workforce especially what we've seen
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
with coven 19
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the challenges the pandemic we
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to identify some of these key
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
fields and use this as a program for
 
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
fields and use this as a program for
good

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
right to make sure that we are able to
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
be nimble and respond to some of those
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
challenges as they arise
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
and as people you know are coming out of
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and looking at where they
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
may want to live
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
we know that new hampshire has seen a
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
hot real estate market
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
and especially people that might want to
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
find themselves in a more rural
 
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.029 align:start position:0%
find themselves in a more rural
environment

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
give this extra incentive for recent
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
graduates to
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
come live and work in new hampshire and
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
that that's the high level overview if
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
again seeing this as an opportunity to
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
build on that success
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
um and i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
or you know if
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
james or monica want to you know touch
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
on some of those other aspects of why
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
we see this really as a tremendous
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
workforce driver
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and again just just celebrating the
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
success of the 529 plans
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing just to close uh
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
my section here is
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
none of this money is taxpayer dollars
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
right this all comes from assessment
 
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.749 align:start position:0%
right this all comes from assessment
revenue

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
from the 529 plan so finding a way to do
 
00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
from the 529 plan so finding a way to do
this

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
in a way that doesn't impact the general
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
fund is another key highlight of this uh
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
this real innovation and how we're able
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
to offer this type of assistance to
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
both students and recent graduates
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh chris did you have something you
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
i summed it up uh well for us but i'd be
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
happy to help answer any of these
 
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:40.630 align:start position:0%
happy to help answer any of these
questions

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
at this point representative heath
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm a little
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
bit confused
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
about how um i'm looking on page seven
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
as you begin to describe the the debt um
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
program and i just am um
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
unclear on really how it's going to work
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
and when it's up and running what would
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
so and this might be something where
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
james you feel free to chime in as
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
is your agency would be the
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
administrator of these funds
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
but this program is designed to be
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
nimble and flexible
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
you'll notice there's language in there
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
that not only delineates some initial
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
key workforce areas to start out
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
but also invest power with the
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
through consulting with the commission
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
to identify additional
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
high priority fields that we might want
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
to extend these benefits to
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
but as far as how this would work the
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
bfa would be
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
um tasked with essentially offsetting
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
those loans of students that are
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for this program
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry recent graduates who are new
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents that are working in
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
and again to provide that existing
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
incentive a new
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
incentive to that existing workforce to
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that the high cost of student
 
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.069 align:start position:0%
make sure that the high cost of student
debt

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
debt
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
is not a barrier for them to continue to
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
work in new hampshire
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
and provide these these critical
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
benefits but james i'm happy to turn it
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
over to you
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
if there's anything else you'd like to
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody for the record
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
james key wallace executive
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
director from the ufa um you know i
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
should i'm sure like the treasurer will
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
always begin with a caveat that we can't
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
take uh positions for or against the
 
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.389 align:start position:0%
take uh positions for or against the
legislation

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
although of course we certainly
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the you know impact this
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
would have on our ability to recruit
 
00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
would have on our ability to recruit
workforce

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
in these key areas so you know i uh
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
i could take the committee through the
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
mechanics of
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
how a student loan forgiveness program
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
is proposed to work
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
if that's something the committee uh
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
would like it would just take
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
a few minutes would that be helpful
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
so this excuse me i think that would be
 
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.790 align:start position:0%
so this excuse me i think that would be
helpful

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
to let us all try to understand this
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
great thank you madam chair so this
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
legislation it really is a springboard
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
off of what was existing legislation
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know some of you may remember from a
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
few years ago
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
to provide student loan forgiveness as a
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
workforce attraction tool
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
for the regenerative medicine industry
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
you know that program was always
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
designed to be scaled up to apply to
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
other industries as
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
needed and a lot of the same
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
underpinnings you know exist here in
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
so but to speak to the legislation
 
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.069 align:start position:0%
so but to speak to the legislation
directly

00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation authorizes the bfa to
 
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.990 align:start position:0%
the legislation authorizes the bfa to
design

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
a program that meets certain key
 
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.230 align:start position:0%
a program that meets certain key
standards

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
it defines what the industries are for
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
eligible participants
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
while also acknowledging that that
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
should be a living list
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
as needs change throughout the future it
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
also says
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
basic things like they need to have a
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
degree certificate of some kind from an
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
accredited institution
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then it says bfa please design the
 
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
and then it says bfa please design the
program

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
and before you launch it the program we
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
designed would have to be brought to
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee which is the same
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
way it was done
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
with the regenerative medicine student
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness program
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
so that work had been done in prior
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
years the fiscal committee
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
during the last session was very
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about the program design
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i would imagine this would work in
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
essentially the same way and it's as
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
follows so how it works
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
is for an individual to be
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
eligible the first thing that has to
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
happen is their
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
employer has to register so their
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
employer has to be certified by us
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
that they are of the type that's allowed
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
under the legislation
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
right you know direct care health care
 
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.389 align:start position:0%
right you know direct care health care
providers

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know employees at the state hospital
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
you know there's biotechnology
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know things like that so we say yep
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
you're a valid employer
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
therefore your employees are now
 
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.150 align:start position:0%
therefore your employees are now
eligible

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the kind of boundaries on the
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
program are that
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
80 of the money needs to go to folks who
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
got their degree
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
within the last two years right so it's
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
we want to attract
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
new workforce into the state you know or
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
retain new graduates that are you know
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
here and we want them to stay
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
the other piece of the legislation says
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
whatever degree feasible try and ensure
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
that people from
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income you know people
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
who have financial need
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
are the ones targeted in the program to
 
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:52.389 align:start position:0%
are the ones targeted in the program to
try

00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
try
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
and get the money to where it's going to
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
have the most impact
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
so then after that if an individual is
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
accepted into the program
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
they will sign a five-year commitment
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
say i'm going to stay in new hampshire
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
for five years
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
they sign up we work with them we
 
00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:12.230 align:start position:0%
they sign up we work with them we
identify

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
all of their outstanding qualified
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
student loans let's say it's twenty
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of the first year assuming
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
the person has continued to work there
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
they continue to make their student loan
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
payments to their student loan providers
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
we say all right how much do you owe you
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
finish your first year
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
so out of these funds we will cut a
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
check to pay down a
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of your current student loans
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
so it gets knocked down by a child
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
year two goes by they keep making their
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
student loan payments at the end of year
 
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.750 align:start position:0%
student loan payments at the end of year
two

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
we do the same thing year three same
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
thing so each year
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
that loan gets knocked down and knocked
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
down to the point where
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
by year five your student loan is now
 
00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:56.949 align:start position:0%
by year five your student loan is now
eliminated

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
it actually you have a little bit of a
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
hidden benefit in this system
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
because since they're continuing to make
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
their payments
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
we pay down their principal their own
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
payments now less of it gets consumed by
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
interest to the student loan companies
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
and it goes more toward principal
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
so people actually pay off their own
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
loans faster
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
under the system and those advances that
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
we make
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
are technically loans to that individual
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
at zero percent no payments due no
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
interest is accruing it's technically a
 
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.710 align:start position:0%
interest is accruing it's technically a
loan

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
loan
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
we are making at the end of each year
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the fifth year
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
if they complete the program that loan
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
is forgiven
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
and they're done if for some reason
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
somebody moves away
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
and decides you know incorrectly that
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
wyoming's a better place to be
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
they actually owe that money back to the
 
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.829 align:start position:0%
they actually owe that money back to the
trust

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
and they have to pay it back on the same
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
terms as whatever they were paying their
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
student loan
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
that way the person's and so that's
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
the job so we would be in the role of
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
verifying employers employees
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
managing what would probably be you know
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
several hundred
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
counts per year enrolled into the
 
00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:08.629 align:start position:0%
counts per year enrolled into the
program

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
resolving any issues with the customers
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mary did that answer your
 
00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mary did that answer your
question

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
um yes madam chair i just could inquire
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit further
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
um to um to matt if possible please
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes you may matt um i believe
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
we had quite a conversation about this
 
00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:33.990 align:start position:0%
we had quite a conversation about this
program

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
in the last session but my big concern
 
00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:37.269 align:start position:0%
in the last session but my big concern
is

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
that um in the past millions of dollars
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
have gone well
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
number one we we failed to provide any
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
funding for the scholarship
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
the running staff program and and um
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
just it would really cause a hardship on
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
so many families
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
but secondly i think this is a a
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
a great idea but what about all the
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
students we have in the state of new
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire going to four-year
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
institutions or two-year institutions
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
who have depended on the the funds
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
that have been in the unique program um
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
and the universities
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
um across our state that depend on those
 
00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:20.069 align:start position:0%
um across our state that depend on those
funds

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
um those dollars will not get there
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean for those
 
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean for those
institutions

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
especially at um this remarkably
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
difficult period in time for higher ed
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
well representative heath what i would
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
say to that is ultimately this program
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
continues to make
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
investments in those same endowments
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
which have done
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
tremendously well over the life of this
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
program right we haven't
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen those endowments be built up
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
continue to grow
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
and we continue to make investments
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
there and just looking back to
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
what the compromise legislation was
 
00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.350 align:start position:0%
what the compromise legislation was
introduced

00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
in 2020 that would have allocated
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
say two million dollars to those
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
endowments this proposal remains
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
more generous than what was introduced
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
last session
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
right so we aren't trying to vilify the
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
endowments by any way
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
but what we are trying to do is show
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we've
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
met a certain threshold where we can
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
continue paying scholarships
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
to students out of those endowments well
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
also address
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
other emergent needs with workforce by
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
providing the student debt relief
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that ultimately we struck the
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate balance
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
to continue making investments continue
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
to pay out scholarships
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
from those endowments in addition to the
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
that goes to direct scholarships doesn't
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
also give students this glide path that
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
stay in new hampshire for five years and
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
we know that people that decide to live
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
in a location
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
for five years they become a part of
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
that community and they're more likely
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
to stay
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
and that has benefits to new hampshire
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
that go far beyond just the student debt
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
relief program
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
but again striking that balance allowing
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
those endowments to
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
continue to grow as a result
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
and ultimately again create that
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the state
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
to use these dollars which are a
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
testament to success
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
of 529 plans and make sure those dollars
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
porter you had a question
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
i do madam chair thank you i actually
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
have two questions and again these are
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
newbie questions
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know who will answer them
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me like money is being
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
taken out of the scholarship program
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
and put into this loan forgiveness
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
program am i
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
reading hearing it wrong that's my first
 
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.950 align:start position:0%
reading hearing it wrong that's my first
question

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and my and my second question is is
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
there an
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
upper limit for the loans that are
 
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.149 align:start position:0%
upper limit for the loans that are
forgiven

00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
if a student has a hundred thousand
 
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.750 align:start position:0%
if a student has a hundred thousand
dollars

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
worth of loans is a hundred thousand
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
dollars gone at the end of the five
 
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.070 align:start position:0%
dollars gone at the end of the five
years

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
or is it only maybe ten thousand dollars
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
of their hundred thousand dollars
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you matt if you would answer that
 
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.149 align:start position:0%
thank you matt if you would answer that
please

00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative porter and
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'll kick the second one over to james
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
but what i would say is that no money is
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
being taken out of direct scholarships
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
the current provision is 20
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
of the unique program funds that remains
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
at 20
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is adjusting what
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
percent goes to the university
 
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.549 align:start position:0%
percent goes to the university
endowments

00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
endowments
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
which do pay a small fraction of that
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
money in scholarships
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
but also now investing that in student
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
debt relief
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
um for individuals that live in new
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and are working in new
 
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire and are working in new
hampshire

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh and james do you have the specifics
 
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.149 align:start position:0%
uh and james do you have the specifics
offhand

00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
offhand
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think this might be something that
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative reporter
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
there's no legislative cap
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
because the amount will probably vary by
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
industry the
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
proposed amount we had put the fiscal
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee in the regenerative medicine
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
iteration of this was 50 000 recognizing
 
00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
iteration of this was 50 000 recognizing
that

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
student loan debt is a lot higher than
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
anyone's really realized
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
but also recognizing that you know you
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
can't have
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
a small number of enrollees eating up
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
too much of the fun
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
so 100 000 too much 50 000
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
felt like the ceiling um the average
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
will probably be much
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
less than that considering that this
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
program is equally open to folks
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's the cat thank you thank you
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair actually i
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
i i have a series of questions one of
 
00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.430 align:start position:0%
i i have a series of questions one of
which

00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative porter i i the the answer
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
to her question i think
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
um answered although the question the
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
first question i have is
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
um i'm on the board the 529 board
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
and i i thought that very recently we
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
had re uh rearranged the allocation
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
between the endowment and the direct
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
scholarships so that it was
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
significantly more went to the direct
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh scholarships and less to the
 
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
uh scholarships and less to the
endowment

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
endowment
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
am i and so i i think that
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
sort of when we when you said before
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
matt that it was 20 percent
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
um that went to direct scholarships i
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
thought that we had changed that
 
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.870 align:start position:0%
thought that we had changed that
recently

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh mrs madison am i wrong on that
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead good morning thank you madam
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you representative
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
um i think you know i think it was uh it
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
really good time to provide a little
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
background i think
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
before i try to answer that question i
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
think it sounds like maybe some
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislators are not familiar with the
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
actual program so i think that's how we
 
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.950 align:start position:0%
actual program so i think that's how we
can

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
um provide a little information
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
the there are two two types of
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
scholarships the
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
the direct scholarships what uh um
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
director melo is referring to the and
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
there's an endowment
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
program so funding goes to this
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
endowment program
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then in turn these endowments um
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
provide these
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
direct scholarships to um new hampshire
 
00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:34.950 align:start position:0%
direct scholarships to um new hampshire
students

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that in the rules that stated that
 
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.230 align:start position:0%
and that in the rules that stated that
is

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
80 should go to this endowment
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then um the rest which is about 20
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
goes to what we call the unique
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
annual allocation program and those are
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
direct scholarships that go
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
to students and and those are um
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
essentially the scholarships that um
 
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.549 align:start position:0%
essentially the scholarships that um
[Music]

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
the adva the college tuition savings
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
advisory commission um determines the
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria for that
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question um
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
last year in 2020 the commission voted
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
the allocation or the percentage that
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
goes to the endowments versus the direct
 
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.230 align:start position:0%
goes to the endowments versus the direct
scholarships

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
and and through that request or through
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
we spoke to the governor the governor's
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
office and the governor issued
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
an executive order to change the um
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
to change the percentage on a temporary
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
basis so what that did is he changed the
 
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.590 align:start position:0%
basis so what that did is he changed the
rule

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh for a period of one year so 70
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
would go to direct scholarships during
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
the current academic year
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the rest to the endowment so that
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
was a temporary change
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
that allowed to it did two things it
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
really expanded the eligibility for
 
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.110 align:start position:0%
really expanded the eligibility for
students

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
um because you raised the um
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
the one of the criteria the one of the
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
criteria was
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
to uh is the expected family
 
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.269 align:start position:0%
to uh is the expected family
contribution

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
before it was zero so we were able to
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
increase that to one thousand
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
and also the um and also the award
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
amount changed from
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
800 to 1000 so with the ability to have
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
more fun than in the annual allocation
 
00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:30.710 align:start position:0%
more fun than in the annual allocation
program

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
we were able to expand this scholarship
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
program and provide more scholarships
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
and more money to students during this
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
difficult time
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
so so so you're correct that that change
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
occurred but it will expire at the end
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and at that point the rules
 
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.110 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and at that point the rules
will

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
will go back to how they were
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
and then 80 will go to the endowments
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
and 20 will be for the um
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
for the direct scholarship program the
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
annual allocation program
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
right okay so but i guess what i so i
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
mean that i guess what i'm saying though
 
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.830 align:start position:0%
mean that i guess what i'm saying though
is

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
as compared to the way it is right now
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
that 70 goes to direct
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
to direct scholarship it would be
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
from that am i correct in understanding
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
that it would be from that
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
70 percent of money that goes to
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
direct scholarships right now that a
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
significant portion of that would would
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
be reallocated to
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
the debt forgiveness am i correct in
 
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.230 align:start position:0%
the debt forgiveness am i correct in
that

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
that is correct and so then the next the
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
next ques
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
i guess if i may madam chair i have yeah
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me just a moment
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
who is currently managing that uh direct
 
00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
who is currently managing that uh direct
scholarship

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
program so the the advisor commission
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
oversees this program the program itself
 
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:55.269 align:start position:0%
oversees this program the program itself
lives

00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
is housed in the treasury so treasury uh
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
makes all the disbursements and we
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
disperse all the funds to
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
all of the participating uh colleges and
 
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.350 align:start position:0%
all of the participating uh colleges and
universities

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
universities
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
so it's the college and universities
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
that are actually running the direct
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct they are the ones that
 
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.909 align:start position:0%
is that correct they are the ones that
decide

00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh and through the financial aid
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
packaging they select
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
all eligible students and they're the
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
ones that disperse
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
and award the funds the scholarships we
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
we simply manage um we provide the
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
funding to them
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
and and they report back to us with a
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
number of scholarships that they
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
award every year okay thank you
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative lynn i'm sorry continuing
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
no no no no that's fine thank you that
 
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.070 align:start position:0%
no no no no that's fine thank you that
was

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
an important clarification um i i i
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
guess the the other thing that i want to
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
make sure i'm understanding is
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
i i understand that you that that from
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
what you were saying
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh mr key wallace that there's no that
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
that this would be something that would
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
have to be decided by rules
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh but it's it sounds like if i'm
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
correct and please correct me if i'm
 
00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.230 align:start position:0%
correct and please correct me if i'm
wrong

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
that the potential amount of money that
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
would be that could be
 
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
forgiven a per individual
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
would be substantially higher i mean
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
even if
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
let's say it's you limit it to 50 000
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
that would be substantially higher
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
than the maximum amount that students
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
under the current program can get in
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
loans for i mean if i understand
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
it correctly it's two thousand dollars a
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollar scholarship for four
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
years so eight thousand dollars
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
and so i i guess what i'm concerned
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
about candidly is
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
if you compare let's say eight thousand
 
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.510 align:start position:0%
if you compare let's say eight thousand
dollars

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
under the current program to 50 000
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
under the under the loan forgiveness
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
program it that suggests that there will
 
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
program it that suggests that there will
be

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
considerably fewer people that will be
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of the
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness program than the then
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
the scholarship
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
program and i'm kind of to be honest i'm
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
really kind of concerned about
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um you know the
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
that just has a
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
quick point of clarification uh although
 
00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:16.950 align:start position:0%
quick point of clarification uh although
uh

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
i think it may have been the time by
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
budget director mayu so it won't be
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
the rules process just to be clear
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
since it'll actually be through a
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
program endorsed by the fiscal committee
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
it won't be through a
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
jail care process but um the
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
amount you know it is certainly subject
 
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.830 align:start position:0%
amount you know it is certainly subject
to

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
the approval by that fiscal committee if
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
lower the ceiling to ensure more people
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
got it
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think they could however i think
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
you're you're right
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
in that you know unless they set it at
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
eight thousand dollars which i don't
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
think they will
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
and you couldn't run i think an
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
effective recruitment tool
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
at that level you need a bigger amount
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
i do think that it will be more
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
concentrated as opposed to spread out
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is you know concentrate
 
00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:07.990 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is you know concentrate
those

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
resources in the industries where the
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
workers are most acutely needed
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
the most effective in getting those
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
folks into the state
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
as opposed to sort of spreading it out
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
you know i mean
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think the real policy your
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
consideration for the
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
legislature here is do you want to
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know help make affordability on the
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
front end by providing small amounts
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
to more people to go to the institution
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
with no guarantee whether or not they'll
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
stay in new hampshire
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
or do you want to put bigger amounts
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the hands of still a lot of people
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
but a fewer number of people with an
 
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.029 align:start position:0%
but a fewer number of people with an
absolute

00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
absolute
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
guarantee that 100 of them will stay or
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
else they have to give them money
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you james i think you
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
articulated that perfectly right this is
 
00:30:58.159 --> 00:30:58.470 align:start position:0%
articulated that perfectly right this is
a

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
highly targeted program to key
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
industries right where the existing
 
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.669 align:start position:0%
industries right where the existing
scholarships

00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
aren't tied to specific fields in the
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
same way and
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
also don't come with that guarantee that
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
people that attend the new hampshire
 
00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:11.830 align:start position:0%
people that attend the new hampshire
school

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
won't go find a job in boston for
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
example or any other part of the country
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
because we know we can export graduates
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
our challenge has been finding
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
ways to create incentives for them to
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
stay and provide workforce especially in
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
rural areas of the state
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
so then again to james point how
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
targeted and how large of an incentive
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
is the policy consideration for sure um
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
but we see the merits of this
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
being that workforce driver with
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
guaranteed benefits to stay
 
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
here within the state may i ask just one
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
more question
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
of representative berger yes you may
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and and uh the last question i
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
have is
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
um is um is
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
when the under this proposed proposed
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
program when the loan is forgiven
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
is is that a taxable event or or is
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
there some exception in the
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
irs code that says you know this kind of
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness is not
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
is not a taxable event
 
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
so i to my understanding that that is a
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
taxable event the same way that other
 
00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:19.430 align:start position:0%
taxable event the same way that other
existing

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
federal programs uh whether it be the
 
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.630 align:start position:0%
federal programs uh whether it be the
public

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh service loan forgiveness program or
 
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.149 align:start position:0%
uh service loan forgiveness program or
others

00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh this would have similar tax
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
implications to those other existing
 
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
implications to those other existing
programs

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify one thing uh this
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
program would be
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive of those so a student
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
or a recent graduate
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh couldn't participate in more than one
 
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:42.149 align:start position:0%
uh couldn't participate in more than one
program

00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
um so this would just be limited to this
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
single program but
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh to my knowledge would be taxable at
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
the end or actually would be taxable
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
james and this might be a question for
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
you but taxable at the end or
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
when each loan has been issued year to
 
00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.149 align:start position:0%
when each loan has been issued year to
year

00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and representative it's
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
also my understanding it would be
 
00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
also my understanding it would be
taxable

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
um like many other kind of you know
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
programs like that but
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's taxable upon the event of
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
forgiveness because that's when the
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
participant would need to report that as
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
for forgiveness of debt income or debt
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
cancellation income
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
which would occur collusion of the five
 
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.549 align:start position:0%
which would occur collusion of the five
year

00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
period so they would you'll be very
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
clear up front this is what your
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
eventual tax
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
increase would be you know we of course
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
coach people along the way to be
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
prepared for that
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
one caveat i would put on that is that i
 
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.470 align:start position:0%
one caveat i would put on that is that i
don't

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know this but i did read that
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the stimulus plan that the president
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
just signed
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
there were some alterations to the
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
taxability of certain student loan
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
forgiveness programs and i
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's only for federal
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
programs or if it's possible for
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
state-run programs but
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's certainly something we're looking
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
into sure
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
turcotte i believe you were next
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah i have a
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
couple quick ones if you don't mind
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
um the first one is you you uh somebody
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
was mentoring the five-year
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
commitment um
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it's i have an old copy of hb2 or
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
whatever but it
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
the one that i'm reading actually
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
somebody speak to that representative
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
turcotte which page are you
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
on it's page 71
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
second paragraph the dimension of the
 
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:49.530 align:start position:0%
five years is stricken
 
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.669 align:start position:0%
five years is stricken
[Applause]

00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
why don't you start james but what i
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
would say is we are amending an
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
existing statute that was specifically
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
tailored to regenerative manufacturing
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
so it might just
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
be a matter of that but james if you
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
have it
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
i believe that's right man but your
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
it is being proposed i see here to be
 
00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:15.589 align:start position:0%
it is being proposed i see here to be
struck

00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
struck
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the statue the proposal
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
for how the program will operate for the
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee is going to
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
have a five-year commitment if you have
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
less than that
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
i don't really think you get the bang
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
for your buck for wiping out this debt
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
um if you ask for more than that i think
 
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.069 align:start position:0%
um if you ask for more than that i think
you

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
have a high likelihood that you know
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
deal

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
can i continue madam chair with uh two
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
more quick ones
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you um
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
the second one it's kind of a theme here
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i think it was representative porter
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a couple part question
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
i guess combined
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
into one but let's say we have two
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
students with fifty thousand dollars
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
debt each um who
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
first point our first question who's
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to decide
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
how much of each of that fifty thousand
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
is forgiven who's going to be making
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh matt we can't hear you your lips are
 
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.030 align:start position:0%
uh matt we can't hear you your lips are
moving

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
moving
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
but we can't hear you sorry about that
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative i was uh double muted
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
um this would be something that the
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee would ultimately
 
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee would ultimately
endorse

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
endorse
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh to the extent that demand for the
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
program outstrips the available funding
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
um there would be a determination made
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
but again that's assuming that both
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
individuals you know are qualified they
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
meet all the criteria
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
um and again that's something that if
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's legislative intent to
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
specifically insert
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh a provision of that nature um that's
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
something the legislature
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
could certainly uh do but again it would
 
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
could certainly uh do but again it would
be

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
on an equal playing field um depending
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead with your follow-up or new
 
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
go ahead with your follow-up or new
questions

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
well yeah uh you were i was kind of
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
missing i don't know if it's on my end
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
that the uh audio's not working or
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's saying it might be
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
the room i'm in uh but i miss part of it
 
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.349 align:start position:0%
the room i'm in uh but i miss part of it
um

00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
but i can go back and look no problem uh
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
the last part
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
um is i i note that there's a
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
propensity throughout hb2 and a lot of
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
other things that keep mentioning
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
the biotech industry and and such is
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
there a particular reason why that's
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
so the existing statute and this comes
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
from the bill
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
that was passed i believe in 2018 that
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
specifically created a program for
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
advanced regenerative manufacturing
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
um these conversations that both started
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
with house bill 2 two years ago
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
and continued in 2020 have sought to
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
broaden that program um and and leverage
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
these 529 assessments
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
to provide that student gut relief not
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
only to biotechnology but also to other
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
key workforce areas such as nursing
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
or other things that are delineated both
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
and then the commissioner of bea could
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh address additional uh
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
necessary areas for workforce
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
development so i would just attribute
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
that to
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
an outgrowth of where these
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
conversations started several years ago
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
and rather than coming at this from a
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
blank plate
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
again we're continuing to build on on
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray i
 
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray i
believe

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry representative porter i
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
believe you were next
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um one of the
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
things that i've done
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
as part of my legislative duties is to
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
serve on the
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire commission for deafness
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
and hearing loss and
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
um during that work i learned that
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
there's a critical
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
shortage of interpreters for the deaf
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
and that they
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
carry quite a lot debt load and in the
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
last budget we put a line into the
 
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.790 align:start position:0%
last budget we put a line into the
budget

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
to allow their debt to be part of a debt
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program i believe that's
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
the budget did although no money was
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
allotted so my question
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
is who will be determining what
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
industries and programs
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
will be eligible for this kind of
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness is it areas where we
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
have critical shortages like
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
interpreters for the deaf or is it
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
industries that we want to encourage to
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
grow in the state like
 
00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:15.270 align:start position:0%
grow in the state like
biotechnology

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
sorry about that this bill does
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
delineate specific
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
criteria including any licensed medical
 
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.589 align:start position:0%
criteria including any licensed medical
professional

00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
which would be captured in hb2 is
 
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
which would be captured in hb2 is
introduced

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then again the authority rests with
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department of
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
and this commission to identify other
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
areas down the road
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would be good fits for this type of
 
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.230 align:start position:0%
that would be good fits for this type of
program

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
and the reason we've granted that
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
authority is for this program to remain
 
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.630 align:start position:0%
authority is for this program to remain
nimble

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
nimble
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
right right now we have a challenge
 
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.990 align:start position:0%
right right now we have a challenge
specifically

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
with healthcare workforce who's to we
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
aren't going to try to predict what the
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
needs of the state might be in five or
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
ten years
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
but given a program that has the
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
potential to be as successful as this
 
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.510 align:start position:0%
potential to be as successful as this
one

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
this can be a very effective tool to
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
address in real time
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh workforce development concerns that
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
might arise
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the future so we have an initial
 
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.630 align:start position:0%
uh in the future so we have an initial
list

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's a very uh healthcare focused list i
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and then the commissioner of bea with
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
the advice
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the commission could expand that
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
um i remember well the industry that
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
this was specifically
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
geared toward um my question is
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
well first of all i just would like to
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
say i'm deeply
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
disturbed by the fact that hundreds of
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
students will not receive any kind of
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
support as they had previously
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
as well as our universities and colleges
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
will lose a large amount of scholarship
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
money that they have to give up but my
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
is specific to those businesses
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
that will benefit and it is an
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary benefit
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
um will they be putting in
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
some funds to match these scholarships
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
or will this
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
just be a scholarship based on
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
those areas that are decided upon and
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
there's no contribution
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
on the part of the business if you could
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
reply please
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
well i guess what i would start off is
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
just to address some of your concerns in
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
the first part of that question
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
there is still money that will go to
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
university endowments
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
and that money will continue to provide
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
for scholarships
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
to students at new hampshire
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
institutions so just because we're
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
reallocating some of the funding
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the the
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
very well warranted assistance to
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
current students
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
that doesn't evaporate overnight right
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
we know that this program has
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
continued to build university endowments
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
tremendously over the past two decades
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and they're now at a spot where they
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
can continue to pay out scholarships
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
even if we're putting somewhat less
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
proportion of these uh 529 assessment
 
00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:18.069 align:start position:0%
proportion of these uh 529 assessment
dollars

00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
into those endowments
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
as for the second part of your question
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i apologize representative heath
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
what was the second part of that
 
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.910 align:start position:0%
what was the second part of that
question

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
will the businesses make any
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
contribution to the repayment
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and i know when this bill was
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
first passed in 2018
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
there was some provision um for
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
the advanced regenerative manufacturing
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
to to put
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
forward um some sum of money i don't
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
know where that stands and i'm happy to
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i guess james if there's anything
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
that you have to add that representative
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
heath's happy to respond to that
 
00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:04.309 align:start position:0%
heath's happy to respond to that
question

00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
once i have a chance to check on that
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes i represented people can have a
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
the there's nothing in the current
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that requires
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
a business to pay if their workers want
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the program
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
right because this is really a program
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
to help new workers
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
come to the state um you know it's
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
really for that individual
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the legislation that
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
says we need to get money from a
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
business to let their employees have a
 
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.270 align:start position:0%
business to let their employees have a
benefit

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
however in the proposal from the bfa to
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee we do
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
propose an administrative fee be paid by
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
the business when they first
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
sign up to have their employees all be
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
eligible this is going to help them
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
recruit workers right
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
it's actually going to be a very
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
powerful improvement tool
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
and there's some administrative costs
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
that the business should help
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
cover um in order to participate it's
 
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.069 align:start position:0%
cover um in order to participate it's
not

00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
particularly onerous because getting the
 
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.190 align:start position:0%
particularly onerous because getting the
business

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
verified that they're the right kind is
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
not that difficult
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
but they at least need to cover the cost
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray you have a
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
question yes i've got
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
um two short questions and one that's a
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
little longer the first one um
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative heath already addressed
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to sort of iterate
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
that this is a benefit to the business
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me they should have some
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
skin in the game
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
um if it should be to their benefit to
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
keep their employees so i just wanted to
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
um piggyback on representative heath i
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
something that's um rather important to
 
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
something that's um rather important to
consider

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
the second thing did i understand
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
correctly that the choices of this would
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
be made by
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee when you say fiscal
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying fiscal committee
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
i i am um representative thank you
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes and i agree skin in the game is sort
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the motto at the bfa by the way on
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
your previous point but um
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
so yes the legislation requires that the
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
student the debt forgiveness workforce
 
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:07.829 align:start position:0%
student the debt forgiveness workforce
improvement

00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
plan before any action can be taken the
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
legislation requires that the plan which
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
will include
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of the details we're talking about
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
here today the limit on the amount
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution all of that
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be approved by the fiscal
 
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
needs to be approved by the fiscal
committee

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
before operation furthermore the
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
program is subject to oversight by a
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
cross-section of legislative and other
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
of a commission that provides oversight
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
to the program
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
um representatives from the house and
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
labor others and then is tasked with
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
making annual
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the program if necessary
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
performing with respect to a fiscal
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
committee you know and
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
all the hard work they do um my first
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
inclination is that i'm not sure that's
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
the best group to make these kinds of
 
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.030 align:start position:0%
the best group to make these kinds of
decisions

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i shall have to think long and hard
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
about that but that to me
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
raises concerns about how they're going
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
to make their decisions
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
the third thing is a little bit longer
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
just basic information for me i'm just
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
kind of i've lost my road map here
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
um the first thing that confused me
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
you've changed the higher education
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
endowment to the higher education trust
 
00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
endowment to the higher education trust
fund

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
can you go over why
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
why the name change what does that mean
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
and can you just go over
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
when you're saying you know money is
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
going from here to here it's going to go
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
from endowment to scholarships to here
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
i've kind of lost
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
the thread of what's going where from
 
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.069 align:start position:0%
the thread of what's going where from
where

00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
can you just give a um sort of a
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
sure representative murray and i would
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
say on the name change
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know really just just changing the
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
focus given that
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
you know currently the endowments are a
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
large share i think that that's part of
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
the reason why it
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
focuses on endowments um just given that
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
the the reallocation of those funds
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
um the name change is just you know for
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
consistency with that
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't read into it too far other
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
than just to say
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
um trying to align you know the name of
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
the program with how the program
 
00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.470 align:start position:0%
the program with how the program
operates

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
operates
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
and then as far as where the money is
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
going are you talking the current
 
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.349 align:start position:0%
going are you talking the current
allocations

00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
allocations
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
to what we're proposing or from the
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
actual entities that
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
that administer it both i think
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
where is the money that's going into
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
there and then how
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
um and currently i think it's
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
all you you tell me so
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
these dollars come to the state from 529
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
college savings plans that are
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
administered by fidelity
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh the state takes a share of an
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
administrative fee fidelity takes a
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
share of administrative fee
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
that program has been tremendously
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
successful over the past two decades
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's been a boon to the state and its
 
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.069 align:start position:0%
it's been a boon to the state and its
students

00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
our intention is to continue that boon
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
and deploy these dollars in ways that
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
can continue to benefit
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
both current students and recent
 
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.630 align:start position:0%
both current students and recent
graduates

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
graduates
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
right now 20 percent goes to direct
 
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.109 align:start position:0%
right now 20 percent goes to direct
scholarships

00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's paid um
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
out of an accounting unit at treasury
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
and with that we are not making any
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
changes to that 20
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
that goes to direct scholarships
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
currently 80 so that remainder
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
goes to university endowments
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
this proposal will shift that
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
to a 60
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
to student debt workforce development
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
and relief
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
and 20 would stay with those endowments
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's the the high level change um
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
the bfa would be tasked with
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
program once it's up and running yes
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative murray go
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
back um and so in the university
 
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.829 align:start position:0%
back um and so in the university
endowment

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
endowment
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
right now 80 percent of the fidel
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
fidelity money goes to that
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
and you said right now um 60
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
goes nope so right now it's 20
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
to direct scholarships right 80 to the
 
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
to direct scholarships right 80 to the
endowments

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
endowments
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay excuse me excuse me
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
the treasurer said that that was changed
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
that 30 is going to endowments
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
and 70 is going to
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
direct scholarships so the 80
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
20 was old business so to speak
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
and that this new percentage runs out
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of june
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
and then it switches back to the
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so that temporary change that was
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
made for this fiscal year
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i'm not accounting for that
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
in my comments
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
given that it's temporary right so the
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
the ongoing program
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
would be that 80 20 split as of july 1st
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know the new fiscal year um
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
so i i'm trying to stay simple at a you
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
know a higher level
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
um traditionally it has been maybe 20
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
split and
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
it would go back to that at the
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
you came out with 60 for students and
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
then 20
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
so right now under current law absent
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
the temporary change that was made
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
80 20. this new proposal is
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
20 20 60.
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
20 to direct scholarships 20 percent to
 
00:51:56.559 --> 00:51:58.150 align:start position:0%
20 to direct scholarships 20 percent to
endowments

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
endowments
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
60 to student debt relief
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to do a crosswalk
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
between where we are and where this
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
language and hb2 would take us
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
the 20 for direct scholarships has not
 
00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:12.710 align:start position:0%
the 20 for direct scholarships has not
changed

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
that endowment portion
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
20 of that stays the same and then we
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
introduced a new category
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
for student debt relief without
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
remaining sixty percent
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
another way of saying that is that the
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
university endowment goes down sixty
 
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.030 align:start position:0%
university endowment goes down sixty
percent

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so again we're still providing
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
20 of the funds in that type of support
 
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:37.270 align:start position:0%
20 of the funds in that type of support
for

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
their endowments and to help students
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
with scholarships
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
through that program and again we're
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
trying to be more targeted in how we can
 
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.109 align:start position:0%
trying to be more targeted in how we can
support

00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
students after they graduate relieve
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
pressures that are tied to the high cost
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
of college
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
and provide them that debt relief
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
assuming they continue to stay in new
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire continue to work in new
 
00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire continue to work in new
hampshire

00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
and do so for five years what does the
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
university do with this
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you have a follow-up yeah a
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully just one thank you so much
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
sorry what is the
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
what does the university endowment go
 
00:53:12.839 --> 00:53:15.030 align:start position:0%
what does the university endowment go
for

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
so those dollars are used to pay
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
additional scholarships to students
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
and they pay some percentage of that
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
and again those scholarships i think
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
james d wallace and others have touched
 
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.670 align:start position:0%
james d wallace and others have touched
on

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
are small and dispersed where
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
this new student debt relief program can
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
target specific industries
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
and provide a enhanced benefit if you
 
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.589 align:start position:0%
and provide a enhanced benefit if you
will

00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
because of the enhanced benefits that
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
not only the state receives
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh but also the need to drive workforce
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
in critical sectors
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if i may just to
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
follow up on matt's
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
point yes please um so these endowments
 
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
point yes please um so these endowments
are

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
the the small disbursements that they
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
give are designed to help
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
maintain sort of the uh self-sustaining
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
nature of these for
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh these um funds uh the endowments are
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
were built they're at a healthy
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
capitalization they're able to
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
continue to you know sustain themselves
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
through through interest and
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
investments uh while dispersing a small
 
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.470 align:start position:0%
investments uh while dispersing a small
amount

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
this isn't taking money away from those
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
existing endowments
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's simply reallocating some of the
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
money that would be used to help grow
 
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:23.990 align:start position:0%
money that would be used to help grow
those

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh those endowments because we feel and
 
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.190 align:start position:0%
uh those endowments because we feel and
we've

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
seen that they've reached a healthy uh
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh balance where they're able to help uh
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
sustain themselves
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
a smaller amount maintain uh it does not
 
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.030 align:start position:0%
a smaller amount maintain uh it does not
reduce

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
those those endowments and thank you for
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
that chris
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh you were going to uh somehow or other
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
gather up uh how large the endowments
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
were for
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
all of the colleges that get some of
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes i believe we can put that together
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
um treasury i believe keeps data on that
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
but monica and i or
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
treasurer israeli and i will connect uh
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
offline and so we can report back on
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's aggregated totals or if we
 
00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:10.230 align:start position:0%
whether it's aggregated totals or if we
can

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
how many excuse me for interrupting here
 
00:55:20.079 --> 00:55:20.789 align:start position:0%
how many excuse me for interrupting here
but

00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
how many colleges and universities do we
 
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
how many colleges and universities do we
actually

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chad i can i can
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
answer that we have um we have 10
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
in and um i just would like to add right
 
00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:37.589 align:start position:0%
in and um i just would like to add right
now

00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
um the total aggregate is about 137
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars so
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
they have over time um been able to grow
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
those endowments so it is
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
it is um it is it is true that they have
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to um
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
um to continue providing scholarships so
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
the endowment program
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
is all established in the rules um
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
that the um advisor commission has um
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority to
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
to um to set those rules and and that's
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
how these two programs have been
 
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.109 align:start position:0%
how these two programs have been
operating

00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh since 2006. so um i think one of the
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
clarifications i just want to i just
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
want to make is uh
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of things this um all this fun
 
00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:19.589 align:start position:0%
a couple of things this um all this fun
then

00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
comes um to what we call an endowment so
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think there's been a little
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
um confusion um how this works the um
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
the statue rsa 630a establishes
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
the um it is an endowment trust fund and
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
we keep all of um the the proceeds that
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
come from
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
um the fidelity of send us every month
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that's where all of this funding
 
00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.390 align:start position:0%
so that's where all of this funding
lives

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
and um perhaps that's the reason why the
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
language and the status
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
shows the endowment i don't think it has
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the endowment
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
program so i just wanted to clarify that
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
um the second piece is um
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
today i'm you know sort of wearing two
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
hats i i serve on the advisory
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
commission i also
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh the treasury but um i'm trying to um
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
um as i think um
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh mr wall uh kewala said i i do not um
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
either i do not support or or be against
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
the legislation i just
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
my goal today is to provide as much
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
information as i can
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
if if there's a if there's a way to do
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
that but i know for example that the
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
advisor commissioner has a position on
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then they'll be able to um as a
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
point you know provide their
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
their views of how they see um the pros
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
and cons of this bill but
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of how the endowments
 
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:45.990 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of how the endowments
work

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
they are required to disperse
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh a minimum of four percent of their
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
balance every year
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
and what i can say is is that this
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
this particular program the endowment
 
00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.069 align:start position:0%
this particular program the endowment
program

00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
unique endowment location program was
 
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.109 align:start position:0%
unique endowment location program was
designed

00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
designed
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
to um to create scholarships in
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
perpetuity so um we we
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
fund this this this endowments every
 
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:13.910 align:start position:0%
fund this this this endowments every
year

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
sending 80 of these proceeds that come
 
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.270 align:start position:0%
sending 80 of these proceeds that come
from

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
the this administrative assessment and
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
then the the
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
the other funding goes to uh direct
 
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.069 align:start position:0%
the other funding goes to uh direct
scholarships

00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
i know the commission has discussed over
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
um they have discussed the possibility
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
of changing that allocation so
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
i just want to mention that their
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
ability to change the allocation lifts
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the rules
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
through the rulemaking authority and i
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to just
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
this the differences um with this
 
00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:46.150 align:start position:0%
this the differences um with this
proposal

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
the change will occur in the statute
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
rather than the rules so i just wanted
 
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.470 align:start position:0%
rather than the rules so i just wanted
to

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
clarify that that all this time the
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
commission has had the ability to
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions and decide where
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
the funding should go
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
but with this proposal it will stay in
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
in the law it will be set
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
again i just wanted to add those those
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
points of clarification
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so yes i think i'm not exactly
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%

i've got a couple people that will be
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
speaking from uh
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
other that are listening in to uh
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%

representative

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
lynn you have a question yes and i have
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
to i have to confess initially that out
 
00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.910 align:start position:0%
to i have to confess initially that out
that

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
about because of what i'm about to say
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
and that is because although i am a
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
member of the advi of the 529 advisory
 
00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:41.109 align:start position:0%
member of the advi of the 529 advisory
commission

00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
i had to leave the last meeting early
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
because i had to testify on some other
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and so
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know you um monica you mentioned
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
the committee had taken the commission
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
had taken a uh i guess a vote or a
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
position on this and i don't frankly
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
know what that is
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh maybe maybe you could you could
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
educate us please uh i i
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
would like to say that i don't they'll
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
be happy to testify uh
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
if they have the ability to do that what
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
i know is that the commission decided um
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
during the last meeting on march 8th
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
and it was based on a discussion
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative weiler also serves on the
 
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
representative weiler also serves on the
commission

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
and he won he was interested in
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
in proposing an amendment to the bill
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
the commission to um not have
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
that set percentage set in the statute
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
it will
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
it will i think the amendment um if it
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
has been introduced
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
um will will give the advisor commission
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to change the percentage
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
relative to that 40 so the the
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
commission decided and voted on
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
supporting the idea that the that
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
2020 that will be split between the two
 
01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:02.390 align:start position:0%
2020 that will be split between the two
programs

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
that would be um at the discretion of
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
and and so i think the amendment was
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
going to uh read that the advisor
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
commission will have the ability to
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
um to set the percentage
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
according to how they wanted to manage
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
um so that was one position that the
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
commission decided um
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
the other one is i think if if this
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
if this proposal um were not to pass
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
the commission would like to change
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
the percentage or the
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
rather than 80 20 they would like to
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
change it
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
70 30 um in the rules
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
and so if this doesn't go through the
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
commission will
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
will go ahead and vote and and change
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
their administrative rules
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
so the 70 goes to direct scholarships
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
and 30 percent will go
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the endowment program so that was the
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
decision that was made on march
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you can i have a follow-up madam
 
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.630 align:start position:0%
thank you can i have a follow-up madam
chair

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
just a moment i think i sent everyone
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative wyler's comments if i
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
didn't i apologize
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh but the what the amendment current
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
something that will not decide today but
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
it reads
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
the commission will receive 40 of the
 
01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:29.910 align:start position:0%
the commission will receive 40 of the
funds

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
which means 60 for endowment i guess
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
and will decide the split
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
between the direct scholarships to new
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
attending new hampshire institutions of
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
and the unique endowment allocation
 
01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:49.190 align:start position:0%
and the unique endowment allocation
program

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's what he sent so um
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr key wallace
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i happen to have a
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
conversation with one of the members of
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
the commission and um
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
tell me if this is wrong but i think
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
what they that
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it does
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
keep the 60 in
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
as proposed for student debt relief so
 
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:16.789 align:start position:0%
as proposed for student debt relief so
they

01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
would keep that in for student debt
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
relief then the remaining 40
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
would say the commission decides how
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
much is endowments
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
how much is it that way they can flex
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
the number
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
according to the current need i believe
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's the intent
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the commission's recommendation
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
monica please correct me if i'm wrong
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
but i think the amendment designed to
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
keep the student
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
and and that was the uh that is correct
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
that is the amendment that
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative while uh
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
wilder wasn't um had intention to to um
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
to introduce yes so
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so you know i guess um
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that really
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
concerns me and i
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
please understand i i think that this
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
debt forgiveness may to attract people
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire may well be
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
a good one um but i i am concerned about
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
one of the main reasons that we changed
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
even though it was on a temporary
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
basis the allocation between the
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
endowment and the direct
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
loans was was just as i think
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of you pointed out that the
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
the endowments are now you know pretty
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
well established and
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
are at pretty good levels and we
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh the commission had received
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
information that
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know they weren't uh they were the
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities were tending
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
to just build up those endowments and
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
not really make
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
very many uh or at least not as many
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
scholarships available as we would do
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
through direct scholarships and because
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
the commission wanted to increase the
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
number of direct scholarships that was
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
we changed the allocation so
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is sort of you know this is
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
kind of going back on that if you will
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it may be for a good reason but the
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
thing that i'm i'm wondering
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
is would this make sense to instead of
 
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.069 align:start position:0%
is would this make sense to instead of
us

01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
acting upon it now to have
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
um you know a further study done on this
 
01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:31.670 align:start position:0%
um you know a further study done on this
because

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
for example i don't i i i can see the
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
arguments on both sides of this and it
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a kind of close
 
01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.309 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a kind of close
question

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i would like
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
to know for example is
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
exactly how important are the
 
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
exactly how important are the
scholarships

01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
to the students that are getting the
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
scholarships now
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
in other words if you know uh the
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
scholarships aren't
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
aren't all that big two thousand dollars
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
as i understand it per year at the most
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
um with the given the cost of a
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
four-year even at the university of new
 
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.109 align:start position:0%
four-year even at the university of new
hampshire

01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying it's unimportant but it
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to know
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
what what percentage of of
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the of uh the total kind of financial
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
aid that's that
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
that various students get does the do
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
the scholarships represent
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
how important is it uh to them not to
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
lose that
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
versus the importance of attracting
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
of attracting uh people to stay to stay
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and work here and i'm
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if it would make
 
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if it would make
sense

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
to take a little more time to study that
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
um before we make this decision
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
i if i may i just would like to uh add
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
it because i i'm the one that sees the
 
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
it because i i'm the one that sees the
numbers

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
the number of awards that um are
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
provided i have to say that
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
the those scholarships are very
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
important to new hampshire students
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
and um i mean i have a number that um
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
the latest numbers for the endowment
 
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
the latest numbers for the endowment
program

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
just gave out 2192 awards
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
um in their range between 1 000 and um
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
thirty six thousand was one school that
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
provided thirty six thousand to one
 
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:18.789 align:start position:0%
provided thirty six thousand to one
student

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
and again it's because they have to um
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
they have to disperse that
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
four percent that they're required it's
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
a four percent minimum they have to
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
disperse from
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
four percent of the total balance so um
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
some of the scholarships are
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
really um key to some of some of the
 
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
really um key to some of some of the
students

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the annual award the annual
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
allocation program
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
that that has been difficult to fund
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
just because of that limitation
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
it always received 20 of the funding so
 
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.029 align:start position:0%
it always received 20 of the funding so
the

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
award amount was has been 800 for
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
for several years just because of that
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
the the because there wasn't enough fun
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
then it was set in the rules
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
it was 80 20. uh but with the change
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
that was made this year
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
um again the legibility criteria was
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
expanded and some more awards
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
and more money was provided so in um in
 
01:08:10.839 --> 01:08:12.470 align:start position:0%
and more money was provided so in um in
2020

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
about 4 500 awards provided to part-time
 
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
about 4 500 awards provided to part-time
and

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
in full-time students and again that one
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
it was just
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 800 and then this current
 
01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:27.669 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 800 and then this current
year

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 21
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
we we we were able to provide a thousand
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
dollar awards
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
um i don't have the data on those
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
numbers i don't have we will
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
probably have some information by the
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
end of the year by
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative lynn if i understand what
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
is that um this
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
529 commission i assume
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
would be the ones to study this
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
issue or is i don't
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
you're sort of ahead or is there some
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
other higher education commission
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
that we would uh task
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
because i don't necessarily think
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
because this money is all outside the
 
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
because this money is all outside the
budget

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken except for
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship program
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's in the budget
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
but all of this other stuff is outside
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
so it could be brought back
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
next year to um
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
to take care of and it would simply be
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
a delay of a year in how
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
this is managed i don't know uh
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
james if do you want to comment on that
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
or or do you think there's
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know we ought to go ahead i don't
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
know i know i know you don't care
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
all right so thanks
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i could if i could well
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you know what if i could just
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
say i
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
i don't i i don't really i hadn't
 
01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.709 align:start position:0%
i don't i i don't really i hadn't
thought

01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're ahead of me uh
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative umberger i hadn't really
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
thought on
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
who would do the study and i'm not sure
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
i really would
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
care um maybe it's you know maybe
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the governor's office should just
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
do that um and provide some further
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
information or maybe it should be the
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
529 commission or
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
um i i don't really have a preference on
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm just sort of thinking maybe
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
more information would be better
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair to answer your question
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're right i can't say whether i think
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
we should go forward or not
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
within a year you know what i can say
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think to kind of go along with the
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
treasurer's comments
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
about the scholarships are certainly
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
important to
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
students um you know eight hundred
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
dollars isn't
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like a lot but i'm sure
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's helpful for those that get it
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
the other side of the policy
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
consideration is if you look at
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know recent graduates their job
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
choices where they locate
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
you ask them what the most important
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
thing that they find student debt is the
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
top of the list
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
every single time you know they need
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're burdened by student debt
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
need to go to a job market that can pay
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
them you know in a way that they can
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
retire student debt
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
because the debt level is the same
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
whether you graduate from college a
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
dollar is a dollar
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
and if new hampshire's labor market
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
wages are lower it's hard to compete
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
today with massachusetts or new york
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
where you make
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
more dollars and your debt's the same so
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
you can pay it off so
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
debt is very important it's one of the
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
top things they mentioned along with
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing um
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
students or i should say students
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
employees also say that
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
study has shown a dollar of student loan
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
forgiveness is worth a lot more in
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
people's minds than a dollar of extra
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
pay so you get you get a lot of extra
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
bang for your buck
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
so i think scholarships are obviously
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
very important for people
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
that forgiveness is very important for
 
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.630 align:start position:0%
that forgiveness is very important for
folks

01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
um as well so i just wanted to
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
put that matthew did you want to comment
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
on this or did you want to comment on
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh on this topic uh sherwood if i if i
 
01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:29.669 align:start position:0%
uh on this topic uh sherwood if i if i
may

01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
um just to say that i appreciate
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative lin's comments on you
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
know making sure we get this
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
right but what i would say is that this
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
issue has had a lot of conversation over
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
expanding back to the last budget uh and
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
then subsequent conversations
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh in 2020 so what we've brought forward
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
i feel is a good compromise from where
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
the governor started his first budget
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
and through the legislative process and
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversations
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know we've come to a spot that
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
addresses challenges that we
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
we don't need to study because we know
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
they exist today the first and foremost
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
being workforce in critical sectors
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh like healthcare um so you know i
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
think the legislature
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
um you know is in a good position to to
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know make this decision to endorse
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
student debt relief for these
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
critical sectors and
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's something that i don't know we
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
need or would glean any more information
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
from a study commission because i think
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
we all have experienced that
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
issue acutely during this pandemic
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
and trying to james point uh give people
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
that incentive that
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
is meaningful as tangible and someone
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
student loans i'm currently paying off
 
01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.950 align:start position:0%
student loans i'm currently paying off
myself

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
a program like this would certainly come
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
into the equation of where would i want
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
to work after college right do i want to
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
maybe go make a few more dollars in
 
01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.510 align:start position:0%
maybe go make a few more dollars in
boston

01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
boston
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
or do i want to stay here in new
 
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.790 align:start position:0%
or do i want to stay here in new
hampshire

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
with this type of an incentive program
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
if i worked in one of those eligible
 
01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.910 align:start position:0%
if i worked in one of those eligible
fields

01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
fields
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
that would be a tangible benefit that
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or any other state
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
currently doesn't offer so there is a
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
compelling interest for new hampshire to
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
lead on that
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
point and do it now
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh rep
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%

i do madam chair thank you um
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think i'd like to get this clear in my
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
head because i might be misunderstanding
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
we had a very powerful presentation last
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
week from the university system and the
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
community college system about the
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
changing demographics and the
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
struggle to find students to attend the
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
various institutions and the competition
 
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
various institutions and the competition
between

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
will this change as proposed
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of financial
 
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of financial
incentives

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
that our local universities
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
and community colleges have
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
to attract students to come to their
 
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.229 align:start position:0%
to attract students to come to their
institutions

01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
will the pool of money that they have be
 
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.630 align:start position:0%
will the pool of money that they have be
reduced

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
will it be increased so they can in
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
in encourage more people to come or will
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
it stay the same
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so this
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
proposal relative to the university
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
endowments will continue to put
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
more money in than currently exists
 
01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.310 align:start position:0%
more money in than currently exists
today

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
so endowments obviously have a return on
 
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.229 align:start position:0%
so endowments obviously have a return on
investment

01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
the money we've put in over the past two
 
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.430 align:start position:0%
the money we've put in over the past two
decades

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
has been there has increased has grown
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they're paying scholarships on it
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
the state through this program will
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
continue to make
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
additional investments in those
 
01:16:58.719 --> 01:16:59.830 align:start position:0%
additional investments in those
endowments

01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
endowments
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
they will continue to have interests
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
they will continue to pay scholarships
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
even if we put proportionally less money
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
to them there still is an existing
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
and ongoing benefit to those endowments
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
that will continue to increase the
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
availability of those schools
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
to pay additional scholarships to
 
01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:24.149 align:start position:0%
to pay additional scholarships to
students

01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mickey maybe you could bring
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
up mr mckay first
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
good morning mr mckay i'm happy to see
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you were
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
able to uh figure out how to
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
get into our meeting we are all
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
zoom challenged so don't don't feel like
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh don't feel like you're alone we did
 
01:18:00.159 --> 01:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
uh don't feel like you're alone we did
send

01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
send
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
out your um written testimony
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
to uh all of the committee so
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
if and i know that you've heard all of
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
the comments that have been uh
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
going around and round and round on this
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
and so i just like to um
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
summary or maybe uh you know of where
 
01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
summary or maybe uh you know of where
you

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
stand on this uh this whole
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue uh and it appears that the real
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
discussion that we've been having is
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
not on the um the percentages or any of
 
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.270 align:start position:0%
not on the um the percentages or any of
that

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
but rather on the workforce
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
part of this discussion so
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate if you could um
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
give us some thoughts on that thank you
 
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
give us some thoughts on that thank you
uh

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman chairman hamburger
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
and members of
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
the division too thank you for the
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity and i
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh to speak to you today and also i
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the written testimony
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
i walk through a number of the issues
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
that have been discussed here
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
um but let me then hit the highlights if
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
and ask that the committee consider
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
honoring the commitment when the 529
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
plan was established
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
and that is to ensure that all the fees
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
received are provide scholarships for
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the residents of the
 
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.910 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the residents of the
state

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
pursuing programs to study at eligible
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
institutions within the state
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i want to follow up on the march 8th
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
commission meeting which i did observe
 
01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.229 align:start position:0%
commission meeting which i did observe
and

01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
in that meeting as monica stated near
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
the end of that meeting
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
the commission reiterated its commitment
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
to reducing
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
the proportion of the incoming fees
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
going to endowments to 30 percent
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
that was a position the commission had
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
taken last year due the inability to get
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
gel car approval
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
and went to the governor's executive
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
order process but i think it is fair to
 
01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:11.990 align:start position:0%
order process but i think it is fair to
say

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
that that's the consensus on the part of
 
01:20:14.159 --> 01:20:15.030 align:start position:0%
that that's the consensus on the part of
the

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
commission and that's the intent going
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
forward so 70 percent of the incoming
 
01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
forward so 70 percent of the incoming
fees

01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
under the commission's perspective and i
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
understand they need to jail car
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
approval for this
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
this change would be to have the fees
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
go to either the annual award or the
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
as stated previously the annual award is
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
particularly effective
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
for serving adult learners and others
 
01:20:39.199 --> 01:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
for serving adult learners and others
coming

01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
directly from school but particularly
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
adult learners who are key to meeting
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
our workforce needs
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
as as many of you know i've worked a
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
long time on workforce issues with 65 by
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
25 and so forth
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
and the biggest opportunity for the
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is to look at
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
those 140 000
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
adults in the state who have some
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
college but have not completed
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
a degree or a high value credential and
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
by providing the aid through the
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
annual award we're particularly focusing
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
on that population
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship program has
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
been exclusively funded
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
from general fund support to date it's a
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing appropriation
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
and by um and under the modeling that
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
i've done
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
and others with spreadsheet that program
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship program plus
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
the annual awards plus the 30
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
allocation to the endowment program is
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
fully sustainable
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
from fee incoming 529 fees and there
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
will be no
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
future general fund appropriation needed
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
to support
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship or any other
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
element and why is that important
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
because that provides long-term
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
assurance to the families in new
 
01:21:47.679 --> 01:21:48.390 align:start position:0%
assurance to the families in new
hampshire

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
they will have access to student
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
financial aid for students
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
in state and to go back to
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter's question and
 
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
representative porter's question and
others

01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
one of the key issues for us now as we
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
face these demographic headwinds
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
is providing insurance to new hampshire
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
families that aid will be there
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
so they can stay in state right now
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're losing almost half our students
 
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:08.790 align:start position:0%
we're losing almost half our students
pursuing

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
pursuing
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
pursuing two or four year degrees going
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's critically important that we
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
provide that assurance of these families
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
with financial need that if you stay in
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
state you can not only enroll in state
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
but you can accelerate your degree in
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
the sense of going full-time you have
 
01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.189 align:start position:0%
the sense of going full-time you have
more

01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
aid and again by my own modeling
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
i believe the uh the current one
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar annual award could be
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
increased to fifteen hundred so i walked
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
through in the written testimony the
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
the total uh fee amount coming in 17 to
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
18 million
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
deducting at 30 for the endowment
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
program you take off the audit and other
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
required fees you have
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
roughly give or take 12 million dollars
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
available for the annual for the
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh annual award program in the
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
again those are fully funded uh in
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the foreseeable future uh from those
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
two sources
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
and let me speak again also to the value
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
endowment program as monica has
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
correctly stated there's a minimum of
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
four percent that has to be paid out
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
each year and that that amount is
 
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
each year and that that amount is
growing

01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
substantially each year but not only
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
that there's not a dime of
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that can be
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
assessed against those endowments
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's been a critical feature in the
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
creation of programs such as the granite
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee knowing there was a governor's
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship program annual war
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
program and the endowment which provides
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
the flexibility for financial aid
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
officers to package a program such that
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
you can then make the offer of the
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
granite guarantee
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
and essentially making new hampshire
 
01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.310 align:start position:0%
and essentially making new hampshire
residents

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
residents
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
who are pedal eligible be able to go to
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
residential campuses and universities
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
free tuition-free
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
so again there's major improvements here
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the future is is tremendous for
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
these programs but i also
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
think it's important to address the
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
other aspects of what is
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
proposed by the diversion of the 60 fees
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
um we've had a lot of discussion james
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i and others have talked and we've
 
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.310 align:start position:0%
and i and others have talked and we've
testified

01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
previously on is this the best use of
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
those fees let me suggest that
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
with the initial cares act which was
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
approved last march
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the first time businesses can deduct
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
up to five thousand two hundred and
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
a year for payments to employees to
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
reduce their student debt their debt is
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
immediately reduced by the 5
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
250 now that was only a one-year
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
provision but in the second iteration of
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
the cares act
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
approved by congress in december they
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
put a five-year window on it
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
so this is good for five years and
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's very very strong bipartisan
 
01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:44.950 align:start position:0%
there's very very strong bipartisan
support

01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
so i think that program exists long term
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
so every business that wants to help pay
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
down student debt
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
has a deduction which again is also
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
other come to me i think that's going to
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
be tax free to the
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
the employee receiving that payment to
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
pay down the principal on the student
 
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:00.709 align:start position:0%
pay down the principal on the student
debt

01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh so that's another benefit of that now
 
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.229 align:start position:0%
uh so that's another benefit of that now
if

01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
the trouble with for and again james
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
understands this and he's been very
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
honest and candid about
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
how to present the trouble of forgivable
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
loans to millennials
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
they say wait a minute it's you're
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
substituting one loan for another
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't my debt's not reduced for
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
five years but
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
millennials say five years that's a
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
lifetime i mean you know what what
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
happens do i
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
get married have a kid i do something
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
else so forgivable loans are not an
 
01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.470 align:start position:0%
else so forgivable loans are not an
attractive

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
option generally for millennials or
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
young young people
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
it does not enable them to reduce their
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
aggregate debt
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
they delay household there's no
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
acceleration of household formation
 
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.149 align:start position:0%
acceleration of household formation
which

01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
basically if there's a way to pay down
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
the debt more quickly then that's much
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
more attractive to millennials
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
so let me suggest an alternative that
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
i've suggested before
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
if there's an interest on the pardon
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
businesses in new hampshire or
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
industries identified by the governor's
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
office or others that
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
really are critical to this thing then
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
why not simply
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
provide a tax credit against the
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
business profits tax or the business
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax for the amount
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
over 5250 which is already a tax
 
01:26:08.239 --> 01:26:09.189 align:start position:0%
over 5250 which is already a tax
deduction

01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
for example if i'm one of these army
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
companies and i wanna
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
pay down ten thousand dollars and that
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be immediately off the student's
 
01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:16.470 align:start position:0%
would be immediately off the student's
debt

01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
then i could take the five thousand two
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
hundred fifty dollar
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
federal deduction in addition take a tax
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
credit of four thousand seven hundred
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
you talk about big bang for your buck
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it will only go to the companies
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
that have skin in the game that are
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
partnering with the state
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
and are aggressive in saying we want to
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
help you attract
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
and retain young employee young
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
professionals to this state
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i think there are more cost-effective
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
ways to achieve the goal
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office and others
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
while also maintaining
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
that revenue stream for new hampshire
 
01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:53.669 align:start position:0%
that revenue stream for new hampshire
families

01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to provide
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
support for new hampshire students going
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
students with financially going to
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
college in new hampshire
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
where they are far more likely to secure
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
a workplace
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
internship or practicum experience and
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
then stay work and play
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i apologize for going
 
01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:12.790 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i apologize for going
on

01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative bombardo i have some real
 
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:16.390 align:start position:0%
representative bombardo i have some real
energy

01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
my question to you is that um
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
some of this loan forgiveness was going
 
01:27:30.639 --> 01:27:31.350 align:start position:0%
some of this loan forgiveness was going
to

01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
um people that were working for the
 
01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.669 align:start position:0%
um people that were working for the
state

01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes and um so my if i could
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
i i in the the written testimony i
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that the governor's office had
 
01:27:43.199 --> 01:27:43.910 align:start position:0%
suggest that the governor's office had
proposed

01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming biennium three million a
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
year to support the governor's
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
scholarship program again that's not
 
01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.750 align:start position:0%
scholarship program again that's not
necessary

01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
under the plan that would retain all the
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
529 fees within the 529 commission
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
so repurpose the six million dollars and
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
provide it to the state loan repayment
 
01:27:59.679 --> 01:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
provide it to the state loan repayment
plan

01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's administered by hhs for those
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
health centers and other
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit industries
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone know if that 6 million is
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
still in there or if it's gone
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't all speak at once if i may madam
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
chair um the six million is yes so the
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
um we're being we're budgeting three
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
million each year so that's the six
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars that um
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
um mr mckay is referring to and and that
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
is in treasury's budget
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
my my understanding however is uh
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
division one has moved to
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
recommend reducing that that
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation essentially to nothing
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to just keep us in the
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
loop with what division one
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
is recommending for that program that
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
was my
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
understanding as well so good thought
 
01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:53.189 align:start position:0%
understanding as well so good thought
but

01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
hey um i see catherine provencher is
 
01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.070 align:start position:0%
hey um i see catherine provencher is
here

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
are you going to speak for the
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
university side
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
good still morning good morning chair
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
um i'll take this one i really think um
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
much has been already said so i just
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to reiterate a couple of points
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
again um catherine provencher chief
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
administrative officer
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
university system um the
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
i i would like to point out that um the
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
two programs
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
differ i'm not taking a position on the
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
value of either program but one program
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
is workforce business and economic
 
01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.830 align:start position:0%
is workforce business and economic
development

01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
and one program is uh
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
scholarship dollars for the various
 
01:29:50.239 --> 01:29:51.030 align:start position:0%
scholarship dollars for the various
needy

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
needy
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
i mean the the neediest students when
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an estimated family
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
contribution of zero
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
these are our neediest new hampshire
 
01:29:58.719 --> 01:30:01.189 align:start position:0%
these are our neediest new hampshire
students

01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
the the other point i wanted to
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
reiterate i attended my
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
first unique commission meeting a week
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
ago today
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
since i had been state treasurer and i
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
do want to
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate the point that monica made
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the committee the commission
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
made two votes one
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
if the program is to move forward as
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
written in house bill two
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
the commission would seek to have
 
01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.550 align:start position:0%
the commission would seek to have
flexibility

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
with that twenty percent twenty 20
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
there's a recognition on the part of the
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
unique commission
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
that we need to get dollars into
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
students hands
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
now and so the commission may
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
may um seek to have
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the 40 go directly
 
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.110 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the 40 go directly
to

01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
to annual scholarships the second part
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the motion was
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
should this legislation
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
not proceed as written in house bill 2
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
the commission would immediately move to
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
jailcar to have the
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
split between annual scholarships
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
and an endowment portion moved to
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
70 direct 30 endowment
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
as is currently the case for this
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
one year temporary allocation um
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
that that's that's about it for me again
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the
 
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.430 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the
worthy

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
worthy
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
the worthiness of either program i think
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're both
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
they both have could
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
have we don't know but could have
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
really high impact on the state
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
but um the the best of both worlds of
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
of course would be able to do both
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
so so i'm going to leave it at that and
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions i did
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
um you probably already know this and i
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
think mr mckay mentioned this
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
the the it's 18 and a half
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year that's coming in
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
through these fidelity assessments
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a big
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
chunk of of dollars coming in
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
and so 60 going to
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
the um the debt relief program
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be about 10.8 million dollars a
 
01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:35.990 align:start position:0%
would be about 10.8 million dollars a
year

01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to the debt relief and then the 40
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
would be 7.2 million combined
 
01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to to the scholarships so
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
it is a um and those i said the
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
estimates are it's about 18 and a half
 
01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
estimates are it's about 18 and a half
million

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
almost for fiscal years 21 22 and 23.
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
i used 18 million because you know we
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
have to pay for an
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
audit and there is some administrative
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
costs but that that's just an
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
estimate madam chair
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
kathy could i maybe add just two quick
 
01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.470 align:start position:0%
kathy could i maybe add just two quick
items

01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
and again i apologize if mr mckay didn't
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
mention these uh and madame treasurer i
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
think you you would mention that 10
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities are
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
participating in the program
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious if you were actually
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
combining usnh and ccsnh sort of as
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
as one entity there uh it was my
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that essentially every
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
college and university in the state
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
is eligible to participate
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
if i can hop in monica just to clarify i
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
think that's what you meant is there's
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
five uh
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
private institutions plus the 11
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
institutions in the community college
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
university so a total of 16
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
current participants that is correct we
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
combine them yes
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
great thank you um and then just to
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the questions that was sort
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
of being asked and i think kathy just
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
this morning sent over the fiscal now
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
note for the university system but in
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
terms of the endowment and again mr
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
mckay definitely spoke to this but
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
our estimate is through the diversion
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
if the commission doesn't change the
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
allocations which there are they are
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
talking about doing
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
but even if you kept it at 80 20 um
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
that means about 200 000 every single
 
01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.390 align:start position:0%
that means about 200 000 every single
year

01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
in less money able to come out of the
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
endowments to scholarships
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that's two thousand dollars in year
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
one plus two thousand two hundred
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
thousand more in year two
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
plus two hundred thousand more in year
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
three on and on and on so
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
again the way the endowments work and
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
they continue to build and make money
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
as this can as this can this diversion
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
continues it really does become a very
 
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.390 align:start position:0%
continues it really does become a very
significant

01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
pot of money that is no longer available
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
for student loans
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh james did you want to comment on that
 
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.790 align:start position:0%
uh james did you want to comment on that
or

01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
was it something else yes uh if i could
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair i just
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know wanted to also point out i
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
think in addition to tom's point so
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
the 200 000 i'm not sure exactly how the
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
map works i assume that's the four
 
01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.149 align:start position:0%
map works i assume that's the four
percent

01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
that four percent of what wouldn't be
 
01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:07.830 align:start position:0%
that four percent of what wouldn't be
going

01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
to endowments in the future it's not
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars less than
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
what is being given out
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
now it's sort of two hundred thousand
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
dollars less a year that
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
might be given out more than what's
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
going away now so
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
the trade-off would be keeping it
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
as it is now or it would go up like
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
200 000 a year if you don't have that
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
increase of 200 grand a year
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
what you gain is 10 million a year
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
student debt
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
relief you lose 200 000 a year
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
in school that's right james just to be
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
clear though that 200 000 is
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
just the usnh portion it does not
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
account for
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much a similar 200 000 going
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh matt did you have something on this
 
01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.149 align:start position:0%
uh matt did you have something on this
issue

01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
sorry about that can you hear me now
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
just just clarification that when thomas
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i think james touched on this but
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that is not a
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
real reduction in what we're paying out
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
the delta between the continual
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
increases and the continual
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
disbursements to the fund
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
which will continue to increase as
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to the status quo so just want
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're talking reductions
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
they are potential as opposed to uh
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
actual dollars currently in endowments
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
which we would see additional
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's right that's matt and james have
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
it right
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
right but right when we prepare a fiscal
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
note we have to compare
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
what the current rule says
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
compared to what the few the legislation
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
says so currently you'd have
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
80 percent going into endowments and
 
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.550 align:start position:0%
80 percent going into endowments and
that

01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
over time translates to those dollars
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
not going to endowments
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
results in two hundred thousand dollars
 
01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.229 align:start position:0%
results in two hundred thousand dollars
less

01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent petrie did you have a
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
question on this or was it on something
 
01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.470 align:start position:0%
question on this or was it on something
else

01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you madam chair uh i was
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
just wondering what the total
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
student debt was in the state of new
 
01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.950 align:start position:0%
student debt was in the state of new
hampshire

01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that anyone has a
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
clear idea of
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
how much student debt there is in the
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay i think the last statistic i saw
 
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
where students that do have debt the
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
average debt was around thirty seven
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in new hampshire
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
that's a ballpark figure but i think
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's close
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you see that
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh mick has brought up a couple of
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh people to uh to talk to us
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
and uh mr williams you were up first i
 
01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.109 align:start position:0%
and uh mr williams you were up first i
believe

01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
yes hello uh thank you uh for having me
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative umberger my name is
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
alfred williams i'm the president at
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
river valley community college and i'm
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
represented in the community college
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
system in new hampshire
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why i'm here today is
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
that i have a extensive background in
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
financial aid and
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
i started in higher education when i was
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
in law school as a graduate assistant in
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
financial aid and
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
in all my years in higher education i
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
have either directly supervised or ran a
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
financial aid office
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
um we're not taking a position on the
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation but i just wanted to
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
point out some of the ways that the
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship program impacts community
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
college students
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
our students uh the
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
the the it seems like it may be small
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
amounts but those small amounts have a
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
significant impact on our students a
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar award
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh 1500 award can mean the difference
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
between taking
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
a class uh taking an additional class
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
finishing as quickly as possible
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
and our students stay in new hampshire
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
that you know our graduates all take
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
jobs for the for the most part the
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
majority of them in new hampshire
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we can see that the impact
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
particularly of the unique annual funds
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
geared towards full pell students has a
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
real impact on changing
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
getting people out of poverty if you
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
look at river valley community college
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
and white mountains community college
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
they have the highest some of the
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
highest rates of income jumps
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
of any community colleges in the country
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh where students
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
jump from the lowest fifth of income to
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
the three-fifths of income within five
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
years of graduation
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
and some of that is a direct result of
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
the funding that goes to those full pell
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
students to get them through as quick as
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
possible and get them into the job
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
job force so we can see that the the
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
scholarships have a real impact on our
 
01:39:51.119 --> 01:39:51.830 align:start position:0%
scholarships have a real impact on our
students

01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
a real impact on their ability to get
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
into the workforce and uh and and work
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
so if i'm hearing oh you're not take
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
you're not taking a position
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you is there anybody out
 
01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:08.050 align:start position:0%
there that's taking a position
 
01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:10.870 align:start position:0%
there that's taking a position

the nhcuc but if you aren't i'll just
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%

here in new hampshire um and these
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
institutions are really recognized
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
and highly regarded for their
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
outstanding research
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
teaching community service activities
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
and they serve certainly as major active
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh major centers of activity that are
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
vital to the economic development of the
 
01:41:02.239 --> 01:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
vital to the economic development of the
community

01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
and to our state and i also serve
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
as the newly elected chairperson of the
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire college tuition savings
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
plan which we'll refer to
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
for ease purposes as unique today
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
many people have made um i think some of
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
most important salient points already
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
there's a couple i just like to really
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
reiterate um and i guess the most
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
important one to me is really that the
 
01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.350 align:start position:0%
important one to me is really that the
monthly

01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
the fees the annual fees generated by
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
are used and have been used exclusively
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
to since its inception
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
very successfully to provide
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
scholarships to our neediest new
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire students
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
and their families attending new
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire schools so again it's a new
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire program very
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
through and through um i also want to
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that we've been clear about
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
the extensive
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
reach that this particular program has
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
and so since its inception
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
the 529 commission or the unique
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
commission has awarded more than 72
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
000 scholarships again to
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
to our neediest new hampshire students
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
helping the students get an education
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
stay and succeed right here in new
 
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.709 align:start position:0%
stay and succeed right here in new
hampshire

01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
those two are very important things we
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
um treasurer mazzapelli did a great job
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
sort of talking about what
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh motions were made at our meeting just
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
a week ago
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important to
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
reiterate a couple of things from there
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
that when we talked about making uh the
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
70 30
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh split um that it had worked well and
 
01:42:38.639 --> 01:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
uh split um that it had worked well and
that

01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
we would do as a commission
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
vote to make to make that change
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
permanent if we were able
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
to take that opportunity that it is
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
definitely the
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
commission's intent to make that
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
permanent and while there was really
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
no position taking on the worthiness of
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
the bill or the proposal
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
in hb um two we as a commission realize
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
it could happen
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we want to be sure that people know
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
um that we
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
are very flexible um as a commission and
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
willing to to work with folks
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
um again you know under this proposal
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
non-new hampshire students would
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
not have um necessarily
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
the same kinds of intentionality around
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
the focus on new hampshire media
 
01:43:24.159 --> 01:43:25.510 align:start position:0%
the focus on new hampshire media
students

01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of unknowns with this
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
particular proposal as
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
as folks have stated stated when it was
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
started it was
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
considered a pilot and now under this
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
proposal will be codified really in this
 
01:43:38.719 --> 01:43:39.270 align:start position:0%
proposal will be codified really in this
issue

01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
and posed to grow substantially over
 
01:43:42.639 --> 01:43:43.590 align:start position:0%
and posed to grow substantially over
time

01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
and certainly while workforce
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
development is an important
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
program for new hampshire it should
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
really not be untaken i don't think at
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
the expense of scholarship for new
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire's neediest students
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
and the final point i want to make is
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire's funding for
 
01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.910 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire's funding for
scholarships

01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
general student scholarships is
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
extremely low relative to other states
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
and when you compare new hampshire
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
expenditures against other states and
 
01:44:09.119 --> 01:44:10.709 align:start position:0%
expenditures against other states and
territories

01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
territories
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
over the time we have ranked second from
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
in total dollars spent by the state so
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
the the challenge here i think is that
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
this these are there are no
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
other funds really being committed at
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
the level that we're talking about here
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
so we certainly encourage new hampshire
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
legislators to honor the successful
 
01:44:29.679 --> 01:44:30.629 align:start position:0%
legislators to honor the successful
program

01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
um that unique has had and our
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
long-standing compact with the families
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
and students of new hampshire who
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
directly benefit from these scholarships
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you deborah
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
a representative lynn you have a
 
01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.950 align:start position:0%
a representative lynn you have a
question

01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and i i this
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
is i guess would be directed
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
to either matt or james am i
 
01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:56.629 align:start position:0%
to either matt or james am i
understanding

01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
correctly that under the under the loan
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
there would not be a requirement that in
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
order for a person to be
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for that the person had
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
to have attended
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
college in new hampshire and and i guess
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
if and if that's true
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
then i guess my only question would be
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
we we do do that for the for the
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship program we say it only
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
applies if you're going to school in new
 
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.390 align:start position:0%
applies if you're going to school in new
hampshire

01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
and you know i that's a choice
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
presumably to encourage
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
people to go to school in new hampshire
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
which is i'm not
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know that i'm not saying that's a
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
bad thing i'm just
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just making that observation and so
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
if we do that
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the scholarship program would it
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
make sense to
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
put that as a requirement on the loan
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program that we want you to
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
stay in new hampshire and
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
if you know if you've gone to school in
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire maybe there's a better
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
chance you're going to stay in new
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so this will be just sort
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
of a further incentive
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't know the answer to that but i
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
just asked the question
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
no and that's a very fair question
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
you're correct that the legislation does
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
not require them to have
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
attended a new hampshire institution but
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
they would need to be a new hampshire
 
01:46:12.639 --> 01:46:13.590 align:start position:0%
they would need to be a new hampshire
resident

01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
resident
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
working for a new hampshire company
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
that the idea there is to cast the
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
broadest net possible to address the
 
01:46:20.159 --> 01:46:21.109 align:start position:0%
broadest net possible to address the
workforce

01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
sectors that we're trying to again
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
incentivize people to continue to live
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
and work in new hampshire
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted to further
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
restrict that to
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire graduates that live in new
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire that work in new hampshire
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
the the committee could take that action
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
but again it just restricts
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
that pool and also limits the
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
possibility for this proposal to attract
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
new workforce to new hampshire um and
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's the consideration that we just
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
would need to balance
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
you representative heath
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes thank you um and
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
this question
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
um is for either deb scary and it's nice
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
to see your deb
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
or um catherine provencher who actually
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
weren't you one of the architects of of
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
the unique program but my real question
 
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.390 align:start position:0%
the unique program but my real question
is

01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
what would really this program benefits
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
um all our colleges are all our new
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire colleges and universities
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
be they public or private what will be
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
the overall
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
impact to our institutions if
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
the if this program were to be changed
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mary i can i can start and
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
kathy please
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
build on here i think you know we've
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
we've just stated
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's um it's a huge uh amount 60
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
off the top um that would not be going
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
to scholarships i guess that's the
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
the piece that's you know important um
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the fact number two is that there
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
are no other resources that we really
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
have in new hampshire
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
that would be able to really make up for
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is you know this is what we point
 
01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:05.750 align:start position:0%
this is you know this is what we point
to

01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
when we talk about um aid to students at
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i think you know it would be profound
 
01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.510 align:start position:0%
so i think you know it would be profound
thanks

01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath no i was
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
not the architect of this program
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
that goes back to mike about
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
and governor shaheen oh okay
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
um i want to reiterate
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
what matt and james have said earlier
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
under current rule there will be no
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
change in direct scholarships
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the endowment scholarships that are
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
paid out right now will continue
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
to be paid out at the same
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
level they are right now
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
it you know it would the way the
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
endowment works is
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
monica mentioned um i think the total is
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
137 138 million across
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
the state and all the in all the
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
the university systems portion of that
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
is 67 million dollars
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
as of last june 30. the way in and down
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
and this is like most endowments the way
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
this works is we take the
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
average balance over the market value
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
over the last 12 quarters you apply
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
four percent to that and it will pay out
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
at that rate and those scholarships go
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
to the neediest new hampshire students
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
so without the endowment growing further
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
those amounts will still continue to pay
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
out now over time
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
it won't keep up with inflation but if
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
you had a portion of it going to
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
two endowments it will keep up with
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
inflation but again
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
the the endowment won't grow so more
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
scholarships won't be available in the
 
01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.669 align:start position:0%
scholarships won't be available in the
future

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
now that's again that's it existing rule
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
as is with this 80 20 split
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
the answer changes if in fact
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
the rule were changed as voted by the
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
commission to go
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
70 percent for
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
annual scholarships and 30 for endowment
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
to keep up with inflation
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
right seven right now 20 percent of 18
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
is 2.6 million 3.6 million dollars
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
so that is about the amount that's being
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
paid out in
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
annual direct scholarships
 
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
per year if that number changed to 70
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
percent of the 18 million dollars
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
now we're paying out 12.6 million
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
in direct scholarships am i con
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm probably confusing the issue it's
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
already so confusing
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh no actually surprisingly it makes
 
01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:11.350 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:15.750 align:start position:0%
sense to me
[Laughter]

01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
sorry representative lynn you have a
 
01:51:19.119 --> 01:51:22.950 align:start position:0%
sorry representative lynn you have a
question

01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
oh no i'm sorry i don't know how my hand
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
got up i do not have a question thank
 
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
got up i do not have a question thank
you

01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
down

01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
i think we all have a lot of thinking to
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
do on this i
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
really really appreciate
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's comments today and
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
it certainly has helped me
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
in understanding this
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
entire proposal as i read it
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
every you know every time i read it i
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
came up with different thoughts but i
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
think i have
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
now at least a clear understanding of
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
what is in hb2
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
and obviously we've got
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
um i we have
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
i think i'm also hearing that we don't
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
want to put the percentage in
 
01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:29.430 align:start position:0%
want to put the percentage in
legislation

01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
but rather what we want to do is
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
give the unique program the ability to
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
change that
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
in rules and i don't know if that's the
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
way the legislation is right now or
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's some something else uh but
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
you don't want it to be in legislation i
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
i got that
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
totally and i can i can
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that happens if um
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
if it isn't that way right now and
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
as i said um we're going to have to
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
um the workforce issue
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
is obviously of concern
 
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.510 align:start position:0%
is obviously of concern
and

01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the workforce
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
what do i want to say i think it's a
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
to highlight particular
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
industries where we are really
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
suffering from not
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
having sufficient people to be there but
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
on the other hand uh mr mckay has said
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
that um you know the businesses
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh can already get a
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
tax deduction for
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
paying that so these are just some of
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
the issues that
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna have to
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
um to work out and obviously
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it today but
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
um we are going to have to do it soon
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
so put your thinking caps on and
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
um because if we need to
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
redo legislation uh
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've got to give mickey some kind of
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
about where we're going uh because you
 
01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:37.270 align:start position:0%
about where we're going uh because you
can't

01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know you can't just say well mickey
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
make this up
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh so i although i'm sure he could do a
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
very good job
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
with it but uh but we do need to uh to
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
give him some
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
some ideas as to where we are
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh that we can get some kind of
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
consensus on so
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
that we will recess until
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
one o'clock when we're going to tackle
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
another issue that
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
obviously will be a problem
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe or maybe not and that's
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
a new commission of
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
looking at um the uh
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
lorry list problem if that's the right
 
01:55:35.119 --> 01:55:36.229 align:start position:0%
lorry list problem if that's the right
term

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
so that'll be that'll be another another
 
01:55:39.199 --> 01:55:39.589 align:start position:0%
so that'll be that'll be another another
fun

01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
fun
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon so uh we'll see you all
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
