00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
here Mr Speaker one commissioner does
 
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
not a commission make the commission I'm
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
referring to is the Pu the Public
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the Pu sets the
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
rates for the regulated utilities it
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
also makes various
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
Rules by Statute the Pu comprises three
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners one of whom chairs the
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
commission also by Statute the Pu chair
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
has the same powers and abilities and
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
duties as any Commissioner of an
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
executive department these powers
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
include Ru making which is what this
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
bill is about current statute says that
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
the Pu chair can make rules on their own
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the other two
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners agree with the
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
rules this bill says that when the puc
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
adopts rules at least two of the
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners must agree to these rules
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
because one commissioner does not a
 
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
because one commissioner does not a
commission

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
make the only opposition to this bill
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
and testimony came from the Pu now
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's because the bill as introduced
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
also says that when the Pu holds a
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
hearing at least two Commissioners must
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
be present the Pu testified that they
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
often have just one commissioner present
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
at a hearing and sometimes just staff
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
and no Commissioners they said that they
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
would need a special commissioner on
 
00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
retainer which would create an
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure okay I responded with an
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that eliminates the
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
expenditure it's 0249 on pages 34 and 35
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
of the House calendar it takes just just
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
a few seconds to read hint hint the
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
amendment leaves the current practice
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
for hearings unchanged so that no
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
special commissioner on retainer is
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
needed and hence no expenditure and
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
simply says that rules must be adopted
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
by a majority of the Pu a majority means
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
at least two Commissioners even if
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
positions are vacant again one
 
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner does not a commission make
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
at the executive session the majority of
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
our committee refused to even discuss
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
this amendment much less vote on it I
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
ask the body to overturn the itl motion
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
so that we may consider this simple
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that requires a majority of
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
the Pu Commissioners to adopt rules I
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
also want to address the majority
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
reports objection to the bill defining
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
the Pu as a regulatory
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
agency the puc adopts rules but does not
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
enforce them how do I know the Pu chair
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
told us so during an informational
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
presentation to our committee last month
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
a slid mentioned enforcement and I asked
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
pu chairman goldner to elaborate here is
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
what he said quote so what I meant to
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
say was that the enforcement element and
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
audit element in that slide went over to
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
the doe that's the department of energy
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
so there was no enforcement there is no
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
audit within the current pu so I had
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
meant to say that they had shifted over
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
to the Department of energy unquote so
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
the puc is indeed a regulatory agency I
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
ask my colleagues to overturn the itl
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
motion so that we may consider the
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
amendment and make it clear that one
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner does not a commission make
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
again I ask you to please take a few
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
seconds really just a few seconds to
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
read Amendment 0249 starting on page 34
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
of the calendar thank you Mr Speaker and
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I request a division
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas well thank you Mr
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker I'm sure you'd be
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
happy to know that we're not going to be
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
talking about energy technology or
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
science on this bill we're really
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
talking more about common sense which
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
this Bill acts
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker it is true that current law
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
does not require Commissioners to be at
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
ordinary public hearings or any meetings
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
where there's no binding vote it is true
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
that they have uh people called staff
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
examiners that will listen to public
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
hearings and they'll provide these notes
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
and transcripts to the Commissioners so
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
that when it does come time for a
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
binding vote as the law requires two
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners must be present for that
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
binding vote to do otherwise like this
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill implies would merely delay greatly
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of proceedings imagine we only
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
have three Commissioners so if two can't
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
make an ordinary public hearing and they
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
have to delay it it could be weeks
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
before that public hearing is is done
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
further delaying pu action so it makes
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
sense in this case that we don't require
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners to be at every single
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
meeting that this bill would require re
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
ired it's common
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
sense so and although in the past where
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
in some cases where binding votes are
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
required the Pu has had to hire an extra
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner to fill in at that time at
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
some expense this bill would require one
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
to be held on standby virtually every
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
time there might be any type of a
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
gathering or meeting of the Pu further
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
incurring more
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
expense again it makes sense not to do
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
that and of course the one person that
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
did require this bill was the Office of
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
Consumer Advocate and the primary
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor and they were the only people to
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill and the Bill had very
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
little public
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
support so I would say that we instead
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
of complicating and delaying the puc's
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
action we should in fact take the common
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
sense approach let's press the green
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
button and it itail this Bill thank you
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has requested a
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
division members take your seats this
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
clear the motion before us is the
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
majority report of inexpedient to
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
legislator and House Bill 169 this is a
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
division vote chair recognized
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
governing bodies at all
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
levels such as Town select boards school
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
boards City
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
councils our state's Public Utilities
 
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.029 align:start position:0%
councils our state's Public Utilities
Commission

00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
and countless other local state and
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
federal committees and commissions are
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
composed of multiple
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
members to ensure that a diverse range
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
of perspectives and expertise are
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
brought to bear on the decisions they
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
make and if I
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
know that current New Hampshire statute
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
is being interpreted to allow a single
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
member of our three member Public
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to issue rules
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
dictating policy and practice for our
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
State's numerous regulated Public
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
Utilities affecting every single
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
resident and business of our state
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the other two
 
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.190 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the other two
Commissioners

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
agree with that rule or even have been
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
consulted on
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
it would I then press the red button to
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl motion so that a floor

technology and energy committee feel
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
that this new
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
statement of energy policy for our state
 
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
misses the mark in the following
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
Ways by including the
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
phrase to ensure the state's energy
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
Independence this policy ignores the
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
inescapable fact that New Hampshire is
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
actually one of the most dependent
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
states in the country when it comes to
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
energy which leaves our residents and
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
businesses constantly exposed and
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%

or geopolitical changes anywhere in the
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
world at the same time it fails to
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the only energy
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
resources we do have within our
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
Borders or potentially off our
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%

hydropower and wind
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
do contribute substantially to our

state's energy
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
security and
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
affordability in that when they're
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
flowing which is
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
often they displace the need to burn the

often they displace the need to burn the
aforementioned

00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%

substantially every
 
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
day they reduce the regional clearing
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
price of electric electricity and lower

OnDemand and firm
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
resources the policy statement in hp504
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
clearly nods toward large centralized
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
power plants and the 20th century
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
electric grid and it ignores the 21st
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
century Trend toward the proliferation
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics the new statement fails
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that New Hampshire's
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
energy security truly lies in
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%

region look Democrats acknowledge that
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
we'll be burning fossil fuels in New
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a long time none of us
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
want to Outlaw gasoline powered vehicles
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
or fossil fuel burning furn FES or
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
boilers tomorrow or even a decade from
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
now but we do advocate for policies that
 
00:27:06.039 --> 00:27:07.350 align:start position:0%
now but we do advocate for policies that
will

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
slowly over
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
decades as the emergence of new and

energy we can generate here in New
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire HB 504's policy statement is
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
narrow-minded and largely
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
backward-looking so I urge you to vote
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
no on
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
otpa and Mr Speaker I request a division
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
perne thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
last year this body passed a similar
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 1623 on a roll call vote the
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
first part the first part of that bill
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
updated the state energy policy and the
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
second part provided protections for
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
instate electrical generation capacity
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
when that bill reached the other body
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
they removed the energy policy updates
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
and only the generator protections were
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
eventually adopted into state law the
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you now is a slightly
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
improved version of that first part the
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
energy policy
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
update with a little bit of the
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
background out of the way why do we need
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
to update the state energy policy to
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
keep my testimony short I'll give you
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
just a few of the most important changes
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
the existing policy states that we
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
should meet our energy needs at the
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
lowest possible price while providing
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
for reliability and energy diversity but
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
there's no guidance on how to balance
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
those opposing constraints the updated
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
policy explicitly stipulates that market
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
forces market-based mechanisms and
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
customer Choice should drive prudent
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
energy use customer policy states that
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
current policy states that we should
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
maximize the use of Energy Efficiency
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
and other demand side resources the new
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
policy prescribes that we should do
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
those things according to Market
 
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
principles and by focusing on Market
 
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.990 align:start position:0%
principles and by focusing on Market
transformation

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
transformation
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
in cases where there is a significant
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
need for government to intervene in the
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
energy Market the new policy stipulates
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
that any intervention should be quote
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
Tim limited narrow and necessary to
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
achieve a specific policy goal end quote
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the new policy also acknowledges that a
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
significant risk to State energy
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
interest is federal regulations and
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
prescribes a proactive approach whereby
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
state regulatory agencies will
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
collaborate to address Federal
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
concerns in summary the new policy keeps
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
most of the Declarations of the old
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
policy but prescribes Market oriented
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
solution and limits government

committee report of a passes amended on
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%

chair recognized representative Kaplan
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that the current state energy
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
policy and this proposed energy policy
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
share a similar first line calling for
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
Reliable cost effective safe and diverse
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
energy sources but Mr Speaker if I know
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
that this proposed policy adds a second
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
line calling for a specific type of
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
energy resource which makes the first
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
line meaningless because you can't have
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
diverse energy resources while you're
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
calling for a specific type of energy
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
resource Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
new policy also has a third line which
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
calls for us to enhance so-called our
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
state's energy Independence which is not
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
a thing because we are part of a
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
regional new england-wide electricity
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
grid which benefits us with safe
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
reliable cost effective and diverse
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
energy resources for our
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
people Mr Speaker would I not then
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
choose the official state energy policy
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
which is concise reasonable and well
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
balanced and therefore useful over this
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
new policy which is rambling internally
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
contradictory and at times meaningless
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
by a simple push on the red button Mr
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
Speaker would I not then do that yes I
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
would so should
 
00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:56.919 align:start position:0%

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
know that without Dependable
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
energy our economy would falter and fail
 
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.350 align:start position:0%
energy our economy would falter and fail
to

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%

00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
recognized speak to his uh motion thank
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker this is going to be the
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
easiest vote of the day so relax I'm not
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
going to be here very long the amendment
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
is simply to create correct the typo in
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
the bill there was two places where the
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
number was supposed to be changed from
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
33% to 10% we missed one I apologize
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
that corrects that so please vote in
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment the main Bill
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
simply corrects a mistake that's been
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
going on for a number of years we almost
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
completely deregulated landline
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
telephones but we kept charging them the
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
same fee for regulation that they had in
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
the past so there no sense in charging
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
someone for regulation when they're not
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
getting regulated that bill corrects the
 
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
problem so please vote in favor of the
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and then the vote vote for the
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill as Amendment thank
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
bills 682 removes us from the table of
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
any discussion about offshore wind you
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
know when I was in Greece I saw many W
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
wind turbines on the tops of virtually
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
every mountain
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
range how did you get the people to
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
accept wind power I asked our guide he
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
looked at me like I was nuts we respect
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
our people and we respect our land it's
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
free energy why wouldn't we use wind
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
power why wouldn't we
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
indeed we hear a lot of energy bills in
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
our committee and many times that old
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
and clearly debatable axium comes up
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
quote let the free market take care of
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
it however in order for a free market to
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
be free it actually needs to be free one
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
cannot not support the idea of a free
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
market on one hand throttling an
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
Innovative Market on the other hand just
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
because you don't understand it or
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
because it can't be monetized in the
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
same way that fossil fuels
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
can you either believe in a free market
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
or you
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't and while the market is not
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
favorable to Offshore wind right now it
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
is expensive technology changes are
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
being made on an almost daily basis
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
improvements that will enhance
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
performance and lower costs will be
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
coming down the road removing us from
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
this discussion is to put and keep New
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's head into its very Rocky
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
sand also let us not forget that wind
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
power offers an economic stimulus for
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire new industry with good
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
clean energy jobs would be available to
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
our Workforce something that is
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
desperately needed in our
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire's en energy strategy
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
is one of all of the above it's a set of
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
policies that support oil and natural
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
gas and simultaneously every other form
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
of domestic energy including solar wind
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
geothermal and
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
nuclear removing winds circumvents are
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
agreed upon energy policy and
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily restricts what we can use
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
now or in the future this bill hobbles
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
Us in the majority report the
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
environment was raised
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
look not only am I considered a tree
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
hugger but I am old enough to have to
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
have had a save the whales bumper
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
sticker on my VW Beetle in high
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
school I am very concerned about the
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
environment I live in a town where an
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
industrial polluter has poisoned our
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
environment I fight for accountability
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
every day but let's look at the bigger
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
picture the Gulf of Maine has already
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
heated up in fact it has warmed faster
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
than 99% of the global
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
Ocean warmer water res results in
 
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.349 align:start position:0%
Ocean warmer water res results in
ecological

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
ecological
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
change just like we are seeing tropical
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
storms in the Gulf of Mexico become cat
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
for hurricanes in 24 hours excuse me I'm
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
talking how will be in
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
order so are we seeing changes in all
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
large bodies of water like the Gulf of
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
Maine the weather is changing as is the
 
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.950 align:start position:0%
Maine the weather is changing as is the
fish

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
fish
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
population for example lobsters are
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
becoming more suceptible to Shell
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
disease and predatory fish because of
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
War uh predatory fish because of warm
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
water warming waters are also causing
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
lobsters to migrate North and farther
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
offshore to Waters that are
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
colder now let's talk about those whales
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned in the majority
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
report there are ongoing fabricated
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
stories about whales being harmed by
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
wind power we hear it all the time it's
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
kind of like that urban legend about
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
that kid who died from eating Pop
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
Rocks however according to Noah which is
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric ad
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
Administration which is peer-reviewed by
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
the way quote at this point there is no
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence that noise resulting
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
from offshore wind sight
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
characterization surveys could
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
potentially cause wh whale deaths there
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
is no known links between large whale
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
deaths and ongoing offshore wind
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
activities and here's the thing if you
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
are truly concerned about whales then
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
you would do something about climate
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
change the rapid warming of the planet
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
is leading to a loss of habitat for
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
whales and greater competition for a
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
diminishing amount of prey
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
species it is affecting the timing and
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
ranges of their migration their
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
distribution and even their ability to
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
reproduce climate change and our
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
reliance on fossil fuels is only going
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
to accelerate those
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
changes so yes although I no longer have
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
my VW I still believe that we need to
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
save the whales but it is not through
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
stopping wind power it will be through
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
stopping our Reliance on fossil
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
fuels finally let's talk about that
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
executive order that was mentioned in
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
the majority report that eliminates
 
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
the majority report that eliminates
offshore

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
offshore
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
wind to date the current Administration
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
has signed over 65 executive orders many
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
of which are currently being legally
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
challenged with allegations that those
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
orders are
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional exceed presidential
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
Authority and infringe upon the first
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
and Fifth Amendment
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
rights I'm not sure me the member will
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
if a member is requesting a point of
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
order they have to come down the member
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
is requesting a point of order they have
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
to come down to the podium
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
State what their point of order is and
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
is members recognize for point of order
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker so this is my first
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
time being up here so just give you know
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
your point State your point of order
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
point of order is this has nothing to do
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.559 --> 00:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
order

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
well we we unfortunately I don't know
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
what every bill says so I can't say it
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
is or it isn't has to do with something
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
bill member may continue thank you thank
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker as I was saying I'm not
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
sure referencing a current
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
administrative EO right now is the flex
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
that you think it is bottom line when it
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
comes to Offshore wind power New
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be at the table we
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
don't have it now but we will have it
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
someday it's coming keeping us in the
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
wind power discussion is an investment
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire's Energy Future and it
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
is a true example of a free market for
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
these reasons I ask you to oppose the
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
motion of OTP so that a more
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
energy-friendly and job promoting motion
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
request I request a roll call please
 
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
request I request a roll call please
thank

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize your OBS some sit
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
down he has he has not asked not I
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
yet chair recognize don't do that chair
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Summers I'll
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
debate thank you thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
and thank thank you for your leadership
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
after analyzing the European leadership
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
I thank God every day of our freedom of
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
speech we have here in
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
America Mr Speaker HP 682 would remove
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind industry development
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
from the office of energy Innovation it
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
would repeal the offshore wind industry
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce Training Center committee and
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%

if I know that the market-based approach

to energy that we Embrace does not
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
currently favor offshore wind
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
but if I also know that technology
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
changes so that market conditions May
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
someday be favorable to Offshore wind

Speaker Mr Speaker if I I if I know uh I
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
would like to speak about about HB 368 a
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
measure that focuses on a shared
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
priority protecting the health of our
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
children we talk about secondhand smoke
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're not dealing with when we talk
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
about secondhand smoke we're not dealing
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
with speculation or Theory the science
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
is clear the risks are real we know that
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoke contains over 7,000
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
chemicals hundreds of which are toxic
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
and at least 70 known carcinogen
 
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
carcinogens we know that when an adult
 
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
smokes in a confined space like a car
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
the levels of dangerous pollutants can
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
go be up to 10 times higher than in a
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
home we know that a child's lungs still
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
developing and more vulnerable absorb
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
these chemicals at a higher rate
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
exposure to secondhand smoke has been
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
directly linked to higher rates of

and greater susceptibility to disease

later in life but this is not just about
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
traditional cigarettes ecigarettes or

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%

targeted sensible measure to prevent

this is not about politics it's not

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support this bill not
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
because it regulates but because it
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
safeguards not because it limits but
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
because it Shields children from
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
harm that could affect them for the rest

Gori thank you Mr Speaker speaker Mr
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker I stand in support of the
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
committee report of itl of HP
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
368 and I do this for two main reasons
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
number one the flawed premise of the
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill the main premise of this bill is to
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
eliminate smoking in ecigarettes when a
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
passenger is under the age of
 
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
16 however if someone does smoke with a
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
passenger under the age of 16 it is only
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
enforcable under a secondary
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
offense so if a driver
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
decides to obey the rules of the road he
 
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.390 align:start position:0%
decides to obey the rules of the road he
or

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
she can have a passenger under the age
 
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
of 16 and can smoke to their hearts
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
content it defeats the whole premise of
 
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.390 align:start position:0%
content it defeats the whole premise of
the

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
bill secondly it invades a car owner's
 
00:59:15.319 --> 00:59:16.270 align:start position:0%
bill secondly it invades a car owner's
civil

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
civil
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
liberties if this bill is passed it
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
allows the government to tell someone
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
what they can or cannot do in their
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle what What's Next Car Radio is
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
too loud and it hurts their ears maybe
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
you can't drink coffee because it's hot
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
and will spill on your
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
lap the bill is a slippery slope with
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
that I ask you to press the green button
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
and tell the government to stay out of
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%

particularly to Children's Health and
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that a child is often

inquir thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
that changing the percentage of the
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
business profits tax per section
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
77820 that is deposited in the education
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund from 41% to
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
59% would add an estimated $158 million
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
for public education student aid and if
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
I know that this percentage change would
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
not increase the business profits tax
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
rate but would provide for property tax
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
relief by increas in funding for public
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill would not raise
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
any Revenue but instead would just move
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
money from the business profits tax to
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
the more money to the education trust

some or even all of their tax
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
liability the Hampshire now cannot

accurately determine the scope of profit
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%

achieve with complete corporate
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
reporting all companies whether based in
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire or Manchester
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
England would report all of their
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
activities across the
 
01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
globe the New Hampshire tax liability
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
could then be precisely determined by
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
comparing Granite State activity to
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
Global activity finally leveling the
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
competitive playing field for all
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
businesses operating in the
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
hire and while estimates differ every
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
estimate is predicting additional
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue with this change for our state
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
and we believe those additional dollars
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
could go to property tax relief by
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
providing additional support for public
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
schools this bill does not impose a new
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
tax it simply makes foreign
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
multinationals subject to the same rules
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
as every other Enterprise doing business
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
in the granite
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
state now you may hear all sorts of
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
complicated arguments against what is
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
basically a simple
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
idea you may hear that no other state
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
relies on complete corporate reporting
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
also known as worldwide combined
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
reporting but in fact several states do
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
employ versions of it some may worry
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
that no Hampshire will be the first to
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
truly adopt complete corporate reporting
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
but this is the first in the nation
 
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
presidential primary State and this was
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
the first state to adopt a Statewide
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
Lottery the majority report says the
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
commission that studied this issue
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
rejected it 7 to1 but I would point out
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
in that report three
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
members explicitly said they were not
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
taking a position on that
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
issue fundamentally the opposition boils
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
down to this
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
change is too
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
hard but the fact is it's not complete
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
corporate reporting is not even new it
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
push the red button to defeat the
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%

on to support complete corporate
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's just this simple do you stand with
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire businesses or do you stand
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
with foreign
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
multinationals and Mr Speaker I ask for
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker HB 502 represents an
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
effort to revive an obscure business tax
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
methodology that New Hampshire adopted
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
Ed in 1981 and repealed by
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
1986 in a nationwide wave of rejection
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
enjoying an ultra short lifespan 40
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
years ago HB 502 would require any
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
multinational entity as a condition of
 
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire to
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
declare all of its worldwide income no
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
matter where earned to the New Hampshire
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and then apply
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
apportionment formulas to determine how
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
much of of it is attributable to New
 
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire an essentially identical
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
proposition was the subject of a
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
2022-23 statutory commission which I
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
chaired and uh that commission
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
recommended 7 to one against adop reopt
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
no worldwide combined reporting this
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
body rejected a similar bill just last
 
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
year since the federal government
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
mandates separate entity reporting with
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
so-called arms length adjust ments HB
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
502 would require a magnitude greater
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
information to be filed in New Hampshire
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
over what the
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
IRS or any other state requires creating
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
a significant disincentive to doing
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
business in New
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this would be particularly Odd
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
as the takeoff point for a fi for filing
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
a business tax return in New Hampshire
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
is the net uh taxable income on the
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
federal return thus a multinational
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
business filing in New Hampshire would
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
have to deal with an array of
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
disclosures and hurdles to modify or
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
adjust net Federal taxable
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
income the Bill's sponsors seem to be
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
under the delusion that this is a simple
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward matter of adding up
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
their known and declared earnings
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
obtained in every other
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
country but net taxable incomes as
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
declared in other countries may have
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
little relationship to
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
ours as countries vary greatly in their
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
accounting conventions reporting
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
requirements tax schemes and rules not
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
to mention languages and currencies
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with New Hampshire's
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
requirements would demand enormous time
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
and effort to adjust for Conformity with
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
rules regarding what is taxable as well
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
as what deductions disallowances or
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
credits may be
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
allowable a new burden would also fall
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
onto the Dr staff requiring in their
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
words quote more of everything close
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
quote more forms reviews audits travel
 
01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:29.590 align:start position:0%
quote more forms reviews audits travel
and

01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement the sponsors presume that
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
this requirement will inevitably bring
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
greater business tax revenue to New
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's coffers but in fact it's not
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
obvious that it will increase New
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire revenues some filers will owe
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
more some will owe less according to how
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
they did elsewhere in the world so there
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
will be winners and losers amongst tax
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
filers and those that are losers this
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
Year may be winners next year and nobody
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
can guess whether New Hampshire's
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
business revenues will be the winner in
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
any given year determining a business's
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
liability for tax on profits earned in
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by measuring it everywhere
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
else is a convoluted approach that would
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
not provide the benefits the sponsors
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
imagin and might even result in reduced
 
01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue in New Hampshire all while
 
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:23.960 align:start position:0%

false reporting the consequences of

false reporting are profound false
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
accusations can destroy lives damage

criminal liability consequences for

reports in order to weaponize the system

estimate that between 30 and 50% of

child abuse claims in high conflict
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%

with their child being falsely accused
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%

prosecution resulting in jail time most
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
disturbing is that the damaging effects
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
of false allegations on children can
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
that can last a lifetime potentially
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
each time a report is filed the child
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
may have to undergo unnecessary and
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes very intrusive medical exams
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
physical evaluations may be performed
 
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
and the child May undergo repeated

disgruntled former employees and

sometimes former clients an
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
investigation into the alleged abuse can
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
bring severe legal and financial
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
consequences for the child care provider
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
the child care provider may be suspended

conducted child care providers rely
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
heavily on the reputation and Trust
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
within the community to continue their
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
work false accusations can severely
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
damage this trust the immediate
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
suspension or termination of the
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
provider from their position can lead to
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
disruption in the care of the children
 
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
this disruption can create emotional
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
instability and confusion for children
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
and can have a significant negative
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
impact on the parents if as they have to
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
find Alternative Care or Miss days of
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
work resulting in loss wages or putting
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
their employment in
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy I actually have had experience
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
with this nightmare so I know all of the
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
above to be true one one evening I
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
received a phone call telling me that
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
our home daycare was being investigated
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
for child abuse this woman had lovingly
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
cared for three children in our extended
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
family over the years and I was shocked
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
I told the case worker that I was sure
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
there has to has to be a mistake that
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
our Sharon was a wonderful mother and
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
her younger youngest son was 17 years
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
old I was confused the worker next said
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
no Mrs Nelson she is accused of abusing
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
children and her home daycare including
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
your daughter and you will have to
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
immediately find Alternative Care until
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
our invest investigation is
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
completed well the case was investigated
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
and closed in a timely manner a new
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
neighbor who didn't like the sound of
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
children playing next door
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
filed a false report in the hopes that
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
the children would go away as a result
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
accusation saying that was an extremely
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
difficult time is an
 
01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
understatement the US Department of
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services states that
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
studies estimate that approximately 1%
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
to 8% of all reports to CPS are
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
malicious or false so if we meet
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the middle and use 4% that
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
means that potentially there are 800
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
malicious reports a year here in New
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that divert resources from
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate cases where children are
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
truly at risk that that overburden
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
social workers who may be forced to
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
follow through with extensive
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
investigations this takes time and can
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
lead to delays in investigating real
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
child welfare cases false reporting can
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
also result in court cases which require
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
time and money if a false report leads
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
to legal proceedings this can waste
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
public resources and further B burden
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
our Judicial System the majority of US
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
states have penalties for malicious
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
reporting of child abuse in Florida
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
making a false report is classified as a
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
third degree felony which can result in
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
penalties including fines and up to 5
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
years in prison in Michigan penalties
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
for false reporting may include
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
significant fines and imprisonment
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
particularly if the report results in
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
harm to the person being falsely accused
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
in California the laws for the law
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
allows for a fine of up to $1,000 in
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
potential jail time for individuals to
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
file a false report with the intention
 
01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
of causing harm or
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
disruption we heard in testimony that
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
implementing these penalties will
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
prevent callers from wanting to report
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
actual abuse when asked for data from
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
other states that have implemented
 
01:29:42.189 --> 01:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
penalties showing uh
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
sorry when asked for data from other
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented penalties
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
showing a decrease in reporting that
 
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
information couldn't be provided to the
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee since no state that that has
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
implemented laws regarding false
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
reporting has repealed those laws I
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
think that's proof that that's not a
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
problem and speaking of California
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
governor Newsome signed a bill into law
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
that became effective last month to
 
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
further efforts to cut down on false
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
reports states are making more laws
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
regarding this not less lastly even
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
though our committee does great
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work there are a few bills
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
that we disc agree on and obviously this
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
is one of
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
them interestingly in many other states
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
there's a bipartisan effort to clamp
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
down on false
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
reporting like California Utah and New
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
York please join these states and others
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
to protect innocent individuals families
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
and businesses and make sure that every
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
child's well-being remains a priority
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
and press the red button so another
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
patrio thank you Mr
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker this legislation has very good
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
intentions it seeks to prevent false and
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
malicious reports about child abuse and
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
neglect of
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
DCF however there are two big
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
problems first those who seek to make
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
such reports May continue to be
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
anonymous with the call center never
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
knowing who who actually made the false
 
01:31:27.109 --> 01:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
report in the first
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
place secondly and more
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
importantly the call center May inform
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
the caller that false reports may bring
 
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
about civil and criminal penalties that
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
alone may be enough to make good faith
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
repor is hesitant second guessing
 
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
themselves and not file a legitimate
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
report putting a child at risk and if
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
one child is put at risk that's one
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
child too many so while the bill has
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
good intentions it's impractical and
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful so I urge you to
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
vote with the majority of the children
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
and family law committee where we put
 
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
the safety and the welfare of Children
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
First above all else and I ask you to
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
vote itl Mr Speaker I request a division
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
much division a division has been
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us majority commit a
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
report of inexpedient to legislate on
 
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 243 this is a division vote
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative D
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
if I know that this will not prevent
 
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
anybody from calling
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
anonymously but it will allow the intake
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
people to recognize voices and phone
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
if I also know that according to the
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
parents rights Foundation National
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
statistics 83% of child abuse and
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
neglect cases are
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
false reports in states with penalties
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
or false reports it is 96% in the states
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
where there is no penalty against false
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
reporters the difference of 2600
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
calls or report courts that could delay
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
saving a true
 
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
victim where there were about 20,000
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
calls made to dcyf right here in New
 
01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.310 align:start position:0%
calls made to dcyf right here in New
Hampshire

01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
10,000 are weeded out and less than a
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
thousand actually go to
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
court the concern May if I know that one
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
concern is the fear of good callers will
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
avoid calling I think I debunked that in
 
01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.310 align:start position:0%
avoid calling I think I debunked that in
my

01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
first finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
false reports harm not only the parents
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
but more the children and that's a
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
concern of DCF and children and family
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
law that I have heard time and time and
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
time again in my 17 years of serving so
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I ask that everybody vote red
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
soone I'll alternative motion can be
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%

successfully enacted such um legislation
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
do not have Anonymous reporting and if I
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
also understand that if I was doing
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
something for nefarious purposes I would
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
certainly not be giving my name and if I
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
further understand that this bill does
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
not compel nor mandate someone to give
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
their name rendering this an
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful way to handle this would I
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%

Muse thank you Mr
 
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker in this body most of us aren't
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
shy when it comes to using our
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority to support victims
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
while we may have our differences
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
victims of violent crime and domestic
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
abuse have many friends in this
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
legislature but there are two sets of
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
victims that far too many of us prefer
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
not to think about or not to see these
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
are the victims of gun violence and
 
01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
Firearm suicide in our
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
state today I come before you to ask for
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
your help and passing a common sense
 
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
Public Safety bill that would change
 
01:39:24.109 --> 01:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
this by doing two things first first
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
hp56 at long last would Implement a
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
universal firearms background check
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
process for our state and secondly it
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
would establish a minimum 72-hour
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
waiting period before a Firearms
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
transfer can take
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
place the bill has two main goals the
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
first is to reduce the risk of firearms
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
from falling into the hands of felons
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
protective order violators domestic
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
abusers and people whose severe mental
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
illness makes them fed ineligible to
 
01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.870 align:start position:0%
illness makes them fed ineligible to
purchase

01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
firearms the second goal is to help
 
01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
reduce gun homicides and suicides in our
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
state by creating a 72-hour buffer of
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
time that can help people who are in
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
crisis or who are considering suicide or
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
an impulsive act of
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
violence currently in New Hampshire a
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
firearms background check is only
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
required when a Firearms purchase is
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
made from a federally licensed dealer
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
while it's a felony in New hampsh ampure
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
to sell or transfer a firearm to a
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
convicted felon enforcing this
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
prohibition is a challenge because of a
 
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
critical loophole in our state we don't
 
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
require background checks for Private
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
Sales that don't involve a licensed
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
dealer this loophole creates a dangerous
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
loophole in our law it not only makes it
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
easier for a convicted felon to to
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
obtain a firearm but it also makes it
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
easier for domestic abusers and other
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
people that our laws have already
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
determined pose a public safety risk
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
high enough to prohibit them from owning
 
01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.430 align:start position:0%
high enough to prohibit them from owning
a

01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
firearm under the bill transfers between
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
private parties will be facilitated by a
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
federally licensed firearm dealer at
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
their place of business the role of the
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
dealer will be to initiate the
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
background process background check
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
process to notify the parties of the
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
result and if the background check
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
clears to complete the transfer between
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
the two parties unlike past attempts to
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
pass a bill like this this bill does not
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
try to parse the difference between a
 
01:41:31.229 --> 01:41:31.239 align:start position:0%
commercial sale and a private sale with
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
a handful of sensible objections this
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill simply requires a background check
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
facilitated by a federally Firearms uh
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
by a federally licensed Firearms dealer
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
for the transfer of ownership of a
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
firearm where neither party is a
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
dealer also in response to feedback from
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
gun owners this Bill does carve out
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
sensible OB uh exemptions for certain
 
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
types of transfers among them are gifts
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
and inheritances between immediate
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
family members as well as temporary
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
transfers between hunters and Target
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
Shooters who simply want to try out
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
another Shooters weapon another key part
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill is a minimum 72-hour waiting
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
period between the time a background
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
check is initiated and the transfer of
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
the firearm to the new owner currently
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
there is no waiting period period and a
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
weapon can be transferred as soon as a
 
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
background check clears under this bill
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
the waiting period would start
 
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
immediately after the initiation of the
 
01:42:35.229 --> 01:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
background check by the dealer if the
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
background check clears the waiting
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
period would expire after 72 hours after
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
the process was first initiated by the
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
dealer to be clear no transfer could
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
take place until the background check
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
clears even if it takes more than 72
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
hours for people in crisis a brief
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory waiting period can mean the
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
difference between life and death during
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearing we H we heard from a
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
hookset mother who lost her 21-year-old
 
01:43:07.709 --> 01:43:07.719 align:start position:0%
son to Suicide with a firearm he had
 
01:43:07.719 --> 01:43:08.950 align:start position:0%
son to Suicide with a firearm he had
just

01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
purchased we also heard testimony from
 
01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Psychiatric Society
 
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
that suicide attempts are often
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
impulsive singular tragedies that
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
because of the damage a bullet can do a
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt with a firearm is often
 
01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt with a firearm is often
90%

01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
90%
 
01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
successful while there are admittedly
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
other ways you can take your own life a
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt with a firearm is almost
 
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
always fatal waiting periods can give
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
people additional time they need to get
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
help or to think through their
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
actions Donna Moren the mom who
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
testified before our committee told us
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
that a waiting period period may have
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
very well saved her son's life in a
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
similar way Studies have also shown that
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
the kind of short-lived anger and rage
 
01:44:03.149 --> 01:44:03.159 align:start position:0%
that might lead a person to purchase a
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
weapon to harm another person can
 
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
actually dissipate over a fairly short
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
period of
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
time waiting periods provide a cooling
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
off period for people who might harm
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
themselves or who might harm others
 
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
Universal background checks can help
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk of firearms from falling
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
into the hands of people that are laws
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
for very good reason already prohibit
 
01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
from purchasing or possessing firearms
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
so Mr Speaker for these reasons I urge
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
you to vote against the itl M motion so
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker I know many of you might be
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
thinking it seems like we're going to
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of the bills again today
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
they've been all resurrected and you're
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
right but this one is different I'm
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to tell you
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
why we keep on hearing that this is
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
about suicide prevention but when asked
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
in the committee about a woman that
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
maybe is the victim of domestic violence
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
why would there not be an exception for
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
her if she wanted to go purchase a
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
firearm because that exception was in
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
their last year we were told Well
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
because most likely she's not trained
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
and doesn't know how to use the firearm
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
properly I'm certain that we don't have
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
a law that says you have to be trained
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
we probably should be careful cuz that
 
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
will be next but we'll kill that one too
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker don't
 
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
worry we also heard that there's not an
 
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
exception for anybody that might be a
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
hunter or somebody that might already
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
own one firearm or 100 Firearms so not
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
really sure the reason for the waiting
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
period especially waiting 72 hours after
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
your criminal background check has
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
already come back
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
we keep on being told this is about
 
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.310 align:start position:0%
we keep on being told this is about
suicide

01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
prevention but the very people that are
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill telling us this is
 
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
about suicide prevention are voting for
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
an assisted suicide Bill make that make
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
sense it seems to me if this was really
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
about suicide
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
prevention we would have the reasonable
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
exceptions that should be in here even
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
though those were killed I I I'll be it
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
those were killed last year as well but
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
it seems given all the talk about one
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
thing but nothing that actually shows
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
that what's it about I would have to say
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
control represent of grer has requested
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
a roll call is that sufficiently
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
committee report of in expedient to
 
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
legislated on House Bill 56 this is a
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
roll call vote chair recognizes
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
that keeping deadly weapons out of the
 
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
hands of more felons and domestic
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
abusers is one of the most meaningful
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
things we can do to protect Public
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
Safety and if I know that a short
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
cooling off period between the time a
 
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
weapon is purchased and the time a new
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
owner takes delivery will save lives and
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that while there are many
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
things from housing to child care to
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services that our state
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
could use more of two things we
 
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely could use less of are victims
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
of gun violence and victims of gun
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
suicide then would I press the red
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
button so another motion may be made
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognize representative
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
if I know that saying one thing but
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
reading the words on the piece of paper
 
01:48:39.629 --> 01:48:39.639 align:start position:0%
say two different stories and if I know
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
that Maine has just overturned their

overwhelming majority of granite Staters
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
who implore this body to end the

criminalization of cannabis to end the
 
03:03:29.670 --> 03:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
fear of unnecessary disruption to
 
03:03:32.510 --> 03:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
people's lives in the event that they
 
03:03:34.510 --> 03:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
find Cannabis to be their nighttime
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%

03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
up I stand before you as a person who
 
03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
has been humbled by life circumstances
 
03:03:48.910 --> 03:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is the tragic
 
03:03:52.590 --> 03:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
loss of my fiance to heroin
 
03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
overdose but also my big brother and my
 
03:03:59.469 --> 03:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
best friend in the whole world to
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
alcoholism these substances kill our
 
03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:03.389 align:start position:0%
alcoholism these substances kill our
loved

03:04:03.389 --> 03:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
loved
 
03:04:06.990 --> 03:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
ones yet the latter is perfectly legal
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
We Trust our citizens over the age of 21
 
03:04:11.790 --> 03:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
to consume alcohol responsibly and
 
03:04:15.550 --> 03:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
rightly so but somehow we still maintain
 
03:04:18.030 --> 03:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
that our citizens cannot be trusted to
 
03:04:19.590 --> 03:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
consume cannabis
 
03:04:22.590 --> 03:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
responsibly even as we know that it is
 
03:04:25.349 --> 03:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible to consume a lethal
 
03:04:29.349 --> 03:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
amount and even as we know that cannabis
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
is a much safer alternative to the
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
substances that have taken the lives of
 
03:04:37.070 --> 03:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
my loved ones and likely many of
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
yours so here I stand asking you once
 
03:04:44.110 --> 03:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
again to pass legislation that would
 
03:04:47.110 --> 03:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
entrust our citizens over the age of 21
 
03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
with the resp responsibility to consume
 
03:04:51.910 --> 03:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis if they so choose without fear
 
03:04:54.429 --> 03:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
of Retribution from the state and who
 
03:04:56.590 --> 03:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
knows we may just save some lives while
 
03:05:04.150 --> 03:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:09.309 --> 03:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:13.190 --> 03:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if
 
03:05:17.110 --> 03:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
we decide to legalize marijuana then we
 
03:05:19.710 --> 03:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
should do it correctly um in an orderly
 
03:05:22.950 --> 03:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
way I mean I know we've tried in 50
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
different bills over the last few years
 
03:05:28.269 --> 03:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
nothing seems to go through and let me
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
tell you this one ain't going to go
 
03:05:30.990 --> 03:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
through either we know it's not going to
 
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
get all the way through so let's do it
 
03:05:35.229 --> 03:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
smart and do something that takes care
 
03:05:36.990 --> 03:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
of children and has guard rails and
 
03:05:38.670 --> 03:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
protections not just throw it out there
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do it do it right no
 
03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
state that have done it so far has just
 
03:05:44.229 --> 03:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
thrown it open and said here you go
 
03:05:46.349 --> 03:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
there's guard rails we need to at least
 
03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
have some guard rails and while I
 
03:05:50.550 --> 03:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
understand the theem motion of trying to
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
get something through and it can't seem
 
03:05:54.110 --> 03:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
to go through the answer is not to just
 
03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
throw something out there and hope it
 
03:05:57.309 --> 03:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
passes if we do it it's got to be done
 
03:05:59.830 --> 03:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
responsibly our constituents expect it
 
03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
to be done responsibly not just for us
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
to throw up our hands and say fine
 
03:06:06.309 --> 03:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
everybody have some part so vote your
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%

be a little bit more
 
03:06:11.750 --> 03:06:11.760 align:start position:0%

03:07:38.190 --> 03:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
if I know that Granite Staters have
 
03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
asked us again and again to legalize
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis in the state and if I know that
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
previous attempts to legalize
 
03:07:49.150 --> 03:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis have been too
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
complicated to get full approval of this
 
03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
body but this bill did pass unanimous or
 
03:07:56.110 --> 03:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
not unanimously but pass by a majority
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
of this house last year and if I further
 
03:08:00.349 --> 03:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
know that cannabis is easily accessible
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
in every single state around us and
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
therefore impossible for us to prevent
 
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
its presence in our communities and Mr
 
03:08:08.590 --> 03:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this means we are
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
arresting and criminalizing our
 
03:08:12.750 --> 03:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
constituents unjustly for participating
 
03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
in activities that should be legal would
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
I now press the red button to defeat the
 
03:08:19.950 --> 03:08:19.960 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:14:30.070 --> 03:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
if I know that the blackjacks slung
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
shots and metallic Knuckles are weapons
 
03:14:34.110 --> 03:14:34.120 align:start position:0%

03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
they often associated with criminal
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
activities such as gang fights or

robberies and their very presence
 
03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
typically leads to more violent
 
03:14:53.309 --> 03:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
confrontations that would have occurred
 
03:14:57.229 --> 03:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
without them and lastly if the minority
 
03:15:00.590 --> 03:15:00.600 align:start position:0%

03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
place to protect the public and lifting
 
03:15:06.510 --> 03:15:06.520 align:start position:0%

Hampshire to have certain substances
 
03:15:40.950 --> 03:15:40.960 align:start position:0%

having considered the same being unable
 
03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
to agree with the majority Report with
 
03:22:41.110 --> 03:22:41.120 align:start position:0%

03:22:53.469 --> 03:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I rise
 
03:22:55.510 --> 03:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
today to oppose the inexpedient to
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
legislate recommendation on HB
 
03:23:00.590 --> 03:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
352 on days when federal state or
 
03:23:02.750 --> 03:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections are taking place
 
03:23:04.229 --> 03:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit carrying a
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon either out in the open or
 
03:23:09.070 --> 03:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
concealed within 100 ft of a polling
 
03:23:11.309 --> 03:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
place the goal of the bill is pretty
 
03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
simple to reduce the risk of our
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
citizens and our election workers from
 
03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
being implicit l or explicitly
 
03:23:20.309 --> 03:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
threatened with guns while taking part
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the most sacred of American
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
traditions sadly intimidation including
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
intimidation by armed civilians has long
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
been a tool that some have used to
 
03:23:33.469 --> 03:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
prevent full participation in American
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
democracy during and after
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
reconstruction guns were often used to
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
scare black voters away from the
 
03:23:43.590 --> 03:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
polls as our country becomes more
 
03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
divided our sad and shame ful history of
 
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
armed voter intimidation and political
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
violence is being repeated during recent
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
election Cycles people have been
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
arrested for making death threats to
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
election workers and for setting fire to
 
03:24:02.830 --> 03:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
vote dropboxes in Georgia and Michigan
 
03:24:05.550 --> 03:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
during the 2020 election voters and
 
03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
election workers faced intimidation and
 
03:24:10.030 --> 03:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
threats of violence in Charlotte North
 
03:24:12.150 --> 03:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
Carolina an armed man was arrested after
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
a polling supervisor asked him to leave
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
a polling place on Election Day and he
 
03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
turn in Lane County Oregon armed
 
03:24:21.710 --> 03:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
individuals reportedly approached people
 
03:24:23.590 --> 03:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
as they were dropping off their
 
03:24:25.950 --> 03:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
ballots while these incidents are
 
03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
admittedly rare in New Hampshire it's
 
03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
simply inaccurate to say that acts of
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
intimidation involving guns at polling
 
03:24:36.429 --> 03:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
places don't happen in Manchester during
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
the November 2020 election an armed man
 
03:24:40.429 --> 03:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
harassed people holding signs for
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
candidates in the election earing area
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
outside of three separate polling places
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
Behavior like this not only puts voters
 
03:24:51.870 --> 03:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
and election workers at risk it puts
 
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
democracy itself at risk 22 states in
 
03:24:58.349 --> 03:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
the district of Colombia already
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
explicitly prohibit guns at polling
 
03:25:03.790 --> 03:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
places in some way unfortunately our
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
state does not under our current law
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
state and local authorities can't
 
03:25:10.750 --> 03:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
prevent people from bringing guns into
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
polling places even those located in
 
03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:14.710 align:start position:0%

school
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
buildings with HB 352 we have the power
 
03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
to fix this and we have the
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional authority to do so in the
 
03:25:26.189 --> 03:25:26.199 align:start position:0%

03:25:27.710 --> 03:25:27.720 align:start position:0%

03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
that nothing in our opinion should be
 
03:25:39.030 --> 03:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
taken to cast doubt on long-standing

03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
further provides that no Battalion or
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
company can come within a mile of a
 
03:26:27.630 --> 03:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
polling place for 24 hours before or
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
after an
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
election the same year Maryland passed
 
03:26:34.750 --> 03:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
an identical law New York followed suit
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh a decade later and more states have
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
added similar laws during Reconstruction
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
and also in the 20th century the bottom
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
line is this is not an anti-gun law as
 
03:26:46.349 --> 03:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
some would frame it what it is is a a
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
Prov voter law that will reduce the risk
 
03:26:50.670 --> 03:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
of armed intimidation from happening in
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
a place where it should never happen as
 
03:26:55.990 --> 03:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the argument that bringing weapons
 
03:26:58.750 --> 03:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
is necessary for self-defense there is
 
03:27:01.990 --> 03:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
no record that I can find anywhere of a
 
03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
good guy with a gun ever springing to
 
03:27:05.790 --> 03:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
his own defense or to the defense of
 
03:27:07.710 --> 03:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
others during a shooting inside a
 
03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
polling place the bottom line is
 
03:27:12.550 --> 03:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
bringing guns into a polling place does
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
nothing to promote election security or
 
03:27:18.389 --> 03:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
to make anyone safer but what it does do
 
03:27:21.910 --> 03:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
is intimidate lawful voters and risks
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
Bloodshed I ask you to vote red so
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%

remembering um the the sad history of of
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
our country and he is correct is said
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
and when my party fought a war to end
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
slavery we ensured that everyone had
 
03:27:54.189 --> 03:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
their second amendment rights still it
 
03:27:56.429 --> 03:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
was the clan that tried to keep
 
03:27:57.790 --> 03:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
African-Americans in the south from
 
03:28:00.349 --> 03:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
owning firearms and it seems today it
 
03:28:03.870 --> 03:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't stopped we encourage everyone
 
03:28:06.309 --> 03:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of their Creed Color Race to
 
03:28:08.030 --> 03:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
arm themselves and protect themselves
 
03:28:10.590 --> 03:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
and defend themselves whether it's a
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
polling place or any other place I heard
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
him say I didn't hear one case of a good
 
03:28:16.269 --> 03:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
guy with a gun well I haven't seen the
 
03:28:17.550 --> 03:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
case of a bad guy with a gun at a
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
polling place in New Hampshire so I
 
03:28:20.990 --> 03:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't care what other states did New
 
03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is doing what New Hampshire
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
does and we are not going to limit the
 
03:28:26.110 --> 03:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
rights of our citizens to defend
 
03:28:27.550 --> 03:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
themselves in polling places or any
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%

parliamentary
 
03:29:45.590 --> 03:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
03:29:47.550 --> 03:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
so find I know that polling places here
 
03:29:50.790 --> 03:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are safe but if I also
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
know that our polling places will be
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
even safer if we pass HB
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
352 if I know this bill protects the
 
03:30:00.910 --> 03:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
right of all voters including those who
 
03:30:03.630 --> 03:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
do don't own any guns at all which is a
 
03:30:06.429 --> 03:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
actually about two-thirds of the
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
population it's true um if I know that
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
22 States already have laws guaranteeing
 
03:30:14.229 --> 03:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
safe folding places including four of
 
03:30:16.229 --> 03:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
the five states which border the Gulf of
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
Mexico and perhaps closer to
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
home the house will be in
 
03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
order closer to home the other two
 
03:30:28.510 --> 03:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
states which border the Gulf of Maine
 
03:30:30.269 --> 03:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
that's probably what we care about more
 
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
but regardless of whether your state
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
borders the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of
 
03:30:39.790 --> 03:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
Maine or any Gulf at all um I know that
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is a simple Common Sense Bill we
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
should have this in the granite
 
03:30:46.750 --> 03:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
state so should I to make our poing
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
places even safer so would I then press
 
03:30:52.830 --> 03:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
the red button so we can overturn the
 
03:30:55.710 --> 03:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
itl and consider a more sensible motion
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
such as perhaps ought to pass anyway
 
03:31:00.030 --> 03:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
first thing to do press red to overturn
 
03:31:03.229 --> 03:31:03.239 align:start position:0%

Sher thank you Mr thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
um appreciate that I'm a recovering law
 
03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
professor so I could talk to you about
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce clause I could
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
talk to you about the latent Commerce
 
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
Clause I could talk to you about
 
03:33:57.309 --> 03:33:57.319 align:start position:0%
whether a bill a a a gun that's
 
03:33:59.710 --> 03:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
manufactured in New Hampshire is
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
manufactured with uh pieces material
 
03:34:06.309 --> 03:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
that came from out of state and whether
 
03:34:09.950 --> 03:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
that incl that makes it an interstate uh
 
03:34:12.189 --> 03:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
item uh in spite of the fact that it's
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Hampshire but uh because
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to recover from being a
 
03:34:17.670 --> 03:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
lesser I'm not going to talk to you
 
03:34:20.070 --> 03:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
about that uh what this bill is really
 
03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
about is to set up
 
03:34:25.389 --> 03:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
litigation uh on the issue of uh the
 
03:34:27.870 --> 03:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause and its
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
applicability uh I understand that that
 
03:34:33.670 --> 03:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
litigation my my problem the problem
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
with this bill is it wants the state to
 
03:34:39.790 --> 03:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
fund the litigation Private Industry
 
03:34:39.800 --> 03:34:41.229 align:start position:0%
fund the litigation Private Industry
entities

03:34:41.229 --> 03:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
entities
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
could fund this litigation but they want
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
to pass on that they want the state the
 
03:34:49.750 --> 03:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to spend their
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh money uh an underresourced office
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%

03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker this is
 
03:35:21.870 --> 03:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
an interesting bill this is a bill that
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
was brought to us on the premise
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the United States Supreme Court in
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
the early 40s decided um that the use of
 
03:35:34.750 --> 03:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Clause could expand the
 
03:35:36.510 --> 03:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
federal government's authority to
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
regulate just about everything we own
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
and do and it's been continuing that way
 
03:35:43.389 --> 03:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
for so long and we believe that it's
 
03:35:44.910 --> 03:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
high time that the court take a second
 
03:35:46.349 --> 03:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
look at it like it's stun with other
 
03:35:49.189 --> 03:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
cases recently and decide again whether
 
03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
or not the founders intended for the
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
United States Congress and its law
 
03:35:55.630 --> 03:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies to exert their
 
03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
authority over every state in the
 
03:35:59.870 --> 03:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
country and how we decide to do business
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
so we agree with that this bill should
 
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
be brought forward for that purpose and
 
03:36:06.670 --> 03:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
um we ask you to support the committee
 
03:36:06.680 --> 03:36:08.990 align:start position:0%

03:37:28.750 --> 03:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:37:31.229 --> 03:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the sponsor of
 
03:37:33.550 --> 03:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
the bill testified that the sole purpose
 
03:37:36.670 --> 03:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to elicit a challenge in
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
the federal courts under the supremacy
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
clause and then he later on he in his
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
testimony he threw in the commer Clause
 
03:37:46.030 --> 03:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
because that's really what he's trying
 
03:37:48.910 --> 03:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
to attack and part of the Comm Clause is
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
the National Firearms
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
Act if I know this bill attempts to
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
succeed this challenge by restricting
 
03:37:58.349 --> 03:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
the use of certain Firearms to the
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
confines of New Hampshire even though
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has repeatedly found
 
03:38:06.389 --> 03:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
that regulating Firearms is
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional even when that firearm
 
03:38:11.910 --> 03:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
activity occurs wholly within a single
 
03:38:14.670 --> 03:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
state and if I know this bill will not
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
only diminish Public Safety but it will
 
03:38:20.670 --> 03:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
put a heavy burden on the New Hampshire
 
03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general if he chooses to pursue
 
03:38:25.950 --> 03:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
this challenge would I now push the red
 
03:38:28.830 --> 03:38:28.840 align:start position:0%

03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%

to the public are
 
03:45:42.389 --> 03:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
important but must be done carefully and

with respect to individual privacy

concerns

concerns
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
much of the information required in hp76
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
is duplicative and already posted on the
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education website with
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
redacted there is also an analysis of
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
Trends and data relative to the 2024
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
complaints moreover some of the required
 
03:46:10.950 --> 03:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
types of data listed in
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
hb76 lack context and could easily be
 
03:46:18.750 --> 03:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted for example it requires
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to publicly
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
identify individual school
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
districts this raises serious student
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns as there are typically
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
less than 40 cases in the State per year
 
03:46:37.149 --> 03:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
if there is only one complaint in a
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
school district it is quite likely that
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
a student's identity could be
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:49.870 --> 03:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
hb76 is intended to provide a Statewide
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
guide to how the federal IGA law should
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
be interpreted but it overshoots that
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
Mark and could compromise the privacy of
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
both School personnel and individual
 
03:47:05.550 --> 03:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
students legislation has already been
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
passed to give the office of the
 
03:47:10.590 --> 03:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
advocate for special education access to
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
all relevant data to better assist with
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
parent complaints
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
and The Advocate is the one best
 
03:47:19.710 --> 03:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
equipped to handle such sensitive
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
information involving parent
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
complaints there is no need to publicly
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
post all of this
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
data I urge you to protect our students
 
03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
privacy and vote no on the out to pass
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
motion Mr Speaker I ask for a division

colleagues I speak today in support of

special education
 
03:47:57.389 --> 03:47:57.399 align:start position:0%
complaints colleagues this bill merely
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
increases transparency while ensuring
 
03:48:03.349 --> 03:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
privacy on data the doe currently
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
collects it does not Place undue
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
hardship on the doe or create additional
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
work it does not infringe on the
 
03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
protection of personally identifiable
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%

03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill have stated in small school
 
03:48:29.550 --> 03:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
districts children will be easily
 
03:48:32.110 --> 03:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
identified the notion that this bill
 
03:48:34.550 --> 03:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
exposes a child with a documented
 
03:48:37.389 --> 03:48:37.399 align:start position:0%
disability is not only unfounded but a
 
03:48:40.429 --> 03:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
spasmodic response given the amount of
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
complaints received by legislators
 
03:48:42.479 --> 03:48:43.429 align:start position:0%

around
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
transparency this Bill merely seeks to
 
03:48:49.710 --> 03:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
address that issue in a timely secure
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%

03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:50:04.670 --> 03:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill duplicates work that has
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
already been done and is presently
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
available on the Department of Education
 
03:50:11.469 --> 03:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
website and if I know that this bill
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
tracks special education complaints but
 
03:50:16.229 --> 03:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
does nothing to address them or follow
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
through on a complaint and if I know
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
that in a small District it would be
 
03:50:22.990 --> 03:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
easy to identify who made the complaint
 
03:50:25.590 --> 03:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire student privacy is a
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
priority and strictly protected it is
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
not the kind of transparency that we are
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
looking for would I now press the red
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%

03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%

if I know geography and if I also know
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education has
 
03:50:52.349 --> 03:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
started posting complaint findings as a
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
results of an audit last year but if I
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
know that more information should be
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
available such as the law firms involved
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the due process hearings wouldn't it
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
be interesting to see what law firms are
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
working against parents and if I know
 
03:51:10.389 --> 03:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
that this bill is about transparency for
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
due process hearings where parents are
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%

longstanding requirement that political

techniques of manipulation and
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%

create a study committee to evaluate
 
03:58:30.349 --> 03:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
oyster farming in the Great Bay the
 
03:58:32.229 --> 03:58:32.239 align:start position:0%

Butters over the years 95% of the
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
oysters in the Great Bay have been lost
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's cost the Great Bay one of its
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
most valuable sources of filtration one
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
oyster can filter 40 to 50 gallons per
 
03:58:56.349 --> 03:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
day so it adds up pretty quickly oysters
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
could filter the entire grape Bay in
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
about 4
 
03:59:02.149 --> 03:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
days a thriving oyster farming industry
 
03:59:04.710 --> 03:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
will also have economic benefits for the
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
state as a huge Jimmy Buffett
 
03:59:11.309 --> 03:59:11.319 align:start position:0%

03:59:38.149 --> 03:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
Speaker as the other speaker said this
 
03:59:39.710 --> 03:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
is a very simple bill it's looking for a
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
study committee unfortunately the study
 
03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be
 
03:59:45.750 --> 03:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
done our committee took a field trip out
 
03:59:49.149 --> 03:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
to Great Bay and little Bay last term
 
03:59:52.149 --> 03:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
and we got to see many currently
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
functioning oyster farms on those bodies
 
03:59:57.149 --> 03:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
there are between 11 and 14 different
 
03:59:58.990 --> 03:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
businesses right now doing the oyster
 
04:00:02.189 --> 04:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
farming on Great Bay and little Bay and
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
they have allocated property through the
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
current proper channels that they can
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
now continue seeding and and farming in
 
04:00:11.590 --> 04:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
they've never asked for any more to be
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
allocated yet nor have any new people
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
asked asking to be able to farm there
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
been denied the opportunity to farm
 
04:00:20.189 --> 04:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
there so there's nothing broken in the
 
04:00:23.309 --> 04:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
current system it's working fine and
 
04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
when people want to add more oyster
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
farms or do more oyster farming they
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
have an Avenue to ask for that and we
 
04:00:31.710 --> 04:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
don't need a study committee to do it I
 
04:00:34.149 --> 04:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
ask you to vote green and support the
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%

04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
County um it would apply to every single
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
agency that is covered by
 
04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%

04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
indeed create this unworkable system of

some people counting and some people not

at all about local

control you would not support an
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%

04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
bind all kinds of entities to follow

diligence and which
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%

speaking for his Amendment thank you Mr

Speaker I res in supported the amendment
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh 2024 312 uh 12h as originally drafted
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
as I spoke a few minutes ago hbad
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
contained two specific changes to the
 
04:20:51.389 --> 04:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
rsas the second change would have
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
permitted only permitted voting on those
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
public body members physically in
 
04:20:58.109 --> 04:20:58.119 align:start position:0%
attendance however the testimony and the
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
executive committee discussion indicated
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
the potential for problems in the case
 
04:21:05.229 --> 04:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
of a very small public body I agreed
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
with that I I do agree with that this is
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
part of this is the part of the uh bill
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
that has been removed in the floor
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment now the first part remains in
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
as the entirety of what you will now be
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
voting on in the floor Amendment and
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
that is would continue the practice of
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
allowing remote participation by a
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
member of the body but it would require
 
04:21:29.790 --> 04:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
a higher hurdle needed for such remote
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
attendance currently the attendance bar
 
04:21:35.870 --> 04:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
is set in the rsas by the phrase quote
 
04:21:38.910 --> 04:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
not being reasonably practical which is
 
04:21:40.950 --> 04:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh very very
 
04:21:44.189 --> 04:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
subjective the remaining piece of hb80
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
would amend that term with put in its
 
04:21:49.229 --> 04:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
place the term
 
04:21:51.550 --> 04:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
unavoidable physical attendance at a
 
04:21:53.710 --> 04:21:53.720 align:start position:0%

04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the body would still

considered unavoidable I ask that you

04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
against thank you Mr Speaker I stand
 
04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
before for you to speak against the itl
 
04:29:18.510 --> 04:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill what is this
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
282 um what this bill does is it
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
increases the maximum benefits for our
 
04:29:26.109 --> 04:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
first responders that includes police
 
04:29:29.229 --> 04:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
officers firefighters and so on
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
currently the maximum benefit is
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a bium uh for critically
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
injured members of those
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
departments what happens is God forbid
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
we have a mass shooting or a severe fire
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
where several members of the Departments
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
get injured if we have a maximum of
 
04:29:52.349 --> 04:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
$500,000 that could be eaten through
 
04:29:55.550 --> 04:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
very quickly um under this bill it would
 
04:29:57.670 --> 04:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
still require governor and executive
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
Council approval but it would increase
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
it from $500,000 maximum to $1 million
 
04:30:07.030 --> 04:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
the maximum benefit per member is only
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
$125,000 per
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
claimant um and what this does the Ben
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
critical injury benefit provides
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
compensation to Firefighters police
 
04:30:18.990 --> 04:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
officers and correctional officers who
 
04:30:21.870 --> 04:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
sustain permanent impairments from on
 
04:30:24.070 --> 04:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
duty injuries to inter internal organs
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
or senses I mean I stand before I run on
 
04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
a backing the blue P platform and
 
04:30:32.269 --> 04:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
supporting our First Responders and I
 
04:30:34.750 --> 04:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
think the least we can do is increase
 
04:30:37.469 --> 04:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
the benefits God forbid they are injured
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the line of duty I recommend
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
everybody votes against this it L motion
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.670 --> 04:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.630 --> 04:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
Warden thank you Mr
 
04:30:58.590 --> 04:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker the previous speaker references
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
the chapter in rsa's 281a which does
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
apply to certain group two retirement
 
04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
system employees designated as First
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
Responders and what it does is allow for
 
04:31:10.950 --> 04:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
additional payments to Injured Workers
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
on top of the standard workers comp
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
payments these are for very serious
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
impairments or loss of use of internal
 
04:31:22.830 --> 04:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
organs as you heard the cap is currently
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
$125,000 per injured employee that is
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
not changed and that's not uh challenge
 
04:31:30.870 --> 04:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
in this particular Bill what we're
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill would seek to
 
04:31:37.510 --> 04:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
increase uh the maximum amount per bium
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
from 500,000 and double it to $1 million
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
we he from the Department of Labor said
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
the current cap of $500,000 has not been
 
04:31:47.870 --> 04:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
tested the most they had in a 2-year
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
period was
 
04:31:53.149 --> 04:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
$350,000 for this particular fund so the
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
committee does believe that it's
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary at this time we have no
 
04:31:59.469 --> 04:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
demonstrable need for this increase
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
further if there were to be some sort of
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
mass uh injuries event Black Swan event
 
04:32:08.189 --> 04:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
certainly this body or the governor and
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
executive counsel could find ways to uh
 
04:32:15.550 --> 04:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
supplement the fund through one offs and
 
04:32:18.149 --> 04:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
not to even consider great things like
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
gofund me and other private sector
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
options so for th those reasons uh the
 
04:32:25.870 --> 04:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
committee encourages you to vote itl
 
04:32:25.880 --> 04:32:27.910 align:start position:0%
committee encourages you to vote itl

282 this is going to be a roll call vote
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Susi for
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
if I know that law
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement firefighting and Corrections
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
are inherently dangerous professions and
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
if I know that in these professions that
 
04:34:09.150 --> 04:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
serious injuries can occur without
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
notice leading to extensive Medical
 
04:34:14.670 --> 04:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
treatment Rehabilitation and long-term
 
04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
care and if I also know that some of
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
these injuries can lead to these First
 
04:34:20.429 --> 04:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
Responders unable to return to work
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
leading to loss of income and financial
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
hardship and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
believe that we should affirm our
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
commitment to protecting those who
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
protect us but I now press the red

inqu thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
I know that the fund has not even hit
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
the current statutory limit of $500,000
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
per bonam for total payouts of
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
additional compensation so there's no
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
demonstrated need for this change and if
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
I know that in a belt-tightening
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
budgetary envir environment this
 
04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
doubling of an underutilized fund is not
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
prudent and if I know that even in a

Black Swan event with many injuries
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%

recommendation that the bill ought to
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%

McKenzie thank you Mr
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker I rise in opposition to the
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the committee in
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
legislate the workers compensation
 
04:40:11.788 --> 04:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire protects the
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
business community and it protects the
 
04:40:17.310 --> 04:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
workers the basis for workers
 
04:40:19.590 --> 04:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
compensation is that employees give up
 
04:40:22.990 --> 04:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
the right to sue their employers and in
 
04:40:25.150 --> 04:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
exchange for that they're giving a
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
system of
 
04:40:29.070 --> 04:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
benefits that provide that they return
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
to work when they can and if they can't
 
04:40:32.590 --> 04:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:40:36.190 --> 04:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
supported now an injured worker
 
04:40:38.590 --> 04:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
currently has a couple of choices when
 
04:40:40.510 --> 04:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance company decides to deny
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
that claim
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
they can file for a hearing before the
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
04:40:49.948 --> 04:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
Labor and they go in
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
prosay represent themselves or they can
 
04:40:56.350 --> 04:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
hire at their own uh their own expense
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
an attorney to represent them in the
 
04:40:59.040 --> 04:41:01.230 align:start position:0%
an attorney to represent them in the
hearing

04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:41:04.628 --> 04:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
expensive this bill looks to level the
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
playing field in every other step in the
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
work is compensation system the claim it
 
04:41:14.030 --> 04:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
if they Prevail can get the cost of the
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
attorney fees reimbursed only if they
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
Prevail and that's what this bill
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
does it allows them to recover that
 
04:41:26.830 --> 04:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
particular thing from the insurance
 
04:41:29.590 --> 04:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
company and the the idea is that this
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
would level the playing field I don't
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
want to say insurance companies are
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
denying claims intentionally I have no
 
04:41:38.910 --> 04:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
evidence to show that but it clearly
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
puts them in a an injured worker in a a
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
04:41:45.948 --> 04:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
position so all this says is you go to
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
you have a hearing you go there you're
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
an injured worker and you and you
 
04:41:53.550 --> 04:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
Prevail you get paid now let me say this
 
04:41:55.868 --> 04:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor did uh provided
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
the committee with some
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
statistics and what they said is that of
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
those people who
 
04:42:04.990 --> 04:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
appeal half of the people who file for
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
appeal withdraw the
 
04:42:09.788 --> 04:42:09.798 align:start position:0%
appeal but they said those people who
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
hire at their own expense Attorneys at
 
04:42:15.788 --> 04:42:15.798 align:start position:0%
the first level for they Prevail 45% of
 
04:42:18.670 --> 04:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
the time so having an attorney makes a
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
difference because when you show up at
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
the first level hearing and you show up
 
04:42:25.230 --> 04:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
by yourself you're going to be squaring
 
04:42:28.670 --> 04:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
off against an attorney who is an expert
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
in the area of workers compensation it's
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
clearly an unfair advantage that the
 
04:42:37.628 --> 04:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have as I said we
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
had this problem a few years ago when it
 
04:42:41.788 --> 04:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
came to medical bills recovering medical
 
04:42:44.310 --> 04:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
bills and we we corrected that this
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
legislature corrected that because it
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't an attorney around that would
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
take the case because the way attorneys
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
work and work his compensation is a
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
contingency thing that's how they work
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
so all this says is if you Prevail you
 
04:43:04.110 --> 04:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
can file for for the uh ability to get
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
re reimburse your medical bills no more
 
04:43:09.628 --> 04:43:09.638 align:start position:0%
than 20% of the of the settlement
 
04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
because that's governed by the
 
04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
department of Labor and I think this
 
04:43:15.788 --> 04:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
moves it in the right direction so my
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
colleagues I know it's late and I don't
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh want to disrespect my uh Republican
 
04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who voted
 
04:43:26.190 --> 04:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate but I would ask
 
04:43:27.868 --> 04:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
this committee to think about Injured
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
Workers and what they face and to try as
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
best we can to level a playing field for
 
04:43:36.190 --> 04:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
them and I think if we vote this down if
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
you vote against this amendment the
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and come give
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity come back so that's my
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
uh request Mr chairman and I ask for a
 
04:43:54.190 --> 04:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
Bri thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
rise in opposition of House Bill 299 due
 
04:44:01.150 --> 04:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
to the negative impacts it would have on
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
the workers comp hearing process this
 
04:44:06.030 --> 04:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
bill is problematic for three reasons
 
04:44:08.628 --> 04:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
number one increased litigation by
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
automatically awarding attorneys fees in
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
costs this bill encourages unnecessary
 
04:44:15.868 --> 04:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
legal action making litigation the first
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
Resort rather than the last number two
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
financial burden higher Insurance costs
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
for employers would likely result from
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
the Bill's suggested mandate and lastly
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
unclear cost
 
04:44:30.990 --> 04:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility the Department of Labor
 
04:44:33.270 --> 04:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
has noted there is an uncertainty as to
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
who would ultimately pay these fees and
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
costs this could lead to both legal and
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
administrative challenges ultimately
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
affecting taxpayers
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
this bill has the potential to cause far
 
04:44:46.270 --> 04:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
more problems than it solves colleagues
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote itl by pressing the
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
if I believe that this legislation is a
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
crucial step in ensuring that Injured
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
Workers are provided with the necessary
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
legal representation to claim their
 
04:46:13.110 --> 04:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
rightful benefits under the law if I
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
also believe that this legislation would
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
level the playing field between the
 
04:46:17.470 --> 04:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
injured worker and the insurance
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
companies and Mr Speaker finally if I
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
know that this legislation would
 
04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
reimburse the injured worker if they
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
Prevail at the department level would I
 
04:46:26.670 --> 04:46:26.680 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%

04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
Insurance was established to protect the
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
employee from work related
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
injuries and if I know that by adding
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
legal expenses on any medical expense
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of that insurance is going to
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
go up and we know who's going to pay for
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%

04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
