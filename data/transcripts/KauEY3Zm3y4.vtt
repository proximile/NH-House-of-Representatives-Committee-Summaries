00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
that moves it off our normal fourth
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
friday of the month
 
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.350 align:start position:0%
friday of the month
because

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
memorial day weekend and because there's
 
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.110 align:start position:0%
memorial day weekend and because there's
another

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee that meets in the morning that
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
would clash with this one
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
we usually revert to one in the
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon so
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
note may 20th at 1 pm for our next
 
00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.870 align:start position:0%

meeting

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
chair calls upon the commissioner to
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
lori shibanet commissioner of health and
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
human services just going to give you a
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
short briefing about some of the things
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
that have developed within the
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
department over the last month
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
you probably have seen that we've
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
brought forward a budget and a contract
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
for a third party operator at hampstead
 
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.029 align:start position:0%
for a third party operator at hampstead
hospital

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
the contract the budget got approved at
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
governor and council on wednesday the
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
third party contract was tabled
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
requesting more time to review
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we're doing reach out to the
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
counselors to make sure all their
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
questions have been answered we are
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
scheduled to close on hampstead around
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
the middle of may there's no date
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
certain yet
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping to have that contract
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
that close or it will obviously push off
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
the close of that facility
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
the third-party contractor
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
recovery solutions is meeting with the
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
staff at hampstead hospital the intent
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
is for them to offer employment to all
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
of the staff there
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
the leadership team at hampstead
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
hospital will be state employees the
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
long-time chief operating officer at
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
hampstead has accepted the state
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
position of ceo for that hospital
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
so she will be staying in place and we
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
are currently recruiting for the other
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
leadership positions at the hospital
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
so recovery solution is meeting with the
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
line staff now
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
it is very important that we create an
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
environment of stability for them if
 
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
environment of stability for them if
this

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
goes on for several weeks
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
line staff start to feel unstable and
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
start looking for other jobs and we
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
don't want that to happen we want to
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
keep them in-house
 
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.710 align:start position:0%
keep them in-house
so

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
so that's the update on hampstead the
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
other one question on hampstead hospital
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
from the chair you know what my question
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
will be because i've already received
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
that is in the budget that has been
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
approved so it was in the hampstead
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
budget that was approved by governor and
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
council on uh wednesday i talked to
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie about it also on
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
wednesday the way that uh the way that
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
the state typically does payment in lieu
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
of taxes is they include it with house
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill 2 every year so that way it can be
 
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.870 align:start position:0%
bill 2 every year so that way it can be
adjusted

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so i let representative guthrie know
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
that on wednesday also but we will
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
follow up with the town of hampstead for
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
another discussion if somebody could
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
shoot me a memo to that i think i've got
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
it here
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
so i i will be talking to my friends in
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
finance about three or four million
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
dollars and they'll have a big laugh and
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
we'll compromise on something that's
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
probably reasonable
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
on hampstead hospital representative
 
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.110 align:start position:0%
on hampstead hospital representative
edwards

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm a little unfamiliar with the
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
philosophy behind the state paying
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
in lieu of taxes
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
is the philosophy that
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
we pay a hundred percent of what would
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
have been gathered in the property tax
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
or is there some other way we look at it
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a different amount that's
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
calculated i think that every case is
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
looked at individually in this case we
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
are paying the tax amount because the
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
tam state hospital is such a large
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
provider of tax revenue for a small town
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
like hampstead my house being the other
 
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.150 align:start position:0%
like hampstead my house being the other
one

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.190 align:start position:0%
one
so

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
when when we looked at the conversion
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
from a private entity to state entity
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
the town of hampstead was in line to
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
lose a substantial amount of tax revenue
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to make sure to make them
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
whole for that so approximately 150 000
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
is what they what they um have always
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
received in the past couple years so
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
that is what is in the budget
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
to pay them in lieu of taxes other
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
towns and cities receive payment in lieu
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
of taxes um i think smaller but uh but
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
they do city of concord being one
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
senator rosenberg
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
um commissioner what is the
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
connection between recovery solutions
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
and well well path which is the name i
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
saw on the contract sure well recovery
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
solutions is a
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
subdivision of of well path so they have
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
two different lines of business one is
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
under corrections and one is under
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care most of the news and
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
most of the negative press that you've
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
seen about wellpath is around their
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
corrections division not around their
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
healthcare division
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
so we've been very clearly trying to
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
make that distinction for for folks so
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
that they don't get the two lines of
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
business confused
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
with any new contractor coming to the
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
state providing care for such a
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of their litigation history
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
or their quality history
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
we always put a contract in place that
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
is maximally protective of the state and
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
the people we serve so this contract
 
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.269 align:start position:0%
the people we serve so this contract
specifically

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
90 of the contract is a pass-through
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
contract so there's no incentive to cut
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
corners save money or otherwise it's a
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
direct pass-through
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
the leadership team including the
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
director of compliance which is the
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
director of quality of care is all state
 
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.710 align:start position:0%
director of quality of care is all state
employees

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh recovery solution providing the
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
clinical care and state employees
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
providing the oversight and the
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
leadership in that hospital and then we
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
obviously have the hampstead staff that
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
have been in that building for decades
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
know that the quality of care they've
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
always provided
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll make sure that we continue to
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
provide that so i feel very comfortable
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
that we have uh oversight and monitoring
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
there to ensure good quality care
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
anything else on hampstead hospital
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
please continue your report um hca is
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
the other big mental health investment
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
that we're uh
 
00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
that we're uh
we're

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
kind of sitting on right now
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
it had been on governor and council
 
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
it had been on governor and council
agenda

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
three times it was removed every time
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
for not having um support for that for
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
that accept and expend
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
so at this point the department is
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
negotiating for terms of the contract
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
with hca and plans to bring back both
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
the accept and expend and the contract
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
together to governor and council in the
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
coming months
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
there is still widespread support uh
 
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.470 align:start position:0%
there is still widespread support uh
to

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
that that we need additional inpatient
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
beds especially a diversity of beds that
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
include adult and gero psych and and
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
children and hca is certainly offering
 
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:18.389 align:start position:0%
children and hca is certainly offering
that

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.190 align:start position:0%
that
so

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
although that has been removed from
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
agendas at governor and council we do
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
expect to bring it back probably before
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
in relations to covid we're all seeing
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
the number of covet cases
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
starting to increase again we're seeing
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations increase again although
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
not as substantial as before
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
so we're all keeping an eye on that
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's across the country just not in
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
and hoping that the combination of both
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
our high vaccination rates and our
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
natural immunity rates is going to keep
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
the serious illness at bay if we have
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
another surge
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
question mr chair question
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes could you report
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
on wastewater testing in new hampshire
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
yes it was next on my list
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
um wastewater testing
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
the acceptance pen was approved by
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee last meeting we are
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
contracting with unh right now
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh the the plan is to initially utilize
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
unh to do wastewater testing at between
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
20 and 25 public wastewater facilities
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
across the state that will convert to
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
our public health lab sometime in the
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
fall the federal government has given us
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
additional guidance on one of our grants
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
that allow us to purchase the equipment
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
to do wastewater testing not just on
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
covid but other infectious disease also
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
so we will be using unh probably through
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
november and then we will convert to
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then my last thing that i would like
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
to report out on monday this past monday
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
we held a commissioner's roundtable for
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare workforce at the griponi
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
center sponsored by the endowment for
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
health we had about 70 healthcare
 
00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
health we had about 70 healthcare
leaders

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
leaders
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
in one room and had table discussions on
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to do and what we wanted
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
to prioritize going forward
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
both in the area of recruitment and
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
retention a lot of good ideas came out
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
of that jsi was our synthesizers for
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
that meeting so they're putting together
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
a report i do expect three to five
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
actionable items that i'll put a
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
proposal together for in the next 60
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
days that i'll be able to bring forward
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
on workforce recruitment and retention
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um so
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
so several times the topic of workforce
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention has come up
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
and we've i think we've tried to do a
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
few things
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
what what what do you think may come out
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
of this round that's unique or different
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
than what we've seen in the past what
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
what's the great new idea yeah i well i
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's necessarily a new
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
idea i think there's the opportunity to
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
braid some funding sources to to execute
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
some of the older ideas
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
upfront scholarship payment especially
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
for line workers like nursing assistants
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
really really um important
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
these are people that go through a
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
six-week program that
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
pay between twenty five hundred and four
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
thousand 000 to go through that
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they don't have the money up
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
front although it gets reimbursed in the
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
end so providing that upfront payment
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
that'll get reimbursed eventually
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
we talked a lot about
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
paying wages why people go to school
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
which is used in other other industries
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
for example law enforcement is a great
 
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.749 align:start position:0%
for example law enforcement is a great
example

00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers get hired by
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
the police department put through the
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
police academy and paid wages while they
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
go through
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
and then really about campaigning and
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
marketing around um diversity and
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
inclusion of of getting different people
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
into the healthcare sector and providing
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
career paths to grow within the
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
healthcare sector you know a lot of
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
people will tell stories and in
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
part part of the round table was we had
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
a student speaking and then we had a
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
long-term veteran speaking
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the l a that spoke has been an lna
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
for was an lna for 10 years her name is
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
lexi and she has always wanted to be a
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
nurse and she has no ability to go to
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
nursing school because most people need
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
to pay their bills and provide a life
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
for themselves and can't afford to stop
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
working to go to school
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
so she gave a great example of this
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
untapped resource of people that want to
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
be nursing nurses or other health care
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
professionals and just are not able to
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
take that next step so we're really
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
looking to our health care providers our
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals our nursing homes um our
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
non-profit providers like the endowment
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
for health and the charitable foundation
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
to help us braid some funding to get
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
some of those people into school and
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
workforce um commissioner this is one of
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
the things that the
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
medical facility of which i'm ceo has
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
done we've paid for people to get their
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
training in exchange for
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it has made it possible to get
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
people into the workforce so this is a
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
good thing yes
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative edwards follow-up um so i
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
just want to throw an idea at you um
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
given that we have a law that basically
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
lets all of our
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
military folks with an appropriate uh
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
training and and health care come into
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
the state and be licensed automatically
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
i i i would just uh
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
ask that we think about
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
doing some recruiting to military
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
folks who are going to be getting
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
discharged and wanting to figure out
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
where they're going to go with the rest
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
of their life um we we love having uh
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
veterans come on to our our payroll for
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
sure in in the health care sector they
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
bring a unique experience i don't think
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
general michelade's wants me out
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
recruiting his staff but
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
um no i mean people who are currently uh
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
deployed outside and belong to somebody
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
other than new hampshire yeah there are
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
things like the army times the air force
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
times there are there are newspapers
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
targeted at the military and maybe a
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
little ad
 
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.710 align:start position:0%
little ad
campaign

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
we might be able to incentivize people
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
to move to new hampshire when they don't
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
really have any other idea where they
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
want to go sure great suggestion
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
when a person gives the general his or
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
her last salute pivots and walks to the
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
front gate you'll be there i'll be there
 
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
front gate you'll be there i'll be there
right

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%

them and um oplc
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%

00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
along with healthcare licensing
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%

any other questions about anything
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 376 that established the
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
funding for mental health training cit
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
training for police officers is passed
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
the house yesterday
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it's now before finance in the house
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
and we have a work session today which i
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
plan to attend great thank you
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
the one on
 
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.310 align:start position:0%
the one on
safety

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
for medical workers
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
let me just say i think i got as much as
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
i could get and i'm not satisfied and
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
want to work with various people over
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh brought up
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
some concerns that he had had in that
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
bill what i can tell you is that
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know this has been five years in the
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
making around workplace safety for
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
health care workers and i i think that
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know logically we talked about when
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
when a health care worker gets battered
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
or assaulted in their workplace
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
logically we assume that the law
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement's going to come in and press
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
charges and and arrest that person and
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
and what we find in health care is that
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't happen as much as you
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
think it does
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
and i i think that is the impetus for
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
this type of bill um i i did tell
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards that i would go
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
back and review any amendments and he
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
was going to send me his thoughts on it
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i will do that
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
good good
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes you
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
get as much as you can and not push for
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
more than you can because then you get
 
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
more than you can because then you get
nothing

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
but we'll be back
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
senator gray
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i feel i have to comment i was the
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee plus the sponsor
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
it is very important to me that that
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
data collection stuff takes place
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
it is very important to me that the
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques happen in the
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
hospital and it is very important to me
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
that the officers
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
execute those de-escalation techniques i
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
believe that with those two
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques happening for
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
an individual that we won't have a need
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
for warrantless arrest
 
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.870 align:start position:0%
for warrantless arrest
but

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
it should be there
 
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
it should be there
and

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
as the chair has said before
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it afterward
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
certainly in deference to representative
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
edwards we want to get as close as we
 
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.909 align:start position:0%
edwards we want to get as close as we
can

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
to not needing that but it is a tool
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
senator i think you know i i agree with
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
you on the data collection i think a lot
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
of this was brought on by an increase of
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
injuries at new hampshire hospital
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
because they are so publicly reported at
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
governor and council and uh there were a
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
lot of questions when we continued to
 
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.909 align:start position:0%
lot of questions when we continued to
bring

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
bring
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
really serious injuries of our staff
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
forward at those meetings and what
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
became obvious is that we didn't know
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
how often that was happening in other
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities besides new
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital but what we do know
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
is the nurses association and the
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
medical society and all of the other
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
health care practitioners very much
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
agree and support
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
um moving forward with something that
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
helps protect our health care workers
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
and and in all health care settings not
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
just hospitals nursing homes home care
 
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.350 align:start position:0%
just hospitals nursing homes home care
everywhere

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.149 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
um

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
well okay so division three at three
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock begins the process of looking at
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
what passed the house in
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
your bill senate bill 458 you know that
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.950 align:start position:0%
uh uh
deleted

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
the uh criminal justice code
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
aspect the warrantless arrests
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
um and i hope that that gets brought
 
00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:17.909 align:start position:0%
um and i hope that that gets brought
back

00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
in its own bill
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
because if we're having these kinds of
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
issues where police will not arrest
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
somebody with witnesses saying there was
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
a battery
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's not just a health care problem
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's a new hampshire public safety
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
issue that i think we would like to
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
address more broadly and
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i'm happy to speak with you
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%

00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
and what we might do that
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
anything else for the commissioner
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative jeffrey
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
soloway to
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
find the nicest chair
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'll try to be brief but please
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
understand that for a former academic
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.789 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
is in some ways
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
a memorial
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
a week ago today
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
we laid to rest representative catherine
 
00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:12.070 align:start position:0%
we laid to rest representative catherine
rogers

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
rogers
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
um who
was

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
member of the house of representatives
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's a little difficult to talk about
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
and it was her
 
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
and it was her
wish

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
wish
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
for the legislature
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
to examine the place of precision
 
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.750 align:start position:0%
to examine the place of precision
medicine

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
and to use the powers of the legislature
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
to advance the concept of precision
 
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.310 align:start position:0%
to advance the concept of precision
medicine

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
as a result of her efforts
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman appointed an interim
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we were interim
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
to examine the issue of precision
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
medicine and to make a recommendation
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
the likelihood
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
or necessity of
 
00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
or necessity of
a

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
permanent subcommittee of dhhs oversight
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
to examine the issues of precision
 
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.710 align:start position:0%
to examine the issues of precision
medicine

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
so um the
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
chair appointed the
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
representatives and council
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
listed on this document as a temporary
 
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.590 align:start position:0%
listed on this document as a temporary
subcommittee

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.630 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
to

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
create this report
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
i must say that
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
the initial draft of this report
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
which i authored
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
was deemed by the temporary subcommittee
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
to be an extraordinary example of
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
academic overreach
 
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.710 align:start position:0%
academic overreach
and

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
instructed to as one would say
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
kick the can
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
down the road and come up with a
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
two-page recommendation and anything
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
else that i cared to include might be
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
included in an appendix
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
i did not exactly kick the can i turned
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
a little pale
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
instead i hope that
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't spill over
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
into your sense of humor the chair uh
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
caught each pun thank you
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:19.590 align:start position:0%
um so um
the

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh committee took
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
the goals of um
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative rogers initial
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and transposed them into
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
this document you will find that at the
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one and on through page
 
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one and on through page
two

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
there is an attempt to define precision
 
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.190 align:start position:0%
there is an attempt to define precision
medicine

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.149 align:start position:0%
medicine
um

00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
and on
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page two and then
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
beginning on page three the middle of
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
basically are the recommendations that
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
um we implement a task force on
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
precision medicine composed of
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
two senators
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
one from each of the major parties three
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
members of the house of representatives
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
two from majority one from minority uh
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
members who will have demonstrated
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
interest in health care the commissioner
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner are you still here um uh or
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
an appropriate designee
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner of insurance or an
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%

citizen advocacy group
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
an example might be the new hampshire
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
cancer society and i would point out
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
that the cancer society has been a very
 
00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:35.750 align:start position:0%
that the cancer society has been a very
constructive

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
constructive
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
advocate for the search for
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
new solutions in the areas of cancer and
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
is probably an appropriate appointee
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative of
 
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.909 align:start position:0%
representative of
reimbursement

00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
and that would mean
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
we have to have the insurers at the
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
table a representative of the medical
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
i probably should have included
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital association
 
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.950 align:start position:0%
the hospital association
and

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
i i apologize for that oversight and
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'll have to fix that
 
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.110 align:start position:0%
i'll have to fix that
um

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
so the instructions to the task force
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
are included beginning at the bottom of
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
page three and on page four and
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
endlessly beyond
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
is the appendix
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
with what are
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
my manipulative recommendations for the
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
the task force should be looking at i'd
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
like to point out that there are two
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
philosophical issues that arise in this
 
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.430 align:start position:0%
philosophical issues that arise in this
um

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues on the
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
interim subcommittee
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
have instructed me well in this area
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
need to understand that modern medicine
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
is a little over a hundred years old
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
it was only with the publication of the
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
flexner report in 1910
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh sponsored by the carnegie commission
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
that we moved from
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
practicing what i would call inductive
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
medicine well let's see what works and
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
we'll try it here to deductive medicine
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
where we said we need to base medicine
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
in contemporary science and over the
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
last 120 years we have pushed that basic
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
science to lead us in the direction of
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
what is now precision medicine
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
that philosophical shift
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
to science-based medicine now blossoms
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
with the concept of precision medicine
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's described for you in the appendix
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i won't burden you with my discourse
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
having said that there's another
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
philosophical challenge that awaits us
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
on health and human services oversight
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
and in the legislature and that is what
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate role of the
 
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.870 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate role of the
legislature

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.070 align:start position:0%
legislature
in

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.430 align:start position:0%
in
managing

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
managing
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
the entry of this new form of medical
 
00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:11.590 align:start position:0%
the entry of this new form of medical
practice

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.630 align:start position:0%
practice
into

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
our health care industry here in new
 
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.310 align:start position:0%
our health care industry here in new
hampshire

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
do we have an obligation to assist
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial efforts should we be
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
assisting the development of new science
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
should we be
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
regulating reimbursement for the
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
services that are available should we be
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
finding ways to guarantee that those
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
with limited insurance have access to
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
precision medicine or
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
my friends
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
should we simply take on our normal
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
regulatory role and permit an
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial system within
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
academic medical centers
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
and private industry to lead this
 
00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.430 align:start position:0%
and private industry to lead this
forward

00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting philosophical
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
question which i assume we will debate
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
and we will come up with our
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
suggestions for the state legislature
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
um at this point i would like to hand
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
this report over to the chairman for his
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
wise implementation of its
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations as he sees fit and thank
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
you for patiently listening
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
i want to say sir thank you for your
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
work and i find the appendix to be
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
really cool
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
because if it were a hot appendix would
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your sharp comments sir
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
i do have a question on the membership
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
of the task force
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
i hardly agree that the hospital
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
association should be
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
one of the ones listed
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
i also wonder if there is a place for
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
alumni house
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
and senate persons who do not otherwise
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
fit in under any of these categories and
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
the reason is i'm already doing advanced
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
planning for who might be in my
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
health human services and elderly
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
affairs committee going forward because
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
i have already heard six of the 21
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
members will not be running again and so
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
as i'm trying to think about
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
how are we going to
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
staff that i also see that there will be
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
a brain drain from my committee
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
and wish that at least some of those
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
brains might be folded into this task
 
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:38.790 align:start position:0%
brains might be folded into this task
force

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
so those would be a couple of
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
changes i might like to make
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
on the staffing on this issue does
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
so mr chair i have i have to just
 
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
so mr chair i have i have to just
restate

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
restate
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
a belief that
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
five to seven is kind of the ideal
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
number of people on any committee if you
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
want the committee to to do work
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe a concept to consider
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
is to is to limit
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
the thou shall appoint
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
such and such
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
to like a maximum of seven
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
and then include a at the discretion of
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
others may be invited to give you the
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
discretionary subject matter expertise
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
at the table
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative soloway i i agree with
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards typically so
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's room for
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
ex-officios and given that we have a
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
full oversight committee that could be
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
the larger
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
audience for the report of the task
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
force that would provide a wider point
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
of view i think he's quite correct that
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
seven is kind of maximum to be agile and
 
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
seven is kind of maximum to be agile and
active

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
well i find 11 even before we've invited
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital association or anyone else
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
so the question is who would be removed
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
i would offer that you could remove one
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
senator because i don't think this is
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
partisan i think this is this transcends
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
any partisan issues and
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know we already as almost as a rule
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
in the senate wherever bill comes with
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
two members we reduce it to one
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
is it your thought representative
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
soloway that work product would find its
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
way to oversight before it goes on its
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
so then we would get the bipartisanship
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
would you think then two members of the
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
which was not meant to assume the
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
hospital association has been dropped if
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
we include the hospital association mr
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
chairman i get 10. that's what i get if
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
just as a disclaimer i offered an
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
organizational theory i don't i don't
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
think it's a rule it's just a thought to
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
if we go over seven we just need to
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
aware we're becoming a little uh
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
clumsier and less flexible
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative soloway do you see that
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
let's call it gang of ten for the moment
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh breaking into a few subgroups for
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
particular things to report bark to
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
their larger group
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
which would take it out from being as
 
00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.150 align:start position:0%
which would take it out from being as
unwieldy

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'll uh redraft that section mr chairman
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
and have that to you by monday
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that the hospital
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
association is very definitely part of
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely and unequivocally uh ms
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
minahan my apologies for not including
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
and alumni house and senate members
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
could certainly be brought in as expert
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
witnesses or co-opted i have that with
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
my deaf and hard of hearing commission i
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
literally do not know
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
the people sitting around the table
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
whether they're members or just they
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
show up all the time
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
but they get a good voice and uh we've
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
never voted because we always nod
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so it really doesn't matter that
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
much but if we ever had to i think i can
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
be told who the core people are who are
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote
 
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.910 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote
so

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
on your desk monday mr chairman thank
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.790 align:start position:0%
you representative
nelson

00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
10 heads better than seven
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we've got ted
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
i would think so somebody mentioned that
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
i deal with seven people
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
well i guess i'm supporting the idea of
 
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
having ten which would be the
 
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.510 align:start position:0%
having ten which would be the
okay

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right that's one item on this um
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
other aspects of his report
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
so napoleon used to
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
have his generals write
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
operations orders and and then they
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
would be read to the corporal that was
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
standing outside the tent standing guard
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
usually an illiterate individual
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the rule was that unless napoleon's
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
corporal understood the order
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
they had to go back and simplify it and
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
rewrite it so
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
standing as
 
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.190 align:start position:0%
standing as
the

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
napoleon's corporal in your committee
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
i i do appreciate the the reformatting
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh i i think i think it just will make
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
more sense but um as i'm looking at the
 
00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.790 align:start position:0%
more sense but um as i'm looking at the
appendix

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
appendix
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm seeing
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh the implication
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
that clinical effectiveness will be a
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
part of our assessment of of uh the
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
technologies but i don't think i read
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
the word clinical effectiveness anywhere
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
i just i'm curious if it's if you think
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's necessary is it embedded in some of
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
these other aspects or should it be its
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
own category i don't know
 
00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:27.589 align:start position:0%
own category i don't know
representative

00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
i take a page from your book
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
whether the legislature has a role to
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
play in the relationship between
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
professional and patient
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
and clinical effectiveness is a
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
determination that i think ought to be
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
made by the professionals and not the
 
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.150 align:start position:0%
made by the professionals and not the
legislators

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
and sir you have been a fine general
 
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.390 align:start position:0%
and sir you have been a fine general
disciplining

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
disciplining
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
i may not have seen it i may have
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
skimmed over it
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
very concise statement of purpose for
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
this group what is the job
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like a lot of academic
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
investigation which is fantastic always
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
measure before you cut particularly in
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
surgery but is there a specific task
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
that this group
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
this task force will do uh page two sir
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
the task force shall and there is a list
 
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.990 align:start position:0%
the task force shall and there is a list
of

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
five items that the task force will
 
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.069 align:start position:0%
five items that the task force will
accomplish

00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you let's take a look at
 
00:41:42.160 --> 00:42:04.069 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you let's take a look at
that

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
would you include at this point
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
a discussion if not a determination
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
of what the various roles of
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature and other groups might
 
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.630 align:start position:0%
the legislature and other groups might
be

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
in going forward with such information
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
i would suggest sir that it would be
 
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.109 align:start position:0%
i would suggest sir that it would be
the

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
obligation of the task force to make
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the oversight
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee and for the oversight
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee to then make its legislative
 
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.550 align:start position:0%
committee to then make its legislative
suggestions

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.430 align:start position:0%
suggestions
to

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
but i think that goes beyond
 
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.630 align:start position:0%
but i think that goes beyond
the

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
prerogatives of a task force
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
but making recommendations to oversight
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
would would you put that in yes as f yes
 
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.990 align:start position:0%
would would you put that in yes as f yes
done

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
other thoughts other thoughts on the
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
report the duties represent senator
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you mr chairman
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm on page three i note that down
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
toward the bottom you save members of
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
the task force will receive a mileage
 
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.109 align:start position:0%
the task force will receive a mileage
allowance

00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
allowance
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
for attendance as is the practice of the
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
house and senate i i think the practice
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
is that legislative members
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
get a mileage allowance and not all
 
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.470 align:start position:0%
get a mileage allowance and not all
members

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
members
um

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
i i believe senator that that's covered
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
remember oh i see what you're saying no
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
members of the task force right okay
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
legislative members
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislative members that we got it
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
typically include and not
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
other members
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
i thought that was included under as is
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
the practice of the house and senate but
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly glad to include the word
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislative at the beginning and that
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
should be fine
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
senator is the assumption here
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
that the other members might be
 
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.510 align:start position:0%
that the other members might be
reimbursed

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
by their work
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%

nursing association or
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative of the hospital
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
association they take care of
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
the mileage for people appearing here
 
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.550 align:start position:0%
the mileage for people appearing here
i

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.150 align:start position:0%
i
i

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know how to make assumptions
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
about that i'm just not remembering
 
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.910 align:start position:0%
about that i'm just not remembering
seeing

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:35.890 align:start position:0%
that all task force members
 
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.270 align:start position:0%
that all task force members

new hampshire legislative cancer caucus
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%

cancer society on developments in the
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
use of biomarker testing and i thought
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
it was just appropriate to
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
inform the committee of this and there's
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
a notice in the senate uh calendar to
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%

00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
has people to nominate that
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh you send it to the oversight for
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
brief consideration and then it can go
 
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.430 align:start position:0%
brief consideration and then it can go
on

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%

questions uh regarding exactly what the
 
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.950 align:start position:0%
questions uh regarding exactly what the
benefit

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
design is at this point and what is
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
covered and not covered it has been
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
in my reports our reports to you you
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
know we have gone through all of that so
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anyone has any questions
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
at this point i'm happy to answer them
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
senator guida just to comment mr chair
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
that sitting on finance in the senate
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to have as sharp a
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
pencil as you can to be able to detail
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
for the relevant provisions in in the
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
dental benefit well okay absolutely
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you do you know
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
at this point if the benefit will
 
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:47.270 align:start position:0%
at this point if the benefit will
require

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
a waiver from cms or just a state plan
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment actually both um to do the the
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
denture provision the way we are uh
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
where it is waiver populations that are
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
covered by that that portion will
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
require a waiver and of course we will
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
have to do a state plan amendment okay
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
but we have you know again in our report
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
this month a timeline which may flux a
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
little bit depending on when legislation
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
but you know we're we are planning
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what steps have to happen so
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
that we have cms approval uh when it's
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
required okay
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up reinforce the
 
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.950 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up reinforce the
reinforcement

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
reinforcement
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
sticking to the timeline so that
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
we could get to a benefit
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
within the biennium
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
believe me i want to see that happen and
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
then that is my intention and we will do
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
our best to meet all the deadlines that
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
we need to to achieve that otherwise
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise i just fear somebody's grubby
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
hand is going to try to push the clicker
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
back to zero and we'll have to start all
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
over again
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
dr finney i you you addressed the waiver
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
and plan update required for the denture
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
component i understood um that something
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
was needed to be done also on the co-pay
 
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.589 align:start position:0%
was needed to be done also on the co-pay
aspect

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
i apologize yes there is also another
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
type of
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
waiver that is done for the cost sharing
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
but they're all we have already been in
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
discussion with cms and those things are
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
are lining up so so that's kind of my
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up you you already have had
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
verbal assurances from cms that they
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
want to support both of these aspects
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes because we did not want the
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to move forward if it wasn't
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
something that we could do
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
under cms guidance thank you thank you
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
senator guida
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh i've had expressions of concern from
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
a number of dental practitioners about
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
missed appointments
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
which is essentially a consumable that
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
is then perished
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh is there any
 
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.510 align:start position:0%
uh is there any
uh

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
language or
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism to address that issue and
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps to
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
remind recalcitrant or repeated
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
offenders if you will that the benefit
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
is not perpetual if you continue to miss
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
your appointments
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes let me elaborate
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
so the work group had dental
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
representation and that very concern was
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
very much on the table
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
built into the cost structure is a care
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
coordination component
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
and a transportation component so that
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
that precious commodity of dentist time
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
and empty chair is minimized to the
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
extent possible um and i think part of
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
dentist's willingness to participate is
 
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
dentist's willingness to participate is
also

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
part of the funding include some
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
you do okay representative edward so
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this is sort of a
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up to senator guida's uh
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
question and mr whitman's uh response i
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think that the no-show issue
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
we talked about finding some way to
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
financially uh penalize people who
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
who didn't show
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
we we ended up rejecting that
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
um but because the uh the initial
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
checkups and cleaning
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
are exempt from the co-pay there's not a
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
financial barrier for people going and
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
getting a checkup
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then if they are diagnosed where
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
they need significant care uh for their
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
teeth then they they would have a
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
personal incentive to show up and so
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
i i might my hope is that we
 
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.549 align:start position:0%
i i might my hope is that we
experience

00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
a kind of a level of no-shows
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
that isn't much worse
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
than the commercial marketplace that's
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's my belief going into this
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's the way it should play out
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
particularly with the extra supports
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
given the types of population served
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
that uh being built into the plan here
 
00:56:35.599 --> 00:56:37.190 align:start position:0%
that uh being built into the plan here
um

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know i have some experience when i
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
was on the provider side about the empty
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
chair issue so i can assure you that i
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
fully appreciate
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
what you're saying here
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
i i think the the only thing that i
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
would add to that is that you know
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
certainly i myself as a past practicing
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
dentist i am very you know aware of the
 
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.549 align:start position:0%
dentist i am very you know aware of the
situation

00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that it was important that
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
we come up with a solution that didn't
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
make the dentist responsible for trying
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
to chase down those patients and that
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're offering something on the plan
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
side that will support individuals
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
getting to the appointments and not
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
making that another burden for the
 
00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:22.549 align:start position:0%
making that another burden for the
dentist

00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%

and we're here today to provide an

update um on what the department is
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
calling the developmental disability

systems work project
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
um but i would like to begin by talking
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
about um putting this into a bit of
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
context relative to how it is that we
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
got to where we are here today
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
and i want to reference
 
00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:43.190 align:start position:0%
and i want to reference
three

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.549 align:start position:0%
three
studies

00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
that were conducted over the past recent
 
00:58:47.359 --> 00:58:49.270 align:start position:0%
that were conducted over the past recent
history

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
in february of 2016 there was an a
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
legislative budget analyst
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
audit of the bureau of developmental
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
services around unspent appropriations
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
it was a performance audit
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
and in that their recommendations
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
included some 12 observations that
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
included such areas as
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies within the service
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
delivery system
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
insufficient management controls to
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
track certain
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
people on the waitlist and maintenance
 
00:59:20.559 --> 00:59:21.910 align:start position:0%
people on the waitlist and maintenance
clients

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
clients
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
and a lack of management controls over
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
information technology systems upon
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
which the service delivery system relied
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
then in december of 2016 the centers for
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid and medicare services
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
sent correspondents to the state
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
whereas the center cms had determined
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire was out of compliance
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
with two areas with its service system
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
for people with
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities specifically people with
 
00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.910 align:start position:0%
disabilities specifically people with
intellectual

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
intellectual
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
developmental and acquired brain injury
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
and those two areas were direct pay and
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest regulations
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
the direct pay rule
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
has to do with the way the service
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
delivery system was designed and
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
operating in the state of new hampshire
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
and is today
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
we contract out with the area agency
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
system and then they will subcontract to
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
a variety of vendors and other providers
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
to provide services
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
in order to receive reimbursement the
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
provider works back through the area
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
agency and the area agency is the entity
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
currently that bills directly
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
to the medicaid system
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
cms called foul and said that anyone who
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
is a medicaid provider should be able to
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
do a direct bill
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
so that became a focus of work the
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
second part under cms was what's called
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
and it's a violation
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
for those on 1915 c waivers
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is what is on medicaid
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
1915 c waivers so the intellectual
 
01:01:04.559 --> 01:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
1915 c waivers so the intellectual
disability

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
acquired brain injury ihs waivers are
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
1915 c waivers
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
and they require the state to have
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
separate service plan development case
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
management providers from those who are
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
providing the direct service provision
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
so in other words you can't evaluate
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
determine what a person needs develop a
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
plan and then also provide the service
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
you must pass that on now there are ways
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
we do have independent case management
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
agencies that perform that service
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we do have some area agencies that
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
have set up separate corporations that
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
do have
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a firewall so that
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
they are considered not in conflict
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
but again this was a second study that
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
said that there are concerns
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
that need to be taken into consideration
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
with the dd system
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
published in february of 2020 the
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
governor's commission on disabilities
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
analysis and report
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
by a committee to study the state's
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
system of very long title the dd system
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
in essence and make recommendations
 
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.349 align:start position:0%
in essence and make recommendations
thereof

01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
thereof
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
it was as the request of house bill 2
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the committee which was a broad
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
group of stakeholders including family
 
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
group of stakeholders including family
members

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
advocates lobbyists and others
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
interestingly many who are on the
 
01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.190 align:start position:0%
interestingly many who are on the
current

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
advisory committee for the current
 
01:02:37.039 --> 01:02:37.990 align:start position:0%
advisory committee for the current
project

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
were part of that study
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
coming out of that study
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
there were some 13 target improvement
 
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
there were some 13 target improvement
areas

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
the group met extensively throughout the
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
fall of 2019
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
and published in
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
early spring this study that came out
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
some of the areas that were highlighted
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
was the need for intensive treatment
 
01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.670 align:start position:0%
was the need for intensive treatment
services

01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
transition supports and services we
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
identified several operational
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that needed to happen
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
within the uh service system
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
they needed a quality workforce
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh waiver considerations and concerns
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
relative to that
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
and perhaps most importantly
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
system cost curving the committee
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
recognized that there was an imperative
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
to look at the future of long-term
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
services and supports
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
by improving areas where costs had grown
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
at an accelerated rate
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
in recent years
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
and is expected to rise
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionately so really was
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
optimal to get your hands around what
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
was going on in this service system and
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
look at addressing some of the
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies with how the service
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
system was operating
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
then serendipitously in 2020 the
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
department contracted with alvarez and
 
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.470 align:start position:0%
department contracted with alvarez and
marcel

01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
marcel
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
to do a study of the department and to
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
identify and make recommendations
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
relative to certain efficiencies that
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
could help within the department
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
to address a number of
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
factors and uh
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
what happened from that is that the
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
department did contract with alvarez and
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
marcel and work began in the early fall
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
of 2021
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
and we're here today to give you a bit
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
of an update in terms of where that work
 
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.470 align:start position:0%
of an update in terms of where that work
is

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
and give you a sense of what
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
has gone on
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
if you would turn to the
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
well it's actually the first slide
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
past the title it's page two
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
that has as its headline dd systems work
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
original findings
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
some of you who we were able to meet
 
01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:46.309 align:start position:0%
some of you who we were able to meet
with

01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
in late fall
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
may recognize the scatter graph that's
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
and what this demonstrates
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
um each of those dots actually
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
represents a person
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
um and it the x-axis is measuring the
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
person's assessed level of support that
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
they need
 
01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:06.630 align:start position:0%
they need
um

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
and how their high their needs are and
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
then the y-axis is measuring how much
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
funding each person actually received
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
during a fight a fiscal year
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
in an ideal world we'd like to see a
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
much more tight relationship between a
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
person's level of need and their funding
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
but as you can see in this scatter graph
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
that's obviously not what's happening
 
01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:29.829 align:start position:0%
that's obviously not what's happening
here

01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
so this is an indication that there are
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
reasons why we need to do a deeper dive
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
and get our hands around what is going
 
01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.190 align:start position:0%
and get our hands around what is going
on

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
with identifying people's needs and
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
matching that up with appropriate
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
funding issues
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
there are systems issues
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side that have been
 
01:05:50.319 --> 01:05:51.829 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side that have been
identified

01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
are really three areas information
 
01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.750 align:start position:0%
are really three areas information
technology

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
operational and policy
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
and it makes the very challenging for
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
to monitor and adjust service provision
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
to support the people
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
for whom we are mandated to be serving
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so the data indicates that some
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
recipients do not receive service
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
funding that really aligns with their
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
assessed level of need
 
01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:19.990 align:start position:0%
assessed level of need
the

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
service system providers are reimbursed
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
with rates that are have not been
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
updated in more than a decade
 
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
updated in more than a decade
and

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
the bureau of developmental services is
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
operating with an antiquated
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
siloed information technology systems
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
which do not allow adequate reporting on
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring or timely assessing
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
and so this then has become the focus of
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
the work that we've been focused on with
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
alvarez and marcel
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
so just drawing um your attention to the
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
third slide there
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
to better serve individuals and protect
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
our federal funding we need significant
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
updates to our current operations
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
policies in its system as nancy said
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
so for our waiver updates
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
to improve the supply and quality of
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
services available
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
we're amending our medicaid 1915 c
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
waiver to have more specific service
 
01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.710 align:start position:0%
waiver to have more specific service
definitions

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
because our current waiver is very broad
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
it has very broad service definitions
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
providers and area agencies across the
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
state deliver services in different ways
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
and sometimes don't deliver services
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
because there's not a policy for funding
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
those services or to support that idea
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
so this can lead to
 
01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
so this can lead to
inequities

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
inequities
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
and limited services for people with
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
by improving those service definitions
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
and increasing the types of services
 
01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:57.430 align:start position:0%
and increasing the types of services
available

01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
our intent is to improve the quality of
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
services and the supply of services and
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
the consistent delivery of those
 
01:08:04.319 --> 01:08:05.750 align:start position:0%
the consistent delivery of those
services

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that whether if
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
somebody lives here in concord or lives
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
in conway they have access to the same
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
high quality services and provided in a
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
way which makes sense in their community
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
improving service definition is also
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
imperative to the rate setting work
 
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.550 align:start position:0%
imperative to the rate setting work
that

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that rates more directly align
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
with the services that are being
 
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:30.470 align:start position:0%
with the services that are being
provided

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
so the department is developing a new
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
rate methodology that will be based on
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
up-to-date data
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
the intent of this change is twofold
 
01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.390 align:start position:0%
the intent of this change is twofold
first

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's important to update the
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates to more accurately
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
reflect the cost of providing services
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
so that providers have
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
adequate resources to render those
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
services and secondly we're
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
transitioning to rates that will be
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
based on an individual's
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
level of need
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
so to assess an individual's level of
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
need the department will be using
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
the supports intensity scale otherwise
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
known as the cis assessment to inform
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
this work for rate setting
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
this is a tool that's been used in new
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire previously but only for
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
planning and not for individual
 
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.550 align:start position:0%
planning and not for individual
budgeting

01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
budgeting
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're developing rates so that a
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
person's cis assessment score will
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
inform the reimbursement amount that
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
providers receive
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
for delivering a service to that
 
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.229 align:start position:0%
for delivering a service to that
individual

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
by more closely aligning reimbursement
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
rates with individual support needs we
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
will be better able to ensure people
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
have access to the right level of
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
funding to purchase those services
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether they have low service needs or
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
high service needs
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
structuring rates in this way will also
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the amount and
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
type of data the state has available to
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
support budget forecasting and fiscal
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal control
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
another key component of our rates work
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
is the transition to direct bill as
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
nancy was talking about
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
cms has required that all developmental
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
disability providers enroll with
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid so they have the option to bill
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
services directly or use a third-party
 
01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.669 align:start position:0%
services directly or use a third-party
biller

01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
biller
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
completing this enrollment will ensure
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire does not lose our
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
federal funding and it will empower
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
providers to enter the service delivery
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
system directly
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
for the information technology the new
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
system including direct bill and updated
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
rates will not be operational without
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
the support of a modernized i.t system
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're contracting with deloitte to build
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
a new it system for the bureau
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
area agencies providers case managers
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
and individuals will benefit because
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
some of our slowest plot processes
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently will become automated
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
the department will also have access to
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
better data we'll be able to track data
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
such as time to service and actual spend
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
which will help us monitor
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
the system and correct inequity should
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards for a question
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
on this point
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
so so you caught my attention when you
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
said deloitte was building an i.t system
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
does that mean you're not using a
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
commercial off-the-shelf product in any
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
way that they're writing unique code
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we are working with new heights um
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
which is a current system that we use so
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
deloitte and new heights and our um
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
systems teams are working together to
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
create that system follow up
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay so there there is a commercial
 
01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.550 align:start position:0%
okay so there there is a commercial
product

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
and you're tweaking the product exactly
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
and it's the product that the
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
department's been using for the last at
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
least 20 years so we are feeding into
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
that we're taking the four antiquated
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
systems and reworking them and and then
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
one other
 
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.990 align:start position:0%
one other
um

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.870 align:start position:0%
um
this

01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
cis score
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
seems critical
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious if there are underlying
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
algorithms within new heights that
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
generate the cis score or if this is an
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
individual going into the system and
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
doing an off sheet calculation and then
 
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.630 align:start position:0%
doing an off sheet calculation and then
inserting

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
inserting
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
what they determine the score to be how
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
how is that cis score
 
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.510 align:start position:0%
how is that cis score
calculated

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
well and i don't mean how i'm not
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
looking for the math i'm just looking
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
for if it's done by a computer algorithm
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
or if it's done
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
mostly due to human intervention
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been done by a technological
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
algorithm to date because we had not
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
been using it
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
make determinations relative to a
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
relationship or a correlation to cost of
 
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
relationship or a correlation to cost of
care

01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
so but we are
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
contracting out with the national
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
organization that actually uh oversees
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
the sis and we'll be doing some 400
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
samples relative to that and as part of
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll be looking at how we want to
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
roll that into the the technology that
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
we are working on relative to the system
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
i mean it would make um complete sense
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
to have a technological uh answer to the
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
algorithm there's no question so that
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
subjectivity if you will
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
were removed from that
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
it is not the only tool that we look at
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of what kind of supports people
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
need there is a medical
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
review also
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
that looks at some of the behavioral
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
challenges as well
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
um and we are continuing to work on that
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
as we go forward but i understand the
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
absolute necessity of of your question
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
so so um with within uh the kind of the
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
norming you also we also want to have
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
consistent approaches throughout the
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
entire patient population right so
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's the that's a key goal so
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
subjectivity is a little bit of a threat
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
to that absolutely and it always is in
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
terms of any of these evidence-based
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
tools so yeah we want to i i i do
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate your answer thank you
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um ms rollins in
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
the interest of bringing it to the
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
ground ground level your guidance on
 
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.070 align:start position:0%
ground ground level your guidance on
uh

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
these the cis
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
um algorithm would that be the right
 
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.590 align:start position:0%
um algorithm would that be the right
description

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
description
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
or the cis scores yes
 
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.630 align:start position:0%
or the cis scores yes
scores

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
scores
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay and um
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
therefore require a change in how the
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
iep and the isp would be
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
reported to qualify for said funding
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
um it would be taken into account
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
because part of this is
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
um as you know
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know we do the evaluations
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
assessments are done
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
tool will be utilized in terms of
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the overall care plan and
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
then working that relative to the cost
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
of care um that will be applied so it
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
will all sort of be interrelated and uh
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
rolled in together
 
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
to get the benefit of your guidance
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
there would that um indicate that the
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
area agencies would need that would not
 
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:14.790 align:start position:0%
area agencies would need that would not
need

01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
would have a requirement of a new
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
paradigm for information gathering id
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
like for like for an iep so that it
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
would correlate with the funding um
 
01:15:26.239 --> 01:15:28.149 align:start position:0%
would correlate with the funding um
qualifications

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
yes so the area agencies service
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
providers providing services to clients
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
would in essence have a new paradigm
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
relative to it is a tool that we've used
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the past but how it's being applied
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh for client care um and cost of care
 
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh will be different and so okay and
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
then just in closing on that uh is when
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh then what's your target for when that
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
is available so that when the
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh qualification for funding it that the
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
documentation meets what you require to
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
for this for the cms to give their
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
blessing yep and so you'll see on the
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
next page there's a timeline um that
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
will melissa will go through um it is we
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
need to do the 400 uh sample
 
01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
need to do the 400 uh sample
first

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
but everything is part of those
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
milestones and i also want to say that
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
in all of this work
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
unprecedented in my experience the
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
amount of stakeholder involvement
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
relative to doing this work
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
both from the actual providers as well
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
as many of the vendors but certainly
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
family members and self-advocates this
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
is an important
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
but very significant
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
change to how the service system does
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
its business
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the value system that
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
exists within the dd program
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the statute that has
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
the underlying values of our service
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
system what it changes is how we do
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
business and for any of you in any
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
industry change is hard
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
change is confusing
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
change is going to be met with
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
resistance and other
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts and concerns
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
but we are working this with
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
stakeholders as best we can
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
and continuing forward it is the right
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
to get our arms around this service
 
01:17:30.159 --> 01:17:31.430 align:start position:0%
to get our arms around this service
system

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
that as you hear from what i stated at
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning has been under scrutiny
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
for a significant period of time in
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
terms of how it operates and to put it
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
bluntly we need to bring it into the
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
21st century
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
so sorry for the
 
01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.709 align:start position:0%
so sorry for the
opinion

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think would agree
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
question relates to the 915c waiver
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be separate case
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
managers from those providing the
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
services uh is this an issue in new
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire at this point in time we're
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
not adequately implementing that and can
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
you elaborate please so we're under a
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
corrective action
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
plan um and we have an extension
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
again everything like the world um was
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted in our timelines
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
with covid 19. so we um
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
must correct this by june of 2023 we're
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
under an extension but we are working on
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
a corrective action plan and it is
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
rolled into the work that we're doing
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
with alvarez and marcel
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
um and to that point um which just flew
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
there was another part of that and i'll
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
probably need to come back
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
right i i wanted to to know and and i
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
think you've answered this you may
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're under a corrective action plan
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
because we're not currently implementing
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
the separate correct a case manager
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
requirement correct um
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question relates to senate
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill 333
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
do we have to be very careful that we
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't confuse the definition of the
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
providers and the case manager so that
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
you can actually implement this correct
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
action but we do have to be careful that
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're not confusing
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
things and i think we need to keep that
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
as simple as possible
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it only applies to the 1915 c
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.870 align:start position:0%
and it only applies to the 1915 c
waivers

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
this conflict of interest matter is not
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in targeted case
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
management or in the other areas of the
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
healthcare industry it is only subject
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
to the 1915 c waivers and so that is
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
largely the area agencies and yes the
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
work that we are doing with them is to
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
make those distinctions as to what
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
function they will provide whether
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
they'll have that oversight and
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation and assessment component
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
and or be a service provider
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
so we are working with them as
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
organizations um in in a variety of
 
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
organizations um in in a variety of
arenas

01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
arenas
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to continue your report
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um continuing on slide three
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
for the last box for intensive treatment
 
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.990 align:start position:0%
for the last box for intensive treatment
services

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the bureau is responsible for serving
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
individuals with varying and differing
 
01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.950 align:start position:0%
individuals with varying and differing
needs

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
including this are individuals with the
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
most complex care needs
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
being diagnosed with a developmental
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
disability and dually with a mental
 
01:20:25.679 --> 01:20:27.430 align:start position:0%
disability and dually with a mental
health

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
or behavioral health concern
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
so traditionally these were services are
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
referred to as intensive treatment
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
services or its
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
given the more complex supports that are
 
01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.550 align:start position:0%
given the more complex supports that are
required

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately due to the state lacking
 
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.030 align:start position:0%
unfortunately due to the state lacking
capacity

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
many of these individuals that are
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
requiring its services are served out of
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
state at the current time
 
01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
state at the current time
so

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
with the increasing federal pressure as
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
well as the commitment to serve people
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire locally
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
this has led to an expedited schedule to
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
develop a transition plan
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
for those served out of state so the
 
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.229 align:start position:0%
for those served out of state so the
bureau

01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
along with area agencies have started
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
working on transition planning
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
activities for a targeted group of
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
individuals as well as starting to view
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
a long-term in-state capacity
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
and then lastly on the last slide um
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
slide four
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
which gives our timeline and and what to
 
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.709 align:start position:0%
which gives our timeline and and what to
expect

01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
expect
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
so we've provided a sample of our major
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
activities from last year and show the
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
work that we expect to complete between
 
01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.629 align:start position:0%
work that we expect to complete between
now

01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
and next summer
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
a major part of our work as nancy said
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
is stakeholder engagement the department
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes the magnitude of planned
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
changes in the developmental services
 
01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.189 align:start position:0%
changes in the developmental services
delivery

01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
understandably stakeholders have
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
questions about the work
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
we understand that our timeline and our
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
work plan may be overwhelming to some
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
and the department welcomes input and
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations by all of our
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in an attempt to learn from
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and encourage them to shape
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
the work the department has stopped a
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
robust stakeholder engagement process
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
so this includes a series of monthly
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
work groups focused on the high priority
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
topics of this work including
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
self-advocates family members advocacy
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
groups and providers are developing
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
implementation recommendations to the
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
department for our consideration
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are deeply invested in the
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
system and some feel that this level of
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
engagement is not sufficient we're doing
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
our best to be responsive to all of
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
these concerns by incorporating their
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions into our stakeholder
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
engagement plans for example
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the month of may we as the department
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
will be going out to the community to
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
have in-person meetings across the state
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
that will give community members direct
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
access to the department of
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
representatives representatives to ask
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions about this work and discuss it
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
so we are planning those
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
as we speak
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
it is impossible to implement every
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we're given however
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're diligently trying to respond to
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
people's feedback and have meaningful
 
01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
people's feedback and have meaningful
conversations

01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
with people impacted by the work we take
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
our stakeholder feedback and input
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
seriously and appreciate their
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
dedication to make the system stronger
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
for individuals and their families
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
together with our community members
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
we're making progress on system
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
improvements we have onboarded the
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
vendor who will help us develop our new
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
rate methodology this group is myers and
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
stauffer and we're currently working to
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
collect the data we need
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
for the new rate development which would
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
include the cis scores
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
with the waiver work group we started
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
drafting revised service definitions
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
and this is include identifying
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
innovative and new service options to
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
better align
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
with the supports individuals and
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
families want to receive
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
so in the next few months we're going to
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
work on completing the sample round for
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
cis assessments
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
these cis assessments will be the sample
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
that myers and stauffer again use to
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
inform these new rates
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
and we're also going to review a series
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
of recommendations around how to
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
strengthen the direct support
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
professional workforce
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
we have a stakeholder subcommittee
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
and is currently developing some of
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
these recommendations
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
and towards the end of this calendar
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
year the first round of it upgrades will
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
go live
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
by next summer we anticipate launching
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
the direct bill so meeting the
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
compliance for the conflict of interest
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
and submitting the waiver application to
 
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
and submitting the waiver application to
cms

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
cms
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
so so far our system work is on track
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
with our calendar and we appreciate your
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
support while making these changes to
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
benefit our families and individuals so
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
mercedes you've only been here a couple
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
of months and yet we see such great

progress keep it up thank you very much
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
senator guida
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
with a question thank you mr chair um in
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
your stakeholder group
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
is the brain and spinal cord injury
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
association incorporated therein
 
01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.350 align:start position:0%
association incorporated therein
um

01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
trying to think of our members we have
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
our members posted on our website um
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
right we also have uh self advocates and
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
family members um i would have to check
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
specifically i would ask that you
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
incorporate them because that is a that
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
is a population that has some dreadful
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
needs that are absolutely yeah yeah
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.229 align:start position:0%
thank you
although

01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
i do have to say a number of those
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
individuals are served under the choices
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
for independence waiver and not
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily the developmental services
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
and individual
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
so we've really focused on those
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
populations in terms of most of the
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
steering committee
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i do have a few
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions if i could
 
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.590 align:start position:0%
questions if i could
um

01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
specifically you i think you mentioned
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
that you would be doing individualized
 
01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.350 align:start position:0%
that you would be doing individualized
rates

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
for services
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:26:31.199 --> 01:26:33.030 align:start position:0%
would that
encourage

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
a provider to cherry pick
 
01:26:36.719 --> 01:26:37.830 align:start position:0%
a provider to cherry pick
the

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
clients that have the highest
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
so if if
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know a home visit
 
01:26:52.639 --> 01:26:54.149 align:start position:0%
i don't know a home visit
is

01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
eight dollars for one client and twelve
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
dollars for another client why wouldn't
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.070 align:start position:0%
the provider
uh

01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
show preference to the higher rate
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
client well it's the it's not that the
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
individual rate will be different it's
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
the if you will menu of services
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately that's provided to the client
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
that will be different in terms of the
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
level of support
 
01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.790 align:start position:0%
level of support
so

01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
the one correlation is more that the
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
person who has the higher intensity
 
01:27:28.159 --> 01:27:29.110 align:start position:0%
person who has the higher intensity
needs

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
issues

01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
will have a higher budget because
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to need a broader variety
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
of services to support them in the
 
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.910 align:start position:0%
of services to support them in the
community

01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
so that's more the reality i must have
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
understood what you
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
incorrectly what you said
 
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.229 align:start position:0%
incorrectly what you said
um

01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
i know you've said to us
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i've
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
seen it reported that while you want to
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
improve rates
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
you don't you won't be cutting services
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
but you don't expect
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
the budget the full budget that we need
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
to appropriate for to increase
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand how that
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
is going to work mathematically
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
how are we not going to see
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
a higher total
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
program cost
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
if we increase rates and don't cut
 
01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.950 align:start position:0%
if we increase rates and don't cut
services

01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think part of the work here is that
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's premature to speculate about that
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
at this point um as you know in going
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
back to the 2016 lba audit but so going
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
forward we've had
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
unexpended funds
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
in that area for a variety of reasons
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
but quite frankly
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
with the challenge of the it systems
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
being unable to clearly get an accurate
 
01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:00.870 align:start position:0%
being unable to clearly get an accurate
picture

01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
um as to what the expenditures are and
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
what's being
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
provided to clients um it's it's um
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
challenging to to scope that out
 
01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.709 align:start position:0%
challenging to to scope that out
so

01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
statement to uh clients is that um at at
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
this point in time we are not changing
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
their um
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
care plans um and the reason i say at
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
this point in time is because one of the
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
things that's working um under this
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
waiver is looking at are there some
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
other types of services that should be
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
identified and developed and be part of
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
the menu that currently we don't have
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
and some of that is in particular in our
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
housing options where we need to get
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
much more creative as to what community
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
housing looks like
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
just as an example
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
but in looking at that
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the rate structure that we're doing
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
i mean we do need to make sure that the
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
true cost of care are getting closer to
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rates i mean we have
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
to be committed to that if we're ever
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
going to achieve quality um but all of
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
those things are the work that we're
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
doing but i think it's really premature
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
at this point senator to say whether or
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
not the funding that's currently in the
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
service system is sufficient or not to
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
do what we want to do
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is we've got to do
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
this work in order to get our hands
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
around it so
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is we might be looking
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
at a more expensive program
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the next budget or the budget after
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
that or not i'm not saying that
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
definitively at this point at all it's i
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
think again it's too it's premature um
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
to have an answer to that until we get
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
these systems up and running and we get
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
a better handle on it or perhaps we just
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
want lapse funds
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we've exactly
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
but i think the other significant piece
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
is bringing home the folks who are
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment needs and developing
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
those resources here in new hampshire
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
that alone will be much more efficient
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
from a financial standpoint let alone a
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
quality of care standpoint
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and um if if i could miss
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
church you're on a roll senator go for
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
it i have some correspondence
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
um from march
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the developmental services quality
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
council which is
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislatively charged with
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
looking over
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
our dd system to make sure
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
that that it's good
 
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.830 align:start position:0%
that that it's good
and

01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
they have expressed
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
a number of concerns
 
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.590 align:start position:0%
a number of concerns
with

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
approach towards transparency of the
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
work that's being done
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the areas of
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
the waiver development and redesign the
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
budget and funding
 
01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
budget and funding
and

01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
the department's ability to help clients
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
seek employment
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
the last letter they sent to the
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
department was stated march 16th
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
has the department responded to that
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
letter in
 
01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.470 align:start position:0%
letter in
either

01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
generally or in detail to the areas of
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
concern or if not when
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
yes in in both ways one we are actively
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
engaged with the quality council
 
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
engaged with the quality council
interestingly

01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me many members of the quality
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
council are also on the advisory
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
committee for the alvarez and marcel
 
01:32:40.719 --> 01:32:42.070 align:start position:0%
committee for the alvarez and marcel
work

01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
and a number of those members were
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
actually part of the governor's
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
commission report
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
going back in 2020 where they
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
specifically said and recognized as a
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
group that we needed to
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
look at hiring a consultant
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
to modernize the service system for
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
developmental services
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
we have self-advocates on that and
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
family members we are
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
very respectful
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
of their comments and recommendations we
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a very long list of frequently
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
asked questions that's on the website
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
there is a dedicated website for
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
information and transparency
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
all of
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
the meetings are on
 
01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.350 align:start position:0%
the meetings are on
zoom

01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.229 align:start position:0%
zoom
and

01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
you can certainly look at those the
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
transcripts are on
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
line as well as i stated i think before
 
01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.229 align:start position:0%
line as well as i stated i think before
um

01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
we i believe have been exhaustive um in
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
being transparent and and involving
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
people as much as possible uh in this
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
process but as i also stated earlier
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
change is hard
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
and change is going to
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
produce a lot of concerns and we try to
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
address them and take them into account
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
but we also need to move forward with
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
this work
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
if i could just

who are served by the system
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i just would encourage the
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
department to
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.870 align:start position:0%
listen to their concerns and respond to
them

01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
and we do senator
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
we do actively engage with the quality
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
council in addition to all of the other
 
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
council in addition to all of the other
groups

01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
melissa and
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
cindy hunt who's the bureau chief for
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
developmental services was on vacation
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why she's not here
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
are about to begin a series of in-person
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%

01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:06.470 align:start position:0%
meetings with all of the family support
councils

01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
councils
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
connected to the area agencies so
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of outreach
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
and transparency that's going on in this
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
project i'm really glad to hear that
 
01:35:14.719 --> 01:35:15.830 align:start position:0%
project i'm really glad to hear that
because

01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
this is an important constituency for
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
all of us no question and
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
from what i hear they're not happy
 
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.750 align:start position:0%
from what i hear they're not happy
so

01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
i hope you will
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
continue to listen to them and to
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%

acquired brain disorder weightless
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
quarterly report with sandy hunt melissa
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%

01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards uh thank you
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i i i think if you're gonna
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
use this uh timeline slide the on slide
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
four so there's you got a minor typo
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
there you wanna clean up the the last
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
group under the timeline says june 22 at
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
the far right
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
at that is probably 23. it is thank you
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's not why i mentioned
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
it though uh what what i was looking at
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
is that your sk it looks like you're
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
planning to submit the cms waiver
 
01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.229 align:start position:0%
planning to submit the cms waiver
application

01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of wanting the the pilot
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
project to go live
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
to switch from being a pilot to a go
 
01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.189 align:start position:0%
to switch from being a pilot to a go
live

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious about
 
01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.790 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious about
how

01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
is that cutting it too close or is that
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
the normal amount of time
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
before you would want to submit a cms
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
waiver before wanting to go live with
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
they're um related but somewhat separate
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
in that one is the billing process which
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
continues anyways
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then the waiver
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
permission is a separate process with
 
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.270 align:start position:0%
permission is a separate process with
cms

01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
cms
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
does that make sense uh it probably does
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
to somebody who knows more about it i'm
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
just i'm just looking at this critical
 
01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.310 align:start position:0%
just i'm just looking at this critical
date

01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
doing a uh taking your pilot direct bill
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
project to full go live at the start of
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
fy24 which is july one right
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
and so then when i look up and i say
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
submit a cms waiver application i'm just
 
01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:29.430 align:start position:0%
submit a cms waiver application i'm just
curious

01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
curious
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
to what extent the the
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
the go live is dependent upon that
 
01:37:34.159 --> 01:37:35.350 align:start position:0%
the go live is dependent upon that
waiver

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
it is not all right and then i'm sure
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
you got a risk mitigation plan under all
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
of this what how how confident are you
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be able to hit one
 
01:37:44.239 --> 01:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be able to hit one
july

01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
july
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
well given all the risks that you're
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
we are extremely optimistic that we can
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
hit this
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
we must
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
for the direct bill component
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
the waiver aspect
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
do that as well it's a matter of
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
things like getting the contract out for
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
doing the cis assessments with the local
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
group and those things that
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
as you say
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
can hold things up but we are very
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
optimistic that we will hit this all
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
right well thank you good luck
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
one question anyway um i've done a fair
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
bit of work with area agencies nine and
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
ten and through that got to know
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
jonathan roulard who has moved on um who
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
is this replacement
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's an interim uh at this point it's
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
ellen mcmahon okay is filling in as the
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
interim for the um community support
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
network thank you
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and just just
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
to connect a few dots here um counselor
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
edwards we passed a bill yesterday and
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
i defended it from the floor
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
rather than just spending a bunch of
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
money on something we're not familiar
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
with there is a pilot project
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
that will be assessed
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
um to see how well it works and to see
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
that it is of course quite cost
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
effective i don't remember the numbers i
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
just walked up there and said that um
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
if you know what i mean and he probably
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
knows more than what about what i mean
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
than i know uh could you say more about
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.040 --> 01:40:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
eighteen

01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
um so this uh bill 430 is for the 18 to
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
21 and a half year olds who currently
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
the gap right from school service to
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
developmental services right so we agree
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
um you know looking at a clubhouse model
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps for these folks as far as you
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
know getting them the services and
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
assessment that they need
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
and filling the gap between school and
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
the waiver program so we're really
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
and say a little bit more about that
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
program um i i don't know much about it
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay but i can certainly um get you more
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
information on it um
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we know it's an
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
important gap in service that we want to
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
see you know what works as far as the
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
pilot and what would be cost efficient
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
for the state to get these folks the
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
services that they need that's about the
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
first thing i heard when i started
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
working with dd several years ago is
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
that gap
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm so glad to see that
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
we passed 4 30 and i hope in the uh
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference reconciling our
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
version with the senate's version
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
that one had better stay in we hope so

the board was very active in 2021 they
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
met 10 times both remotely due to covet
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
and in person once that option became
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
viable uh the first half of the year
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
they spent focused on legislative
 
01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
they spent focused on legislative
initiatives

01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
the board supported legislative efforts
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
to add qualifying medical conditions to
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
the statutory list
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
they based their recommendations on a
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
deep dive into the available medical and
 
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
scientific literature related to these
 
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.510 align:start position:0%
scientific literature related to these
conditions

01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
and the bills and the conditions that
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
were added that they recommend adding
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
were insomnia
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder with specific
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
guard rails related to patient age
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
and opioid use disorder again with
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
specific guard rails based on the
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
medical specialties that could certify
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
for that condition so those were hp 89
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
and hb 605.
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
the board also supported legislative
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
initiatives related to providing more
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
education related to the therapeutic use
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
of cannabis including the risk of
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis use during pregnancy and while
 
01:43:16.159 --> 01:43:17.590 align:start position:0%
cannabis use during pregnancy and while
breastfeeding

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the risk of cannabis use in
 
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.750 align:start position:0%
and the risk of cannabis use in

01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
adolescents
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
the board supported a legislative effort
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
to require the atcs that stands for
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center that is the
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
name of that the
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire gives to the cannabis
 
01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:34.790 align:start position:0%
new hampshire gives to the cannabis
dispensaries

01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
dispensaries
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
to add the cultivar strain name to the
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
labels and other public facing documents
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
like like menus
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
prior to that they were required by
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
state regulation our rules to only use
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh abbreviations which became very
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
complex for the
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
patients to to do their own research on
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
cultivar um
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
effects if you will
 
01:43:58.239 --> 01:43:59.830 align:start position:0%
effects if you will
um

01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
lastly the board supported a legislative
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
effort to uh actually i just read that
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
one so all those initial initiatives
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
were passed into law
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
so other work of the board in 2021
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
they continue to actively work on
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
provider education documents including
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
clinical best practices for medical
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
providers to consider and follow when
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
certifying patients for therapeutic
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis as well as education related to
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
specific populations
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy adolescence and substance use
 
01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.910 align:start position:0%

disorder

01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
in addition the board reviewed the
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
requirements for the analytic testing of
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh for cannabinoids and
 
01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.510 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh for cannabinoids and
contaminants

01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
they support efforts to update the
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
testing standards in the department's
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
rules to create efficiencies reduce
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
administrative burden and lower cost to
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
the atcs without sacrificing patient
 
01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.709 align:start position:0%
the atcs without sacrificing patient
safety

01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
the board reviewed the atc's labeling
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
and packaging requirements and made
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations the board reviewed the
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
atc's educational materials and made
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations and many of these
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations have already been
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
a theme of this year's work for the
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
board has been a focus on the patient
 
01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
board has been a focus on the patient
experience

01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
the board has considered throughout this
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
past year issues affecting the state's
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients issues
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
like cost of product product
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
availability accessibility
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
barriers to certification
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
employment issues among others
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
in fact the board unanimously voted to
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
engage in efforts to reduce the stigma
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis use
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
though to date specific activities for
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
this engagement have not been not yet
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
been identified or put into practice
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
this work did culminate in december of
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
this past year um when the board hosted
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
an advertised public in-person and
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
remote listening session to hear from
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
patients caregivers medical providers an
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
interested member of the public
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
about the issues that uh that that are
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
facing patients in new hampshire uh it
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
was well attended considering the winter
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
and um covid about 50 people
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
participated um and the board plans in
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
2022 to consider how it can engage to
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
support patients relative to the issues
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
they face
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%

01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
really regarding your experience and
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
wisdom that has a speculative uh
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion at the end i appreciate the
 
01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.070 align:start position:0%
conclusion at the end i appreciate the
preface

01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
preface
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
we we um
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
are watching other states legalize
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
this would empower
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
users of therapeutic cannabis
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
to enter the recreational market
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
to self-medicate
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what impact that is
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
having in those states on the atcs
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
that exist there and what that might
 
01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.709 align:start position:0%
that exist there and what that might
imply

01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
imply
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
were we at some point in the future
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
to legalize recreational cannabis
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
can you speculate on that for me
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh of course i can
 
01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:45.430 align:start position:0%
yes uh of course i can
um

01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
every state
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
that has legalized adult use
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
except for one has been able to maintain
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
the viability of their therapeutic
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis programs
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
in general
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
every state however has experienced a
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
decrease in the number of patients who
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
are registered in those medical programs
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
for exactly those reasons that you say
 
01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:12.709 align:start position:0%
for exactly those reasons that you say
um

01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
if it is legal then
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
why go through the administrative hoops
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
to register with the state talk to your
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
doctor when you can just go to a store
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
and purchase cannabis and and
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
the importance of maintaining a
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program is is clear it
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
serves patients that are under 21 years
 
01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.149 align:start position:0%
serves patients that are under 21 years
old

01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
there are robust education
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
materials to on on dosages
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
what products work best for others there
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
are different products available which
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
target medical uses including cbd uh
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
products low thc products and cbd thc
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
ratio products um etc so there's a
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
and also there's there's a value for
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
medical programs in that they typically
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
have um a higher potency limit which is
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
needed for certain patients um than
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
adult use programs so
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
those principles apply the
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
the big the biggest factor probably
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
though is that other um
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
all other states that have legalized
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
have created a high tax model um and and
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that means medical cannabis is
 
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.629 align:start position:0%
so that means medical cannabis is
typically

01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
less expensive than recreational
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis and so
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
under the um because of that those
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
policy decisions
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the medical programs are can be
 
01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.669 align:start position:0%
the uh the medical programs are can be
sustainable

01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
now you know
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
15 household 1598 which just got a
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
hearing in
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
senate ways and means um yesterday two
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
days ago
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
that bill proposed a model that would
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
not have taxed uh therapy recreational
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis um and so the department was
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
very concerned that uh that that model
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
would undermine the um the therapeutic
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis model um
 
01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.830 align:start position:0%
cannabis model um
so

01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah so in conclusion the
 
01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.510 align:start position:0%
so yeah so in conclusion the
the

01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
other states have been able to maintain
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
them um there is a model for
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis that would allow
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
for the viability of a therapeutic
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and
 
01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:21.109 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and
hopefully

01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
if and when
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire moves into that that space
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
we can successfully maintain the
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr holt i sought your wisdom
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
and you delivered perfectly uh thanks
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
for the work that you do
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative marsh yes thank you mr
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
chairman mr holt i just wanted to thank
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
the board for its work developing the
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
warning posters and pamphlets which you
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
worked on this last year uh and uh to
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
point out that those were intended from
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
the beginning to be more widely used
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
should new hampshire ever legalize
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
recreational campus
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i noticed your
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
amendment in house bill 1598 allow the
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
liquor commission to use the materials
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
this is a more general concern follow-up
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
on what representative salloway was
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
asking as i'm as i'm looking at the the
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
charter and the members
 
01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.390 align:start position:0%
charter and the members
um

01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
i start to wonder
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
who we should be turning to routinely as
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
a legislature when we're concerned about
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
the longer term financial or economic
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
viability of the atcs i i've been
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
concerned for years i think you've and i
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
have talked about it uh about the
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
atc model under their current structure
 
01:51:42.159 --> 01:51:44.310 align:start position:0%
atc model under their current structure
um

01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
who or which group or is there anyone
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
chartered with uh officially assessing
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
and coming up with a
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
one year to five year sort of this is
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
where it looks like we're going
 
01:51:57.679 --> 01:52:00.470 align:start position:0%
where it looks like we're going
economically

01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
economically
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative there is not a an entity
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
that is in charge of that there are
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
three licensed atc's um they are
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
required by state law to be
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit entities which is a
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
severe challenge
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
to their their business model their
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
ability to reinvest in their companies
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
and make improvements including lowering
 
01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:24.149 align:start position:0%
and make improvements including lowering
cost

01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
over the past several years legislation
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
introduced that would remove the
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
requirement or allow the atcs to convert
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
to for-profit entities
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
like has happened in
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
most of the states that at first
 
01:52:41.599 --> 01:52:43.270 align:start position:0%
most of the states that at first
required

01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis dispensaries to
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
adopt a for-profit model and to date
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
those legislative efforts have stalled
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
um in fact senate bill 38 this from the
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
201 2021 session
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
passed the senate
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
passed the house
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
was vetoed by the governor for the
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
second time
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
was overturned
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
in um this uh the veto override was uh
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh successful in the senate um and the
 
01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.790 align:start position:0%
uh successful in the senate um and the
bill

01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
um lost by 13 votes in the house
 
01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.510 align:start position:0%
um lost by 13 votes in the house
that

01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
would uh would let me sleep better at
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
night regarding their viability
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
but to your question there there's no
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
entity that is that is looking at their
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
viability um besides uh besides the
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
entities themselves and as the you know
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
as the as the entity that's
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
required to regulate them uh i'm i'm
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
concerned i'm concerned if uh that they
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't allow they can't get to be
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
for-profit and i'd be concerned with the
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
well follow up okay so so i i hear you
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
saying that my my concern is is not just
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
paranoia that that given that we're
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
rolling getting if we roll it out it is
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
going to be a no tax or a low tax
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh recreational pot bill
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
that that does present a competitive
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
challenge to our atc model
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
which threatens their economic viability
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that there's
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
no one group that's responsible for
 
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.310 align:start position:0%
no one group that's responsible for
assessing

01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
the economic viability of the medical
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the united in new hampshire
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and as a result we're flying a
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
little bit blind
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that that's my summary is that is
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
that accurate 1598
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
inf actually included a provision that
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
would have required
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission to directly
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
compete with the atcs not just benign
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
neglect you know it had a provision that
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
said it shall be the duty of the liquor
 
01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.629 align:start position:0%
said it shall be the duty of the liquor
commission

01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
to sell cannabis for therapeutic
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis for therapeutic use
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
we are uh
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic so in addition the
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis law
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
um requires that there be four licensed
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
atc's if one of them were to uh go out
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
of business the department would be
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
issue an rfp
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
basically put that license out to bid
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
so certainly we would have quite a bit
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
of work to do in order to fill that gap
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
if one of the atc's decided to cease
 
01:55:30.639 --> 01:55:34.310 align:start position:0%
if one of the atc's decided to cease
operations

01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative abrami made a
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
strong recommendation that any
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
legalization effort in the state would
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
have a specific pathway for the atcs to
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
to be engaged in um adult use
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
legalization 1598 did not have that it
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
had an allowance that they could create
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
a separate
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
for-profit entity and apply just like
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
so i know i'm not answering your
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
question directly but these are the
 
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.950 align:start position:0%
question directly but these are the
issues

01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
i just don't know how to help you if we
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't get the right information at the
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
right times from the right group of
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
people to the right people
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
when when discussing the impacts of 1598
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
to with the atc's um i mean the
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
the question the question i ask is you
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
know at what number like what what
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
number of patients do you need and
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
to to remain viable
 
01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.870 align:start position:0%
to to remain viable
and

01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to try to stay viable for
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
as long as they can but if they would if
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
the number of patients is reduced
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
to remain viable they have to increase
 
01:56:48.639 --> 01:56:49.669 align:start position:0%
to remain viable they have to increase
prices

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
prices
 
01:56:49.679 --> 01:56:50.870 align:start position:0%
prices
um

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
one of the issues is that
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
there's 13 000 patients that they can
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
serve in the state
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
um not not a lot to make you know these
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
businesses uh viable uh more patients
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
means more sales means greater viability
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
um allowing them to be for profit uh
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
means greater viability um the patient
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh is about yeah about 13 000 patients
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
right now it hasn't grown this past year
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
it had you know between 2020 you know
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
2021 2022 um the patient growth has
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
stabilized um
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what the solution is
 
01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.229 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what the solution is
um

01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
except for ones that have already been
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
tried which are to allow them to convert
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
to for-profit entities
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
there is not a bill this session that
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
sing no further hands up thank you mr
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
