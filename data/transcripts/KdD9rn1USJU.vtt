00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
buck and we're going to start the
 
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting subcommittee
 
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
meeting on House Bill 655.
 
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 align:start position:0%
so as a result of the hearing that we
 
00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.310 align:start position:0%
so as a result of the hearing that we
had

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
this week it seemed that there was a
 
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
concern for the disciplinary portion of
 
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here that would like to
 
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
speak about something other than that
 
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes would you like to come to the
 
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Elizabeth Robb I'm a
 
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
practicing licensed acupuncturist in
 
00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and as I was
 
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
reading through the bill I answered my
 
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
own questions from the other day but um
 
00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
I noticed that a number of boards
 
00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:41.630 align:start position:0%
I noticed that a number of boards
um

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
it says that they'll receive a license
 
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
board is crossed out and it's replaced
 
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
with office but that's not the case with
 
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
the licensed acupuncturists and I was
 
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
hoping that we could just keep things
 
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
consistent if the naturopaths and the
 
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals and the
 
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacy interns are going to get their
 
00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
applications reviewed by the office then
 
00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
just put the acupuncturers licenses
 
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
applications under that also just keep
 
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's that makes sense to me does
 
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
anybody have any comments on that
 
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
no okay okay we'll put that in the
 
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.930 align:start position:0%
no okay okay we'll put that in the
amendment

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson sent us written
 
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
testimony but if you'd like to speak for
 
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
a few minutes
 
00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh for the record
 
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 align:start position:0%
Mark Pearson among other things I chair
 
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
DHHS oversight committee
 
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and that's kind of the relevance of
 
00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
why I'm here after the Boston globe's
 
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
Spotlight team
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh did a lengthy lengthy series of
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
articles about a surgeon practicing in
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 align:start position:0%
it mentioned that there were 20
 
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements against that
 
00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
surgeon posted on the Board of Medicine
 
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
site in Massachusetts with zero On The
 
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine site in New Hampshire
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
so I immediately cranked up a
 
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of
 
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
oversight to start looking into this
 
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
bringing together stakeholders from the
 
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the medical society
 
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals nurses in the various groups
 
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
oplc and with that in mind there's a few
 
00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 align:start position:0%
things I wish to comment on in house
 
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill 655. first of all on page five
 
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 align:start position:0%
lines 10 to 14. it gives to oplc
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
some non-lapsing funds which will give
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to move immediately
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
my subcommittee of oversight did not
 
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
find fault with the individual from the
 
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine who is doing
 
00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 align:start position:0%
investigations what we did find is this
 
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 align:start position:0%
was a retired individual working without
 
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
compensation very much part-time the
 
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
problem is not this gentleman the
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
problem is there were not enough of them
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
and if oplc at that point had monies
 
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
that they could use that could have been
 
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
rectified almost immediately absent that
 
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
we are still not doing the kind of work
 
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
we felt the subcommittees felt everybody
 
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to be done so that's Point number
 
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.610 align:start position:0%
wanted to be done so that's Point number
one

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh points number two is it mentions in
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
the bill that
 
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
um the executive director of oplc will
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
be working up various protocols that
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine will follow in the
 
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
various investigations this too is
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
something our subcommittee worked on and
 
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
in recent conversation with Lindsay
 
00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.590 align:start position:0%
in recent conversation with Lindsay
Courtney

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
Courtney
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe she welcomes the
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's continued work in other
 
00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
words let us work with her everyone
 
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
seems to be happy we've got this the
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
group together and together we can go
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
forward to make recommendations to her
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the board
 
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
and then my final Point
 
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.790 align:start position:0%
and then my final Point
um

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
is Page 19.
 
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.350 align:start position:0%
is Page 19.
[Music]

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.730 align:start position:0%
[Music]
uh

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh and go down around verse yeah verse
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
line 22. and following and on to the
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
next page it speaks of requirements for
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
dentists using anesthesia
 
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
I read this over recently I was at the
 
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
Delta Dental event and had opportunity
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
to speak with a number of dentists and
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
it does not seem that what is in here is
 
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily wrong my question is should
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
it be in here
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
and why I say that is formally I chaired
 
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services Committee
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
of the house and whenever we had a bill
 
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
that told doctors how to practice
 
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
medicine we routinely unanimously it
 
00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
yelled it because that is not the job of
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature is to put it into law
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
first of all Let The Board of Medicine
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
and the medical societies come up with
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
those protocols if there's egregious
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
mistakes we can deal with that but let
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
the professionals come up with it
 
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.689 align:start position:0%
the professionals come up with it
secondly

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
Whenever there seems to be a change in
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
the law it is because there are new best
 
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
practices well what happens if two years
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
from now there's new best practices
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
again well we're stuck with this law
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
saying what best practices are
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
so rather than going through the whole
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
lengthy procedure of a bill to change
 
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 align:start position:0%
the best practices
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to my former committee that the
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
medical boards medical societies could
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
make those changes in protocols in other
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
words this may well be good stuff here
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
in the bill it just doesn't belong in
 
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
the bill regulation of medical groups
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
Dental groups should not be in
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation to say exactly who should be
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
in the room at what point that should be
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
the job of the societies of
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
professionals so with that that's my
 
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning and thank you
 
00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone have any questions
 
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
and this is sort of an informal meeting
 
00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 align:start position:0%
so anybody can
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
pop their hand up if they have a
 
00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:30.350 align:start position:0%
pop their hand up if they have a
question

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
nope okay thank you so thank you for
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
other than the disciplinary election I
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
have two questions on page 12.
 
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
line 10. it talks about that the um the
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
boards can enjoin
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
someone from doing something an
 
00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
injunction without bond is available to
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry can you it was Paige page
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
12 page 12 line 10. thank you
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
oh yes I see
 
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.249 align:start position:0%
oh yes I see
so

00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of uh experience with
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
injunction bonds and I just didn't I'm
 
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
injunction bonds and I just didn't I'm
curious

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.469 align:start position:0%
curious
um

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
I consider this the Executive Branch the
 
00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:24.890 align:start position:0%
I consider this the Executive Branch the
oplc

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
says the executive branch override the
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
judicial Branch's requirement to have
 
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
injunction Bond relief
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
so what happens is if I join you and I
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
tell you to stop doing something the
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
court will say well what happens it will
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
if you're wrong in requesting this
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
injunction against you
 
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
and it's going to I tell you you can't
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
sell your widget because it has a logo
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
that I think is mine so I am join you
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
for two months from selling your widget
 
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
and if I'm wrong
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
you've lost two months of Revenue I have
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
to post a bond equal to what we think
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
that or what the judge determines that
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
revenue is going to be and I end up
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
having to if I lose I end up having
 
00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
caused you harm and I have to either pay
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
that amount or the bond will pay the
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
amount so I'm confused as to how a
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
junction without bond is available to to
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
I think representative Courtney has an
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
answer for that so she could and um you
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
want to talk about okay you can point to
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
both of them at the same time the other
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
one and the other the other point I'd
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
like to make is line 20 through line I
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
36 this has to do with the oversight
 
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.509 align:start position:0%
36 this has to do with the oversight
committee

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
um I sit as a as a chairman of the labor
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee I sit on the Employment
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
Securities Advisory Board we meet
 
00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019 align:start position:0%
quarterly and we go over everything
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's going on with Employment
 
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.290 align:start position:0%
that's going on with Employment
Securities

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
Securities
 
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh unemployment here in the state and it
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
is made up of two members of Labor uh
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
member of business uh one Senator one
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative and a few members of the
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh one member of the public and
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
a member of the Employment Securities
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
advisory or Employment Securities staff
 
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.889 align:start position:0%
advisory or Employment Securities staff
having

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
three members of the house and two
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate I don't think
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
would be as effective as if you had
 
00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:17.459 align:start position:0%
possibly one member from the oplc and
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
possibly two members whether you know
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
from one of the each of of two boards
 
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:26.060 align:start position:0%
um I think it gives you a better idea of
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
what's going on and you can hear from
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
all different sides it seems to be
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
effective Employment Securities Advisory
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
Board and
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
first of all trying to find two members
 
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:38.420 align:start position:0%
of the Senate good luck
 
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
of the Senate good luck
so

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
those are my comments
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative I mean Miss Courtney can
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
you answer representative dad's question
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll make a note on the other
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely thank you
 
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.030 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely thank you
um

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
over the record in Lindsey Corner
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
executive director PLC with respect to
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
the bond that language is consistent
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
with language that exists in other
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
practice acts practically that that is
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
also how it works when the state seeks
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
to enjoin Behavior I can tell you from
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
my personal experience representing DHHS
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Justice we
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
regularly were able to seek and obtain
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
injunctions without a bond practically I
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
think the the reason for that is one the
 
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
state has immunity it's that private
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
parties don't have with respect to
 
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
parties don't have with respect to
um

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
loss recoveries and and secondly
 
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.690 align:start position:0%
loss recoveries and and secondly
um

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
requirement to put up a bond obviously
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
has an impact on funds state funds and
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
um so I think that those are really the
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
two policy bases uh for why
 
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
um State entities are not required to
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
put up a bond I don't I'm not taking a
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
position either way whether that should
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
be the case but I did just want to let
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know that that's pretty consistent
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that wants to speak
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
about something other than disciplinary
 
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.350 align:start position:0%
about something other than disciplinary
action

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.550 align:start position:0%
action
okay

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
so then it's all about disciplinary
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
action right now
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
um does someone want to start the
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
conversation on that representative yes
 
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:32.050 align:start position:0%
conversation on that representative yes
please

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee my name is John dejoy and
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here today representing the National
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
Association of Social Workers the New
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chapter as well as the New
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychological Association
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the National Association of Social
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
Workers is requesting one addition that
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
is consistent with one of the
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
psychologists Edition as well and that
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
is in regard to the subject matter
 
00:12:59.530 --> 00:12:59.540 align:start position:0%
experts relative to the investigations
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
we my client believes that subject
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
matter experts should always be of a
 
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
comparable licensure level and practice
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
background of the person that they're
 
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.290 align:start position:0%
background of the person that they're
investigating

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
we don't see that in the statute and
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
would request that that be added in
 
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.990 align:start position:0%
would request that that be added in
rulemaking

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
that is also a concern of the
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
psychologist but the psychologists have
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
a few other concerns that I'd like to
 
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.389 align:start position:0%
a few other concerns that I'd like to
outline

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
relative to the some of the terms of
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
allegations and complaint
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
they are different from the terms that
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
folks are using today
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
or that folks are comfortable with and
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Practical implication of that is
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
when psychologists recertify or
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
re-license they have to acknowledge if
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
they have any current disciplinary
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
action or it's often called complaints
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
or investigations so our request would
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
be that regarding the terms of
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
allegations complaint investigation that
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
they be added to a definition section so
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're all understanding specifically
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
so you're asking for a definition of
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
allegation complaints and investigations
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
just so so that they can determine for
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
licensure and insurance purposes what
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative fuel has a question sorry
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
if that we
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
have that suggestion do you have uh
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
you have drafted a language that we
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
could put in I do not I could probably
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
model something together but I believe
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
director Courtney probably has more
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
specific language that she could share I
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
haven't I've talked to her I haven't
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
talked to her about this issue but I
 
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
would imagine she has language she could
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
relative to privacy and and my clients
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
testified regarding this the other day
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
there are concerns around privacy of
 
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.329 align:start position:0%
there are concerns around privacy of
Records

00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
Records
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
in the current in the current RSA there
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
are clear protections of re-release of
 
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:14.420 align:start position:0%
of client records that are
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
retained as a result of Investigation
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
it it is unclear whether the language is
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the current bill and if it is we've
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
missed it and so let me give you a
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
practical explanation of what our
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
concern is I mean 91a is covered very
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
well that the records are maintained
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
relative to 91a
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
but as part of Investigation if I'm a
 
00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:38.459 align:start position:0%
psychologist and records are received
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
the way the bill reads it is not clear
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether oplc could re-release those
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
records to another party
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
it is our belief that anytime client
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
records are used despite an
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
investigation they should never be
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
re-released to a third party
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
without proper court order to do so
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
so we would just like clarification that
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
the records that are maintained as part
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the investigation are not available
 
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the final request is that
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health and the board
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
of psychology currently have a different
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedure than many of the
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
other boards
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry do they have similar
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
procedures and those two procedures okay
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
those two procedures are different the
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
social workers are quite comfortable
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the um the
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
procedures as outlined in the bill
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
the psychologists are requesting to
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
maintain their existing disciplinary
 
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.829 align:start position:0%
maintain their existing disciplinary
procedure

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
now I can try to give you my best
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of what that looks like
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
ostensibly and I think there's other
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
people here who can probably explain it
 
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
better ostensibly it is a process within
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
the board where there are several
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
psychologists who are investigated or
 
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.949 align:start position:0%
psychologists who are investigated or
investigators

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:10.549 align:start position:0%
investigators
um

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
there is a liaison between the board and
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
the oplc and investigators are assigned
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
by that liaison from within that pool of
 
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:20.809 align:start position:0%
by that liaison from within that pool of
of

00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
um subject matter experts they provide
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
findings of of their investigation to
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little bit different because
 
00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:36.419 align:start position:0%
it's a process within the board
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
structure as opposed to
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
um within oplc and working with the
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
board and that's the
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's what I have to
 
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.570 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's what I have to
cover

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay Madam chair I apologize oh one last
 
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
the last thing that I would mention is
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
in in the the fines and and fees section
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
there is an uncapped potential for
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
um reimbursement for investigative costs
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
my clients believe that that should not
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
be in infinite it should have some cap
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
greetings I'm Dr Deborah Warner I'm
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
representing myself my practice Bright
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
Day psychology in Littleton New
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've also well informed
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
about the statutes I was part of the
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
process developing the psychology and
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
the some other Provisions that are in
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
both psychology and board of mental
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
health practice statutes
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
I presented you with a copy I'm sorry I
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
didn't get it over to you of a suggested
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the bill and it does
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
reference that it could be we could
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
rewrite section 22 of our chapter I can
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
give you copies of that as well it's a
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
bit longer but excuse me can you make
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure do you have extra copies there
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
I have
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
could you please give a copy to
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
um Mrs Miss Courtney behind you
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
from oplc
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
and also give a copy to representative
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
I'll give her my copy if you can give me
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh so uh I would suggest that for the
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
psychology uh statute that we make some
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
changes in the first section that gives
 
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
exceptions for override by the chapter
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
pertaining to a receipt of an allegation
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
investigation of a complaint
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
and that's in the first part of my
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
handout the next section section 144 is
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
about criminal records check that we
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
would have if there is if somebody does
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
not clear their criminal record check
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
that that should go before the board
 
00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:29.299 align:start position:0%
it's section 145
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
that the board is the entity issuing the
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
license and not the office and certainly
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
they would delegate many many things to
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
the office to do
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
for automated licenses and such
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
um and in in Roman 2 of that same
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
section uh examinations they was crossed
 
00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:50.510 align:start position:0%
section uh examinations they was crossed
out

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
written oral or both uh that it would be
 
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
retained sometimes when the candidate
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
the applicant fails one of the tests uh
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
they might go through a rewrite but the
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
board does give them another chance by
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
coming in to do an oral and very often
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
they pass I have a question so you're
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
speaking only for yourself I'm speaking
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
only for myself okay thank you
 
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.730 align:start position:0%
only for myself okay thank you
yes

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.590 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:21.620 align:start position:0%
missing from the
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
329b section 15 same at the top of the
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
next page you can see uh they need to
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
add a Roman 3 has passed the criteria
 
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:33.740 align:start position:0%
set forth by the board in its rules
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
somehow rather that's not in there in
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
the law but it is certainly in the rules
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
for the board of psychology
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
and then we get to section 147 where
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's a whole slew of repeals of the
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
psychology sections and
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
um you can see on my
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
lots of red in there
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
um we do not but I do not believe in
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
others I have conferred with uh do not
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
and you have heard Dr Phillips yes the
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
other day as well
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
um that we should not
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
repeal the rules making of the board
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
concerning license procedures or
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
relative to rules regarding complaint
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
procedures that those should remain in
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
the board and they do get help with oplc
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's usually very collaborative in that
 
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
it's usually very collaborative in that
way

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
um it's all right to just repeal the
 
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
establishment of fees
 
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
um I would not see that it's
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
advantageous to
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
um repeal the telepaths license that is
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
a very particular license that's not
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
covered under the new licenses offered
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
by this statute the the changes in this
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
bill the Talia medicine is an out of
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
state entry that is very easy it's
 
00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:51.409 align:start position:0%
state entry that is very easy it's
instantly

00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
instantly
 
00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:52.549 align:start position:0%
instantly
um

00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:22:57.649 --> 00:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
granted you can do it online it as
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
designed it's not yet up and running but
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
somebody if they want to follow a
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
patient into the state who's traveling
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
one of our snowbirds or is a college
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
student that they could be done very
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
very easily and it's an ongoing license
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
it's not just 120 days the current
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
easier one is 120 days and it terminates
 
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
with a application for a full license
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
many people from other states don't want
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
um relative to injunction that's fine to
 
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
repeal in my opinion
 
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
when it comes to RSB 329b20 relative to
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
Temporary and emergency
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
um the the new statutes and as well as
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
this bill do provide for temp licenses
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
but they do not deal with the special
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
thing that we have in our practice our
 
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
specialty is forensic psychologists who
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
come in from other states to do
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
examinations and consultations with the
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
courts those can last longer than 120
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
days and they are often done in
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
sporadically throughout maybe even a
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
two-year period and the language that I
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
put in here would pull from the current
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
statute and keep just the forensic temp
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
license in place that was created
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
because there was much petition
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
we don't need the history we just want
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
your basic comments there you go
 
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.409 align:start position:0%
your basic comments there you go
um

00:24:29.409 --> 00:24:29.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:31.010 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
329 B21 relatively disciplinary action I
 
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
would omit that repeal
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
and then you go to section 22
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
investigations and complaints I did I
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't repeal it but I would also
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
rewrite it I've got a longer version of
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
how I would write it bringing in the
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
language and the wording that goes with
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
what's been put forth in the oplc plan I
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
just must say that I am in favor of
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
getting this all together and having a
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
more coordinated fashion but these are
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
little things that need to go and so
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's it for my my recommendations for
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
my Amendment thank you so much we'll
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
take those into consideration there'll
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
be another follow-up meeting to this so
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
oh we are okay yeah I did have a couple
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
of clarifications of some things that
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
were said earlier should I go in those
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
let's wait on that quickly yes I'd like
 
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
to get to the meat of the matter today
 
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.250 align:start position:0%
to get to the meat of the matter today
okay

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.649 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman with the red tie whose
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning my name is
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
James bommersbach I am the legislative
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
chair for the New Hampshire
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association uh just I
 
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to add a comment in addition to
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
Dr Warner's testimony uh it's my
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that our Psychological
 
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
Association which represents
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
approximately 200 psychologists in the
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
state is also in favor of retaining
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
language that would allow oral
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
examinations as part of the licensing
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
examination we are aware that the
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
current licensing procedures are
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
extensive and and could be beneficial to
 
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
change and I'm happy to have my
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
organization consult with Miss Courtney
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
about making changes to those but the
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining the oral examinations as
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
part of that is important because it
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
allows for an opportunity for someone to
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
on a rare basis not not I don't think
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's used that often but on our basis to
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
allow them to
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate their skills in a way that
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
may not be they may be more favorable or
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
in their interest
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
um so even just a matter of making sure
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
that someone with a learning disability
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
who has difficulty with that kind of
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
essay test or multiple choice tests
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
allowing them to demonstrate their
 
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
skills in an alternative way again this
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
we don't think this happens very often
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
but it would be important not to prevent
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
it from happening
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
it was really good for me to sit here
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
for an hour in the first hearing because
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
I got to hear from some of the other
 
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.930 align:start position:0%
I got to hear from some of the other
boards

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
and my comments are going to be similar
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
to what I stated
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
last week with a few excuse me earlier
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
this week with some caveats I fully
 
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.510 align:start position:0%
this week with some caveats I fully
respect

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
the the job that the oplc is trying to
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
do to organize
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of things all over the
 
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.430 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of things all over the
place

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
I still think there are three different
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
groupings there are construction there
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
are professional and there are health
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
related organizations boards and some of
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
them need to be treated differently and
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
let me explain regarding the hearings
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
because my issues obviously like
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
everybody else a page 20 for the
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
electricians lines 13 through 21
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
repealing them some of these things
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
while I'm in favor of making some
 
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:06.299 align:start position:0%
changes that'll be good for the boards
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the oplc I'm not in favor of
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
repealing them
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
whole in one Lock Stock Barrel
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
we had a hearing the other day
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
we had a hearings officer we had an
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
attorney in the room
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
it was fantastic
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
the hearings officer could swear people
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
in they kept the conversation going when
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
someone went run on question you know
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
get to the question and it kept things
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
going well and I know that with the
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
attorney there with the hearings officer
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
there there was a protocol
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
and if anyone ever complained about what
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
went on there was a clear delineation of
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened who did what and
 
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.070 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened who did what and
when

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
we the members electricians boards could
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
also ask questions
 
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
and of of the the witness if you will
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
and so we could ask questions we can
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
make decisions I feel the oplc wants to
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
make it so we're just the jury we have
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
to sit quietly we don't ask questions
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
and then they have a professional that
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
in essence question uh the witness or
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
the person that may be in trouble with
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't want it to go that way now
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
that may work you heard someone state
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
that we don't have an expert I don't
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
know what that Clinical Psychology thing
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
person does so we need an expert to come
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
in so that would make sense in that case
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
but not all the boards I don't think the
 
00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:26.330 align:start position:0%
but not all the boards I don't think the
um

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
Funeral Directors need another
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
professional funeral director nor the
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
electricians need another professional
 
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.330 align:start position:0%
electricians need another professional
electrician

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
electrician
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
in the room to ask the witness questions
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
so we can then be the jury
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
that may work in some other but I don't
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
believe it does for all
 
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.110 align:start position:0%
believe it does for all
so

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of the rule changes I'd
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
like them to be the protocol that the
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
oplc wants to use but I don't want some
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
of these repeals repeal it repealing the
 
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
of these repeals repeal it repealing the
fees

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
uh the board should clearly and I I I'll
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I was going to do it
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
but I've been up here four times this
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
week I have not studied 319c 6 9 and 12
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
probably as well as I should
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
um we won't hold it against you thank
 
00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:11.510 align:start position:0%
um we won't hold it against you thank
you

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
um but you know there are some things in
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
there about the fees that that we would
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
like still have some authority to do
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
some of the disciplinary actions some of
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
the renewals some of the you know we
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
would like still like to be engaged and
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
have a say in some of these things
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
but we are okay with the oplc having
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
clear Direction and uniformity to many
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
of the things we do
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
but again it can't go overboard we don't
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
need an expert on electric in front of
 
00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:39.110 align:start position:0%
need an expert on electric in front of
three

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
three Master electricians
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
I can't give you line by line Madam
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
chairman what needs to be done
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
um but I would I would rather
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know I like Maize a lot better than
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
I like shells
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
in law when it comes to the executive
 
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:01.100 align:start position:0%
branch and I hope
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
maybe if you're gonna have one more
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
meeting I can give you line by line what
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
things I'm okay with repealing in each
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
one of three six three nineteen C 6 12
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
and 14 and which ones I don't but I just
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
hope you understand what the difference
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
between what I feel the oplc wants to do
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that may be okay for some
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
but not all and I think it would be a
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
waste of time and money in certain
 
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
instances Plus
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
it makes us really mostly ineffective so
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
I think someone who testified before us
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
made a comment that there's the
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
efficiency and cost effectiveness of
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
doing it one way and Justice the other
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's a situation where we want balance
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
right that's right and so maybe
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
we are going to have another
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on this because
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
this is quite
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there's a lot to this
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll take your recommendation
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
to heart as to the different
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
classifications of
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
of a boards because it seems to be
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
there are some boards that are stronger
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
than others
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
so I'll we'll let you know when the next
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
committee meeting and what you said
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me thank you and I and I
 
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.289 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me thank you and I and I
understand

00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
their needs you know what what the the
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
oplc the commissioner wants to do I I in
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
my heart I do maybe it's a little bit of
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
an old-fashioned you know guy who wants
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
to move either slower or doesn't want
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
some of my authority taken away and and
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um where we have to kind of strike that
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
balance but
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
as a legislator as a citizen I realize
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
we have to have some uniformity we
 
00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:58.100 align:start position:0%
cannot expose the state
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
possible Financial you know detriment
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
because it's all over the place
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
correct or the public safety right yes
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much I think it's very
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
concise testimony
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Miss Courtney now
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
she's going to be representative
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
oh wait I can't use that term
 
00:33:25.679 --> 00:33:29.330 align:start position:0%
oh wait I can't use that term
um

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity and I have um our
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
general counsel here to address uh some
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the concerns series because I I share
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
the same goal particularly of the ones
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
that articulated by representative
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
infantine I would suggest so what this
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
statute does is it it's it's a little
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
scary because it repeals a lot of
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
sections but it repeals a lot of
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
sections that are similar and puts it
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
just globally we have
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
um if you put all of our
 
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:04.940 align:start position:0%
statutes in one
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
one document thank you Doug sorry I'm a
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
little tired today so over 800 pages
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
long labor which is a similar agency has
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
less than 25 percent of that and our
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
statutes all say pretty much the same
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
thing but in slightly different ways so
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to see happen is have one
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
statute regarding procedures and one
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
statute regarding licensing as opposed
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
to having to look at 50s plus different
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
statutes it's an administrative
 
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.109 align:start position:0%
statutes it's an administrative
nightmare

00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
nightmare
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
so from a policy standpoint we are
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
certainly open to having
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
um you know amending the language to be
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
different as to how hearings and
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings must be run but
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
we we do think it's necessary to
 
00:34:54.899 --> 00:34:57.109 align:start position:0%
we we do think it's necessary to
basically

00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
strip a lot of these similar statutory
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
Provisions out of the statute so that we
 
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
can provide the best support possible
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
regarding the hearings the
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
it is referenced in 310 the proposed
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
Bill provides for a procedure that it's
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
very similar to how it's run now
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
I didn't see anything in the language
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate a board's ability
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
to ask questions and we would expect
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
that that would continue to occur
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
because they are the subject matter
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
experts I think certainly that language
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
could be firmed up to make that clearer
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we would welcome that change but we
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
we I guess feel pretty strongly that
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have a little bit more of a
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
concise statute for us to look at
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
because it's very it's just very
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
challenging for us to administer
 
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.250 align:start position:0%
challenging for us to administer
um

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
and Doug I'll let you weigh in on the
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
other stuff because I could go on for
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative shuitt has a question
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
hi Miss Courtney uh you said that
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
uh of the repeals some of the things
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
that still need to be in place are put
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
in other places is it possible for you
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
to give us
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know a diagram this is repealed
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
but it's foot here
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
yes we can certainly do a crosswalk for
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
you and bring it to the next meeting or
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully in advance of the next meeting
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
if that would be helpful
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
um because the statute is I mean the
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
bill is huge but there are really only a
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
couple of things that it does which is
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
sets forth a streamlined process for
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
investigations streamline process for
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings and streamline
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
process for licensure but because we
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
have so many statutes
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be big when you repeal
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
that I think that would be helpful and
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
could I just ask a follow-up
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
um I I know you were at the hearing and
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
I think most of the folks here their
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
basic message is one size doesn't fit
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
all so I'm hoping that
 
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
um that's reflected in what you're going
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
to show us in the future yeah I guess I
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
would disagree with that when it comes
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
to procedure when it comes to substance
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
one size does not fit all but when it
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
comes to procedure which is really
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
intended to provide for due process I
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
don't understand why it would be
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
different across the board's procedures
 
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
procedure it's just how you make a
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
decision it's not necessarily the
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
decision that you reach so I would I
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
would disagree with that I I know that
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
um you know several words believe that
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
they are unique in certain circumstances
 
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:50.579 align:start position:0%
I I don't but we agreed to disagree with
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
there seems to be two things going on
 
00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.329 align:start position:0%
there seems to be two things going on
here

00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
you said this is a
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
repeals redundant
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
Pro visions of the law in other words
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's a housekeeping
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
but you're also changing policy
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
you're changing the
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
procedures and the policy that the that
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
says that you're asking us to do
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
could you uh separate those two
 
00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:33.500 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
in some type of a report
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that would explain exactly what are the
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
housekeeping areas and then where are
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
your policy changes and also
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
an organizational chart of the current
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
organization and and what it would look
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
like when if
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
this was passed and also with that
 
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
flow a flow charts or charts
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
that would show us the beginning and the
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
end of every process
 
00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
how it is now and what you're asking us
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
to approve because there's a lot there's
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
this is 76 pages long and there appears
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
to be a lot more in here than just
 
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.770 align:start position:0%
to be a lot more in here than just
housekeeping

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
and and quite and I come out of the out
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
of city government
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
as a city manager if I pre presented
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
this to a city council to throw it back
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
at me
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
because it because you're supposed to
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
help us to understand this
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
and there's not a lot of help here so
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
figure yes so just to be clear this is
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
not an oplc requested bill this bill is
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
a result of recommendations that were
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
put forth by the committee established
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
by Senate bill of 330 last year which we
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
participated in but we did not request
 
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm happy to provide a
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
crosswalk or walk you through what the
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
bill would do with respect to clean up I
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
would submit that we already have the
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
authority over procedures for both
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
licensing and for complaints the problem
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
is we can't have one procedure because
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
every Practice Act has different
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
statutory language in it so it is truly
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
Cleanup in that sense there's also been
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
some statutory conflicts which we've
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
seen with fees we've had fee sending
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
Authority since 2015 and we have not
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
been able to promulgate rules regarding
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
fees because the board practice acts
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
have pertained that and as those have
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
been amended they've superseded our
 
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.050 align:start position:0%
been amended they've superseded our
statutes

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
any type of oplc legislation is going to
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
be large when it's clean up just because
 
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
of the sheer number of statutory
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
Provisions we have and we certainly have
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
debated Nana piecemeal do we not do it
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
piecemeal I think the recommendation out
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
of SB 330 subcommittee
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
um which of course was bipartisan in
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
nature was that this was the way to
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
attack this particular cleanup Bill
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are two other bills that were
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommended by that subcommittee one was
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
concerns the Quorum requirements allows
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
boards to meet remotely we like that
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
idea because I think that would increase
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
participation and the other has to do
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
with the funding mechanism so to
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative infantine's Point earlier
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
we do need a better process for
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
involving the boards with with fee
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
setting Authority and that bill is
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
intended to make sure that we are
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
providing them with allocation
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
budgets and engaging more of a
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
conversation but when you have two
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies that have the same
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
Authority it it doesn't work and what
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
we've seen is that on that those issues
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
for the members of the committee who are
 
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.349 align:start position:0%
for the members of the committee who are
new

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
the study committee that the director is
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
referring to is available online in our
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
statutory and chaptered study committees
 
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:24.260 align:start position:0%
section look at Senate Bill 330 laws of
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
2022 and I will tell you that it's
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
almost as thick as the bill but it's got
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
a complete transcript of those meetings
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked and their
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
final report so I think you might find
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
that helpful in referencing some of the
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
changes that are suggested
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
and representative I'm happy to sit down
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
with you at any time and walk you
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
through it or provide you with any sort
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
of documentation that that that does a
 
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.109 align:start position:0%
of documentation that that that does a
crosswalk

00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
crosswalk
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
um at any time wasn't intending to not
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
be helpful but I wanted to give you the
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
broader picture of the history of this
 
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:08.690 align:start position:0%
broader picture of the history of this
bill

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if you don't mind I think um
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
we wanted to address another point
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
good morning uh thank you madam chair
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak Douglas solster
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
general counsel of the oplc uh director
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
Courtney doesn't like to say my last
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
name she finds it intimidating that's
 
00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:25.089 align:start position:0%
name she finds it intimidating that's
true

00:43:25.089 --> 00:43:25.099 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
I actually do too thank you uh
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we heard a lot
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
about on Wednesday we had a lot of
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from psychology we had a lot
 
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
of testimony from mental health after
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
the fact we had some conversations uh
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
with repetition with Dr Warner
 
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.730 align:start position:0%
with repetition with Dr Warner
um

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
and it caused me to go back and take a
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
second look at the language and I think
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
there are some valid points
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
um as they pertain to psychology and
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
mental health and yesterday I began
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I wasn't able to finish my
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
goal was to have some language to show
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
people today
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
um I'll finish it up as soon as I can
 
00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:04.700 align:start position:0%
and and distribute it as soon as I can
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
but we are actually taking a crack at
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
amending the language in this bill to
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
build in some of those extra protections
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
that I do think are there with good
 
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
reason for psychology and mental health
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
and and you know investigating further I
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
see some of the concern they have
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
and what specifically concerns would
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
they would be addressed in your
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh some of the concerns would
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
be around uh who gets eyes on the
 
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
records how they're approached but also
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
above and beyond that there's a certain
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
level I think at Psychology and mental
 
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
health where
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
um there's a vulnerability in
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
potentially the people affected by a
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
licensee and so
 
00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:51.859 align:start position:0%
what what we're also incorporating is a
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
requirement for oplc investigators to go
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
in and approach the board before we
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
address some of the individuals who may
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
not have been named or may have been
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
named but aren't aware not the actual
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
complainant themselves and sort of
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
building in those extra layers of
 
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
protection and getting the subject
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
matter experts to weigh in at an
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
additional level before investigations
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
proceed and so I'm taking the language I
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
did a I I reviewed the language that's
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
currently in law in both psychology and
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
mental health practice acts the language
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
except for citations is pretty much
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
verbatim it's word for word but I did a
 
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
line by line comparison to make sure
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
that before I proceeded with amending
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm incorporating a lot of
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
that language into the investigative
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
piece in 655 so that it will show up in
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
310. now I know Dr Warner this morning
 
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:48.260 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment to 329
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I haven't had a chance to review
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
that in detail but I'll look at what she
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
proposed and I'll and I'll see what I
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
can do with that as well
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
um of course collaboratively but I just
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to make the subcommittee aware
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
that based on testimony based on
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
conversations we are making some
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
I am sure that you are aware from the
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
hearing the other day also there were a
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
few representatives of different boards
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
real estate and so forth who said that
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
they were unaware that these changes
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
were being suggested my large concern is
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
that you have so many boards and
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
commissions under you that people that
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
were unaware of this that we haven't
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
heard from yet may have concerns that
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
aren't being brought forward also
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
so I can speak to that representative so
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
as you probably know this was a
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
confidential bill so we saw it obviously
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
um when it was released on the 20th we
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
do provide weekly updates regarding
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
um the calendar we also provided a list
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
of all of the lsrs asked the boards to
 
00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:11.579 align:start position:0%
go through and identify ones that they
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
were interested in having us track on
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
their behalf we had preliminarily
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
identified some bills but we need their
 
00:47:19.809 --> 00:47:19.819 align:start position:0%
guidance as well
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
and when this bill came out the next
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
board chair meeting that I have and I
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
have them on a monthly basis I verbally
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
told them about it
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
but again only five chairs go so you
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
know that's part of the issue but
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
um you know it's always a timing problem
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
with legislative process for boards
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
because it moves so quickly and they
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
only meet once a month so I do feel that
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
we notified them as soon as we were able
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
to notify them and
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
um you know to the extent that boards
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
are able to take a position where you
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
know we're working collaboratively with
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
them on that is what I would offer I
 
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
think that it's it's tough for the
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
boards to to participate because of the
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
nature of their work
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that and I also
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that this was not an impetus
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
of of you or your department
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
um and I know the bill came out quite
 
00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
late in the process even so thank you
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
Mr romancore is that you coming towards
 
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:49.190 align:start position:0%
Mr romancore is that you coming towards
good

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair my name is
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
Stephen reinkort I'm a licensed
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
electrician in the state of New
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also the executive director of
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
the electrical contractors Business
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
Association and we spoke on the bill the
 
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:01.220 align:start position:0%
other day and just had some concerns
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
just reiterating some of the things that
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
have been brought forward as we
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
understand that uh Lindsay has a very
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
tough job trying to manage both sides of
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
this and find a happy medium we think
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
she's doing her best and we try to
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
support the best we can but we do have
 
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
some concerns especially with the
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
Privacy part but
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
kind of what was just discussed most
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
recently is I think Communications is
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
all right and and again I know Lindsay's
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
been out of town blah blah but we talked
 
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.050 align:start position:0%
been out of town blah blah but we talked
about

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
she talked about getting this to the
 
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
boards our board met Tuesday and I
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
brought this to the attention of our
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
board it wasn't on the agenda it wasn't
 
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.150 align:start position:0%
board it wasn't on the agenda it wasn't
there

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
you know the boy didn't know anything
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
about it so
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
well she's got a lot going on we still
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
have to work on that because how does
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
the board not find out about it in a
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
meeting a day before at least if it was
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
confidential which I just found out I
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
didn't realize you know we saw it a
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
little earlier but
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
um so with a lot of these things
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
communication the board doesn't know
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
what's going on we're finding out about
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
these things afterwards we hear about
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation we try to track it we
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a lobbyist and trying to keep on
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
top of it is the amount of changes that
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
has happened to the oplc
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
is incredible I mean it's just over the
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
last couple of years
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
for instance we found out about our
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
licenses are going to be going to a
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
two-year renewal we're one of the few
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
that do three-year renewals and I
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
understand why it's going to it's a
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
biennium budget it's much easier to
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
figure out stuff of that but you know I
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't think there's been any
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
notification sent out yet or told or
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
even you know ahead of time because as
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
licensees we've been doing three year
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
renewals for many years now electricians
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
are a little bit habitual we get the
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
paperwork whether it's online or not we
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
fill it out we send it in we think it's
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
good for three years again
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
it has to be some better Communications
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
with all of it the participation of the
 
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.490 align:start position:0%
with all of it the participation of the
boards

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
I think as much as we want to find a
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
procedural process that's even
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
they're not this as Mr infantine spoke
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know they're not all the same it
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
should be handled the same and if they
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
did take these and they're trying to
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
find one procedural process then they
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
didn't repeal these and make them all
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
the same as you stated there's got to be
 
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
some policy changes because not everyone
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
was the same right we've heard that
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
already so there's no way that they took
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
what tried to make everything even and
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
kept it
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
what it was and I just think we should
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
look at that a little bit more
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
we had some concerns as far as the
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
Privacy like
 
00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:23.099 align:start position:0%
um the definition of allegations
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
complaints and investigations I think is
 
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.470 align:start position:0%
complaints and investigations I think is
important

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
um I had spoke about a situation I had
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure I make that
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
clear it was long before the oplc was
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
even organized so it wasn't anything
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
that happened during this Administration
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
or the oplc but you know that a
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
complaint to an allegation is to
 
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
investigation somebody calls and files a
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
complaint because they're just mad at me
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
or they haven't been they're not paying
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
their bill and they want me to go back
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
and finish and now I've got a complaint
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
against my and it's in the file
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
things like what happens if that
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
complaint is found to be I'm found not
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
guilty what happens to that paperwork
 
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
and that does it stay in the oplc it
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't if you weren't found
 
00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:05.930 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't if you weren't found
guilty

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
guilty
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
and it was somebody just you know having
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit of payback or something so
 
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
who has access to all of this
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
information if it goes through the
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
investigative Bureau um I believe Mike
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
was here yesterday and then maybe
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
there's only certain people who should
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
have access as I mentioned before
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
when we were aboard by itself we had one
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
or two administrative people so at best
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three people might have
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
access to this information
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know the total amount of
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
employees at oplc and I don't know the
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
exact structure of it but I would hope
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
that we would look at that and make sure
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
that we're confining that to as limited
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
amount of people as possible if there's
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
an investigation department that takes
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
care of the allegations and stuff then
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
every admin in the office does intend to
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
have access to all of this information
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know the they're struggling to get
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
employees employees are changing there's
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
constantly new people in there so it's
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
just a lot of information that is open
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
to people seeing and going through
 
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.790 align:start position:0%
to people seeing and going through
um

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
on page 12.
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think it is lying
 
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.270 align:start position:0%
I think it is lying
17.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
17.
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
um it talks about appeals in the appeals
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court one of the things
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we had as an electricians board is
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
we could appeal to the State Building
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
Code review Boyd we did that because
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
let's face it if I lose my decision from
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
the electricians board to take it to the
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is not going to be
 
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is not going to be
financially

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
feasible it gave us an opportunity as
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
blue collar workers to try to get some
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
sort of appeal and actually there was
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
one that went in front of the board that
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
went to the State Building court and was
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
overturned so I would hope that we could
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
look at maybe one other step before The
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court if there was appeals even
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
if it's a jury of legislators or
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
something like that I think that that's
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
it makes it very difficult well I
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
understand from a legality standpoint
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's usually how it works
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not fair isn't fair
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
because you can't afford it is really
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to
 
00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:02.930 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to
um

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
also the um there seems to be two
 
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:11.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
page five
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
it speaks about it on the uh
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
line nine roughly it the non-lapsing
 
00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
fund yes and seems to be two of them I
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
guess wanted some clarification on pay
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
on line 33 it talks about the ones
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
um for for the
 
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
there's one for professional licensure
 
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579 align:start position:0%
um it has to do with on the professional
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
side there's one for the health side yes
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
no I am 15 I'm sorry
 
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.970 align:start position:0%
no I am 15 I'm sorry
and

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
in paragraph three under that if you go
 
00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:47.099 align:start position:0%
further down on line 26 at the last line
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
he says the money's in his fund shall be
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
continuing to property to the office I
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
just wonder if we get some clarification
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
whereas the yellow ones show the funds
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
going to back to the um general fund on
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
the first dedicated fund
 
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
on line 13. so I was just wondering what
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
the difference was if they're not 125 or
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
they are if we're all going to be or not
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
and how that affects the overall budget
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
and fee structure so maybe we could I'm
 
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
sure miss Courtney could answer that
 
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.630 align:start position:0%
sure miss Courtney could answer that
question

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:23.510 align:start position:0%
um
also

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
there's

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
on page eight
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
line six
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
and this is just I'm just trying to give
 
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
you some examples of that this bill
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
needs a little bit of work we're not
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily against it we know it has to
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
be some procedure but it talks about
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
that if if you go back to page seven at
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
the bottom it talks about allegations
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
misconduct what they what um
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
they can do and it shows that on line
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
four says to carry out investigations
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
the executive director is authorized to
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
a retain qualified experts B conduct
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
inspections a place of Business and
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
Professional regulated under the office
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
all right I'm a small company I have a
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
home in home office I don't really think
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
the oplc should be able to come in and
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
investigate my home
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think there should be some guidelines
 
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
on that whether it's a commercial site
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
or something or whatever but I mean
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
there's a point again we were giving
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of legality to the oplc and
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
when we look at this
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
Lindsay's not always going to be the
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
director and everybody that in place
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
isn't always going to be there we've
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
been through this what changes with
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety we were under there
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to look broad not just
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
right here we're not we don't have any
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
issues she's been very good helping us
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
out working together but you got to look
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
at this as
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
are we covering everything so when
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
things change it's no thing there's no
 
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.829 align:start position:0%
things change it's no thing there's no
issue

00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
um trying to make sure that the boards
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
don't lose the control they have and I
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
and I I spoke about this to a few people
 
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.170 align:start position:0%
and I I spoke about this to a few people
yesterday

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
how do we find some warning that allows
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
them to other boards have control but to
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
a point where if they're not cooperating
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
that the executive director can move
 
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.650 align:start position:0%
that the executive director can move
forward

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to word that I'm not a
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer but I think that would be very
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
helpful because most of the boards
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
that's their concern they're losing
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
their Authority it's all going to the
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
OPC like representative bentine stated
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
they're just jurors
 
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
you know I mean the content and subject
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
matter of any experts we would like to
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
clear that up as well so that for boys
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
that have inspectors that it states that
 
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
those you are used first before hiring
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
and everything else because they're
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
licensed they know it's the laws are the
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
codes are it's very important that that
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
gets addressed as well
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
so there's you know there's a the three
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
sections or three different divisions
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
with some some
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
close warding would be much better but I
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
understand that makes it difficult for
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
the executive director as well
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
um balancing the political and
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
administrative part from Justice
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
standpoint as you said is is very
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
difficult but I hope the committee will
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
work towards that goal and I will end at
 
00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.309 align:start position:0%
work towards that goal and I will end at
that

00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you your testimony was respectful
 
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
my name is Laura Cooley I'm representing
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
myself I just want to support that last
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
idea he put forward that the executive
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
director can intervene when there is a
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
problem we have no root course against
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
boards that are not acting properly who
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
lie in public testimony there's no
 
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
recourse and people are hurt by this so
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
I would like to support this idea that
 
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
when a board is not Cooperative somebody
 
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:09.890 align:start position:0%
anyone else
yes

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Kimberly
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
Kirkland and I'm a lawyer in Manchester
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and for 15 years I was a
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
tenured faculty member at the law school
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
here in Concord and I just wanted to
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
address the issue you raised Madam chair
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
about the balance that's being attempted
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
to be struck with this litigation
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
um I I think what gets under the various
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
boards skin and the public skin is this
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
idea of procedure and having taught the
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
course in law school that's caused
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
called civil procedure for 15 years at
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
the Devils lawyers as well because
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
although procedure seems like it's just
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
rules about the steps we go through to
 
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
get something decided it's absolutely
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
integral to doing Justice you you can't
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
provide Justice for the licensed members
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
of all of these boards and for the
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
people making complaints unless there
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
are fair known consistently applied
 
01:00:19.319 --> 01:00:20.990 align:start position:0%
are fair known consistently applied
procedures

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
and those procedures do affect outcomes
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
if the procedures are all over the place
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
if they're inconsistently applied if
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
people don't understand what they are
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get just outcomes
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
from the system and so I think this bill
 
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
is really trying to ensure that the
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
procedures are clear accessible and
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
consistently applied and that will work
 
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:54.380 align:start position:0%
to the advantage of both the licensees
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
and to the people making complaints and
 
01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:00.859 align:start position:0%
it will also be beneficial to the oplc
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
which has to deal with 55 or 54
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
different sets of procedural rules which
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
is a nightmare
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important from that
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
respect I also say that although I
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
understand people are saying my my
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
specialty my substance area is different
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
and requires different procedures in the
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
legal system we've been able to create
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
procedures which decide disputes in a
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
vast array of subject areas so for
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
instance within civil law you have the
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
rules of civil procedure and their state
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
rules and federal rules but New
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for instance has rules of
 
01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:49.700 align:start position:0%
civil procedure that will govern the
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication of a contract dispute a
 
01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:57.020 align:start position:0%
construction claim a real estate
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
disputes medical malpractice claims any
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
kind of some subject matter you can
 
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:09.299 align:start position:0%
think of will be decided under the same
 
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299 align:start position:0%
set of procedural rules so they have to
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
be carefully thought out with all of
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
those different substance substantive
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
areas in mind but you can create a
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
single set of procedural rules that can
 
01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:25.940 align:start position:0%
cover a wide variety of different
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
substantive areas the other thing that I
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
see this bill doing that I think is
 
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
really important to the just resolution
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
of the disputes I'm I'm focusing on the
 
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
disciplinary function that these boards
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
serve is the division of the
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
investigative function the prosecutorial
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
function from the adjudicative function
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
I think you run into problems in terms
 
01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:54.980 align:start position:0%
of bias when the people who are
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
investigating and Prosecuting are also
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
adjudicating and when the people who are
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
investigating and Prosecuting are
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
members of the same Market
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
as the people who are being investigated
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
or prosecuted
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
um I think we all have a tendency to you
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
know want to give the benefit of the
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
doubt to the people within our community
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
and profession we all know New Hampshire
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
is an incredibly small state we know
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
each other well and I'll tell you that
 
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
the lawyers have struggled with this as
 
01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:34.460 align:start position:0%
well lawyers are not licensed by
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
any board from the executive branch
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
we're licensed by the New Hampshire
 
01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:42.380 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but in
 
01:03:46.569 --> 01:03:46.579 align:start position:0%
2004 the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
introduced a new system for lawyer
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
discipline because there were perceived
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
problems with having volunteer lawyers
 
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
who made up the professional conduct
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
committees which are the equivalent of
 
01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:02.839 align:start position:0%
the the boards we're talking about here
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
trying to investigate prosecute and
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
adjudicate claim claims against lawyers
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
and a decision was made to create an
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
attorney discipline office where there
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
would be a professional investigator and
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
prosecutor who would bring matters to
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
the professional conduct committee made
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
up of a mix of lawyers and lay people
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
for adjudication
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions but
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.819 --> 01:04:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
really

01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.530 align:start position:0%
really
okay

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:44.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes yes I just I was gonna
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
comment thank you because I think this
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
is helpful
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
in general yes so so when a complaint is
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
made obviously somebody comes in feeling
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
that they've been wronged but they're we
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't take their word for it and there
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
is some investigation that needs to
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
happen in the Civil system you would
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
have a lawyer representing both sides
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
and they would each be given an
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explore what information
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
do you have what information do I have
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
let's exchange that information so we
 
01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:38.780 align:start position:0%
both understand what the world of of
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
facts are that this has to be decided
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
from and that's what the investigator
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
would do here for these boards the
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
investigator from the oplc and it would
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
be that investigator's job to be getting
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
information from both sides and that's a
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
person without a dog in the fight which
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you to anyone else yes
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative schuette thank you I will
 
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
just ask
 
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:08.900 align:start position:0%
um you talked about the Civil process
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
having set rules but I would imagine
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
that there's a separate set of rules for
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
the criminal process and I think that's
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
part of the point that's being made here
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
as representative infantine pointed out
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
there's a vast difference between
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals construction
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
trades and medical trades so I I think
 
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's a worthy point because they each
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
have different parameters that they have
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
to meet you're absolutely right there's
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
a different set of rules of procedure
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
for criminal cases than civil cases
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's because criminal defendants have
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that are different
 
01:06:57.049 --> 01:06:57.059 align:start position:0%
than civil litigants however within the
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
Civil Justice System we would decide a
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
complaint between a homeowner and an
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
electrician and between a patient and a
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
doctor and those would both both be
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
decided under the rules of civil
 
01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:16.069 align:start position:0%
decided under the rules of civil
procedure

01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay can you come
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
could you come to this mic here and
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
speak that way
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.569 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:07:38.569 --> 01:07:38.579 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
I would just ask if Ms Kirkland would
 
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:44.780 align:start position:0%
outline her vision on who would do the
 
01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
investigation and prosecution I assume
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
the board would do the adjudication but
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
how would that be staffed how would that
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
what's the procedure do you know that
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
she doesn't work for oplc right so but
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
she's made a proposal that there would
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
be a split of those functions and I want
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
to explore that idea okay and apparently
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
Miss Courtney has something to say so
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
I'll let her thank you and you're I'm
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
Brad Holt thank you
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry I just thought I might
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
be in a better position to talk about
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
Staffing at the office so presently we
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
do have an enforcement division that has
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
three bureaus one is with compliance
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
that deals with inspections which is
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
more of proactive compliance ensuring
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
that people are proactively complying
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
with their requirements and then we have
 
01:08:36.289 --> 01:08:36.299 align:start position:0%
an investigative Bureau which has a
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
chief investigator he's a he's an
 
01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:39.490 align:start position:0%
chief investigator he's a he's an
attorney

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:39.500 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
and then we have our prosecutions Bureau
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
that has a chief prosecutor who's an
 
01:08:49.809 --> 01:08:49.819 align:start position:0%
attorney they he has three prosecutors
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
within that Bureau within the
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
investigations Bureau I think we now
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
have eight authorized investigator
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
positions we also have many contracts
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
with subject matter experts in the form
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
of Consultants which includes a
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
physician investigator actually two
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
physician investigators as well as
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
Dental consultants and nurse Consultants
 
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
we have other consultants and we are
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
continuously seeking additional
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
Consultants when we do not have the
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
expertise needed what happens is a board
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
member will recuse themselves to provide
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
that subject matter expertise I
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
envisioned that it would continue to
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
operate in the same manner except that
 
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
there would be a clearer division of the
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
investigative function from the
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicative function I don't anticipate
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we would require additional
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
investigators we do have a sufficient
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
investigators at this point but of
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
course another part of this bill would
 
01:09:59.209 --> 01:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
give us the ability to retain funds to
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
employ additional people as necessary
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
and two attorney hold's Point could you
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
come let's ask if I think you're going
 
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
to ask doc uh Kirkland for her
 
01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:17.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
interested in that okay
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Courtney
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
I did not have a vision different than
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
what Ms Courtney has just described I
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
think that's what the proposed Bill does
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
is it separates the investigatory and
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial functions from the
 
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory function
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
and with that two-way with the function
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I guess the composition of the
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
medical if you sub to me do away with
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
that yes I think it would I I defer to
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
Ms Courtney on that but I think it would
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
at least as an investigative and
 
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial unit
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
the personnel as well some late
 
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
Personnel but from different disciplines
 
01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:10.580 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:13.940 align:start position:0%
knowledge base would go away unless the
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
staff had that or used refused board
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
members that's part of the piece I don't
 
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
members that's part of the piece I don't
understand

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that Madam chair if you'd
 
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
like yeah so in the bill the bill
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
language and again this is not an oplc
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
requested bill but the bill language
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
does propose eliminating the MRC
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
presently how it works is well actually
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
there have been some recent changes with
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
respect to Medical complaints because
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
the medical review subcommittee has had
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
a significant issue in the last two
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
years making Quorum in 2021 for example
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
they only met about half of the time and
 
01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:54.980 align:start position:0%
it continues to be at a serious problem
 
01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
which has caused a significant backlog
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
of medical complaints the way it used to
 
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.750 align:start position:0%
of medical complaints the way it used to
work

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
prior to the recent changes in the last
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
several months is that literally every
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
complaint whether it was the physician
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
gave me Jello that I didn't like or I
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
was sexually assaulted had to go through
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
the mrsc and
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
that creates significant problems when
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
you have a body that's not being met
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
also you don't necessarily need
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
expertise for the complaints that are
 
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.370 align:start position:0%
expertise for the complaints that are
like

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
I got the wrong Jello and we do get
 
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
those so
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
um so previously everything was going
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
through the mrsc because that has
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
created a significant backlog we
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
recently worked with the Board of
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
Medicine to come up with a streamlined
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
process which does allow staff for
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
initial review of complaints and
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
malpractice filings to determine whether
 
01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
they've met that legal threshold of
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
stating a claim and this is pretty
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
consistent with the Civil process you
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
know it's pretty routine for defense
 
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
lawyers to file motion citizens saying
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
that the complaint doesn't allege a base
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
a legal basis for the claim so we do
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
have at the moment attorneys and
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
investigators who make that initial
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
assessment if they determine or they
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
believe that it doesn't State a claim
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
that is reviewed by our physician
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
investigator if the physician
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
investigator agrees with that assessment
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
it goes to the board if the board
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
disagrees with that assessment then it
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
goes for formal investigation to the
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
mrsc and if the board agrees with that
 
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
assessment it gets dismissed now I can
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
tell you what happens at the emergency
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
is that the complaints sit because
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
they're not being investigated the MRC
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
has explained to us that on average each
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
person can only review one to two cases
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
Max per month and that's when they meet
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
and they meet on average about half the
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
time so if we get four you know about
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
400 complaints a year which includes
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
malpractice filings that is why we are
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
not getting through these cases so
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know that this is the
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate model and we're not
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
advocating for
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
you know one way or the other but what I
 
01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that the current model
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to Medical complaints is
 
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
not working
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
um the bill as proposed would change
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
that again we're not taking a position
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
on whether that's uh whether that's the
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
best approach and I know representative
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
Pearson has a separate bill on that we'd
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
be happy to you know work with him to on
 
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
different procedures but I will say that
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
this bill does propose a change and in
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
my opinion any change is good at this
 
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
point because we're just at a standstill
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you we will we'll take that into
 
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.270 align:start position:0%
thank you we will we'll take that into
consideration

01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:15:52.140 --> 01:16:05.290 align:start position:0%
anyone else
yes

01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:05.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
my name is Kelly ledke I am a Master
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
Level alcohol and drug counselor I
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
testified on Wednesday on behalf of
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
myself but I had a board meeting
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
yesterday so I just want to update that
 
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with my board members and
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
they have voted to give me permission to
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the Alcohol and Other
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
Drug use professionals board so that's
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
one update
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I'll keep this very brief because I
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
did submit written testimony I went line
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
by line for each piece that we disagree
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
with and some things that we feel
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
neutral on I think I just want
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
to again say
 
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
when I left on Wednesday the word
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
streamline was buzzing in my head all
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
day right that this was about
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
streamlining making the process easier
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
but I think I'm still struggling
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
I guess the buzzword in my head is
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration there has to be
 
01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
streamlining of course but there has to
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
be collaboration and I'm not feeling the
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
collaboration in this piece so what I
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
mean by that is I do think just as
 
01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
people have testified today that the
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
oplc has done a wonderful job coming in
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
and making some great changes for us I
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
still think there's a lot of room to do
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
I just want you to make make a comment
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
about that sure this is not being driven
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
by oplc I understand okay so they they
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
didn't make any of the changes these are
 
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
changes that were done by
 
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
Representatives who are on this bill
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
right okay good
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
but the there are going to be changes in
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
the way that we do things with oplc
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
so this isn't this isn't a bash on
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
anybody this is just saying if we repeal
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
some of these laws it isn't going to
 
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
give us the opportunity to do the work
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we need to do and some of them
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
don't feel streamlined right taking away
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
our ability to have an advisory
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
committee is not streamlining anything
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
taking away our ability to be able to
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
investigate cases doesn't feel
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
streamlined it feels like a reduction in
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
our Authority as a board
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make that point again
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
that I think everybody can work together
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
this feels very extreme like this this
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
bill feels like it's over here we might
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
have been over here and I want to find
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
us here working together boards with
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
oplc to make things better for the
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
public in terms of Public Safety thank
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thank you for that
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:50.209 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else who want to speak
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I do appreciate it
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
uh with the small packet that I gave you
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh the second page second piece of paper
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
had Amendment language for concerning
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
cost of Investigation
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
there's a section uh in section one RSA
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
310 colon 12 sanctions to delete section
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
Roman 5.
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
and then also to add a section perhaps
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
section 192 or reorder repeals cost of
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
Investigations RSA 332 G colon 11 is
 
01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
Investigations RSA 332 G colon 11 is
repealed

01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
um you heard on Wednesday from Dr
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
Phillips about the cost of
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
Investigations being passed along after
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
somebody might be found they had a found
 
01:19:58.850 --> 01:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
in complaint and they're at that point
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
we're getting sanctions and uh just to
 
01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
point out why these are not needed and
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
they're overdone is that
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
G11 was passed about in 2016 and I did
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
look up and there were no boards and no
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
providers and no professional
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
associations involved in the development
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
of that legislation
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
um but number one it's unheard of to
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
collect these costs from the convicted
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
even in criminal court cases the state
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
and the local law enforcement does not
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
recover the cost of the investigation
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
from a convicted Criminal
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
number two the burden of proof for the
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
license hearing
 
01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
is much lower than that even of Criminal
 
01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.570 align:start position:0%
is much lower than that even of Criminal
Court

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
in the license hearing it's clear and
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence and in the criminal
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
court it's beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is a much higher standard and yet
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
the licensee would receive a much higher
 
01:21:01.739 --> 01:21:02.810 align:start position:0%
the licensee would receive a much higher
penalty

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
and now that is an unlimited one in G11
 
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:09.500 align:start position:0%
it was capped at ten thousand dollars
 
01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
and then in this there's no cap on it at
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
all number three the cost of the
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
investigations are already paid by the
 
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
licensees as the office is calculated
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
license fees to be 125 percent of the
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
department operating expenses they're
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
already been paid distributed across all
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
licenses making these redundant Monies
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
and unjustified as punitive in nature
 
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
and therefore an unwarranted violation
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution's Eighth Amendment
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
against cruel and unusual punishment
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wants to speak
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
on this house bill
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
nope okay I'm closing the public hearing
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
I mean the subcommittee meeting
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to have another one
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
so stay tuned it won't be next week I
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
can tell you that okay
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime we will take all
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
these considerations and discuss it
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
among ourselves
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
I have four five pages of notes here and
 
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.169 align:start position:0%
I have four five pages of notes here and
um

01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
we'll have an amendment that's why it's
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
going to take a little bit of time so
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
we'll have an amendment and see how far
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
we get how's that
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time and
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for caring about the
 
01:22:34.679 --> 01:22:35.330 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for caring about the
bill

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.580 align:start position:0%
