everyone okay I'm going to open this
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
executive session and uh the first bill
 
00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
to be considered is house uh excuse me
 
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
458 and uh representative merchant do
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
motion yes I do Mr chair I make a motion
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
to interim study and my Ral for making
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
the motion inter study in let's get a
 
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
second thank reprentative Le on seconds
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead so my rationale for inm study
 
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
was in talking with the pharmacy board
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
and also talking with the director of op
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
PLC the clinic chose um a different
 
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
route um they went down through phys
 
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
dispensing to expand it and that was
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
what the declaratory ruling was all
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
about if they had gone to the board
 
00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
asking for a pharmacy permit initially
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
they would have been granted one so at
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
this point in time based upon the
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
president of the board based upon the op
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
PLC director saying the board has the
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
authority currently to issue a permit so
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
they could dispense that route there's
 
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
no need for the bill however I also have
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
concern that I don't want the board
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
dragging its feet along with oplc with
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
rulemaking because I want this to go
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
forward as quickly and exped
 
00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as we possibly can so
 
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
therefore my recommendation to the
 
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
committee is interim
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
study okay representative Lan did you
 
00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
want to speak to you a second um yes
 
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I appreciate
 
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
all the work that's gone into this and I
 
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 align:start position:0%
believe that an interim study would will
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
allow us to follow up and see make sure
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that a they understand how important it
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
is in order to get these rules set and
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
then also to follow up and make sure
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
that they're far enough along in the
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
process that we don't need to suggest
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
actual legislation to um follow up and
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
and and ensure this happens I would be
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that they'll already have
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
rules written and they already have
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
what's necessary in place uh by the time
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
we need to write the report for interim
 
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
study and um I believe that this is a
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
good solution to get to where we need to
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
be so I support this motion okay thank
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative McKay seconds

representative Weber would you like to
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.029 align:start position:0%
speak to your
motion

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:51.110 align:start position:0%
motion
just

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
as we've all been grappling about what
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
to do with these
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
synthetic uh derivatives of
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
hemp and um I appreciate that
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative Leon made a valiant
 
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
effort to try and put a
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
sensible way of addressing it into the
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
statute and I do recognize that they
 
00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
problems with the way things are now
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
because they come into the state
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
unregulated or they come into the state
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
from other places where they are not
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
regulated but um the the bill as it came
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
to us will repeal the repeal of the
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
prohibition which gets us back to
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
keeping these prohibited and that at
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
least if we find that there are problems
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
gives um law enforcement some authority
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
to to deal with them and I think that
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
for the moment with everything in the
 
00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
state of flux that's the way we should
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
keep things uh so I'm hoping that you
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
will support an not to pass
 
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
motion okay thank you other discussion
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
representative McKay did you want to
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
comment on your second or no
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
representative of PL uh thank you uh
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for your
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
explanation because a repeal of a repeal
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
confused me now I understand what it
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
does representative
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair uh I will be
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
voting against each time uh we announce
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
a drug V on a certain drug it's being
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
replaced by more dangerous drug and
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
second uh like one of the reason for
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
is uh maybe people are dying from those
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
drugs but there was no proof during the
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that anyone was killed by by
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
those synthetic cannabinoids in New
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so uh I I don't see an urgency
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't support the drug war so I
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
will vote against thank you thank you
 
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
chairman um I had this amendment that I
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
had right now was just to try and
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
clarify some language and it wasn't
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
right that's why I didn't introduce it
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
but I had also sought to have an
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to push the sunsight out
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
another three years because we've been
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
waiting in the state to actually do
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
something about cannabis legalization
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
and this should continue to have the
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
option to be a carrot in order to
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
encourage the other body to finally
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
agree with us on some sensible
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
legalization and sensible policy um so I
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
I maybe we may end up coming with that
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
um time period um where we would just be
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
extending the sunset further out so that
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
we can keep the conversation going but
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that to the floor I just I'm
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
not going to support the a to pass
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
because um I'm not quite convinced that
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
the other body is uh working in the same
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
spirit that we came to this agreement
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative mlan and then
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel yeah I mean and and
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
on that line because I I'd spoken with
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative lean about that I mean I
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
was really moved by uh the testimony by
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
Mr Simon about you know the impact of
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
these cannaboids um and so I don't like
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
them but you know I'm hearing a lot of
 
00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:10.839 align:start position:0%
stuff in the news with respect to how
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate is maybe positioning itself
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
with respect to our legislation and so
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about well we're going to
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
make cannabis legal and all this stuff
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
but it's kind of almost putting the cart
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
before the horse so I was kind of in
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
support of keeping the prohibition in
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
place but basically having a a
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
three-year window to just kind of let
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
everything kind of settle out with that
 
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it it it came to me at the
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
last minute we didn't have time to make
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
it happen so could I maybe just get a a
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
straw poll Mr chair if we were to bring
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
forth a floor Amendment you know if we
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
ought to pass it today and we bring
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
forth a floor Amendment for the the
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
threee sunset would that be something
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
that that folks would maybe support
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass it today and they a floor
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment for three years I just a straw
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
pull throwing it out
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
there representative
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
wber uh just a comment on that I think
 
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.110 align:start position:0%
wber uh just a comment on that I think
if

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't object to a three-year
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
Sunset but I think that if anybody here
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
thinks that the Senate is going to be
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
influenced in their views towards
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
legalization and I I share the
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
frustration of my colleague who has has
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on this um I don't
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
think whether we have a sunset in 3
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
years or whether we simply extend the
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
prohibition is going to have a blind bit
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
of difference over there because think
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
of all the incredibly strong incredibly
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
valuable work that has been done to meet
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
their needs and their
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
expectations and it has been unavailing
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
and I think that if all of those best
 
00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.629 align:start position:0%
and I think that if all of those best
eff

00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
eff
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
on a hugely bipartisan basis in the
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
house uh with all of the input that
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
people have considered over months and
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
years and
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
decades um I don't think what we do on
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to have any
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
difference so um I'm I'm very
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable letting it go as a as a
 
00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.350 align:start position:0%
comfortable letting it go as a as a
straight

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
straight
 
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.030 align:start position:0%
straight
prohibition

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see why we would
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
spend the effort to do the three-year
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
but representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
chair I I just wanted to make two
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
comments first um um number one I'm
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to support the bill as is secondly
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
well the third three comments second one
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
is um you know we deal with a lot of
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions to drugs death is only
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
one of them there's plenty of others
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
that we need to worry about and the
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
third is kind of a prophecy that I
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
shared with my colleague earlier today
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
um I have this very entertaining poster
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
at home that was made in the 1950s that
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
shows a doctor between surgical cases
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
saying that he prefers Camel cigarettes
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
to everything else and the the reason
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
why I bring that up is I don't want to
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
sit here in 50 years and say that we
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
created the same mess with cannabis
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
which I personally believe we're on the
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
road to doing so I think the more we can
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
control these dangerous substances of
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
more highly addictive nature that will
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
have an adverse effect on our young
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
people the better and I think that's why
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
would there's a lot of thought needs to
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
go in this as we go forward so we don't
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
create another Public Health
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
crisis thank you all right um why don't
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
we do that STW poll um representative
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
profile uh thank you Mr chair so I I
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
guess I'm conflicted over this bill
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
because I on one hand I would like to
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
see us maximize freedom on the other
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
hand and I saw materials that showed
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
substances that were made to look like
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
packaging for candy and that really
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
bothers me furthermore uh a gentleman
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
came in here who
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
is his you know his mission is to
 
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:18.519 align:start position:0%
advance cannibalization
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
legalization and he said we are against
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
these things being legal so I am um I
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'm conflicted on this one but I tend to
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
want want to come down on what I see as
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
the safe side of this having said that I
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
would and and and I for me this the the
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
context of other legal
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
legalization conversations does not
 
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
impact my vote on this bill
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
um having having said all that I I'm I'm
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
inclined to support this and I would be
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
much more inclined to support it if it
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
had that
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
Amendment with a with a three-year
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
window okay representative palaz
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
a question to if we are doing a SL po
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
could somebody better explain what
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
amendment we are voting uh
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
getting thank you Mr chair no I was just
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
trying to to gauge the the temperature
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee representative poov as
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
to whether or not if we pass this ought
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
to pass and I was to bring a floor
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
amendment when we go into session for a
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
three-year Sunset if that's something
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
you know that the the that the folks on
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
the committee thought would have value
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
and would support when it came to the
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
floor could you explain what s s said
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
would mean inste of immediate right it
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
would be yeah so what happens is if we
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
don't if we don't pass this if we pass
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
this bill then the prohibition remains
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass the bill then I think
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
in July or whatever it is I forget the
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
time if we don't pass the bill then all
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
of a sudden this stuff comes back back
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
on the streets I don't want the stuff to
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
come back on the street um but
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
everything the whole discussion is in
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
flux so I just wanted to have a
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
three-year window to say guess what
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep the prohibition um
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
but instead of it being a forever
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
prohibition it would just be a
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
three-year prohibition and we could
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
evaluate things and come back uh either
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
with a repeal or a permanent prohibition
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
at that time um it just basically
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
instead of having a permanent
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
prohibition it just gives us a
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
three-year um that's all I was thinking
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
or years so I'm not sure what the
 
00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:04.789 align:start position:0%
or years so I'm not sure what the
prohibition

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
does do I need to repeat that for the
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
record yeah go ahead I said I'm not sure
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
what a three Re prohibition does because
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
you can't bind a future legislature so
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
future legislature could lift a
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
Prohibition or keep it or whatever
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's true of any law
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
right representative Weber I think we're
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
having this discussion because the
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
reason for this bill is there there was
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
a sunset
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
prior and that
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
Sunset of the prohibition is going to be
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
up in July of this year and we're all a
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
little uncomfortable about what happens
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
then or many of us are uncomfortable
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
about what happens then um so um but I
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
think that my feeling about a three-year
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
Sunset as a floor amendment is um I
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't vote for it but if it passes I
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
would vote for the bill as amended but I
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh I probably wouldn't do a lot of work
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
I I think I think there are a lot of
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
things that I would
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
like to be out there before this stuff
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
this stuff seems to me to be the Wild
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Wild West and I I really appreciate the
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
efforts to Define and regulate and and
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
keep things below a certain safe level
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
but there are so many things that we
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
could regulate better control better
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
this isn't one of them so I'm I'm really
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
very comfortable with the permanent
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
prohibition and if we learn different if
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
we come up with different language as
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
you say that can happen any one of the
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
next years representative not up
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
them I guess I'm in favor of three years
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
is better than nothing and in the three
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
years when things are legalized on both
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
sides of that you know whatever we've
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
got a little time to wiggle and in the
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
meantime we're keeping strange stuff
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
dressed up like candy off the counters
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
which I'm in favor of but if I may sure
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
but if we pass a Prohibition we pass a
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
Prohibition and we keep it off the
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
counters until that bill happens and
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
then that bill can legalize whatever
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
they want to legalize in a comprehensive
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
way so that's why I'm arguing for not
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
having to redo this every three years
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Nel did you have your
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
hand up no
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I'm seeing no other
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
discussion representative mlan I I I
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
just think for for some people who are
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
like pure free market folks having a a
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
three-year Sunset out there it might be
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
something where they would say you know
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
I I'll go for that because I know at
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
least it's not forever so it's something
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of bring people together um
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
because I saw a lot with this thing if I
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
have a choice between octopath and
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
itl I'm octop pass um absolutely but you
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
know but there may be other folks that
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
there may be not and so this may be some
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
Middle Ground just thinking ahead and so
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
that's what that was why I asked for the
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
straw pole thank you Mr chair he do you
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
still want your straw pole
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
or yeah be okay okay I'll those in favor
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment looks like at least half the
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
committee right one
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
two okay all right go ahead if you want
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
to offer that then so yeah I mean I'm
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
opposed about 5050 right
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so okay thank you Mr chair I think
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll there's enough interest that
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll I'll work something up and
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
the floor will dispose of it as it will
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
all right uh any other discussion on um
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
sp5 representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think that I'm going to
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
end up opposing this all to pass just
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
because I think that on the floor that
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be a better motion but um I
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
recognize we're all going to do what we
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
want to but I just wanted to let you
 
00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.390 align:start position:0%
want to but I just wanted to let you
know

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
why anything anyone else any other
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
discussion all right that being said the
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
motion is out to pass on S sp505 I'll
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%

it all right so we'll just go with uh
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the majority report then who Mr
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
chair representative Merchant who made
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
the motion to pass representative Weber
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
sp505 okay say none okay with that I am
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
well no we will'll keep the executive
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
session open to consider these other
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
bills rep uh Miss D do you have that
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
side by side for
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
the bottom two have already been before
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
the other three are just coming out of
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
committee oh okay so you can consider
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
the Amendments areed
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
IDE so there's a potential effect
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
more 1 all I did was um the amendment
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
because it's very short um it just adds
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
you paperwork goes along with this that
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
I need to asked Karen if she didn't know
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
um well this is all I got we could get
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
copies for everyone but the side by side
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
we'll address it yeah and again we can
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
all have copies if if we need
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
there's a roll call or anything like
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
that I believe so no I think it's
 
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
year I was saying we don't normally take
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
roll calls we just sort do it
 
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.310 align:start position:0%
roll calls we just sort do it
informally

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
informally
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
usually it's it's the end of the road
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
unless you really want to study it
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
unless you really have people studying
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
it now which I think is by exception so
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
you that again a report has to be
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
written by October 25th and it can be as
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
simple as uh not recommended for future
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I understand or it can be as
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
so okay well we can we can put it
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
together then I like I can just
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
appointment you going to put like a sign
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
or um that would be a a good way to
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
approach it um
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
Christina we have a could we get a list
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
of all the interm study bills yes I do
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
okay I know I've already started one so
 
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.430 align:start position:0%
okay I know I've already started one so
it

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
may we're getting information on other
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
potential bills that are coming back to
 
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
potential bills that are coming back to
us

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
um these have not been acted on as yet
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
right Christina right the only there's
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
and we need another copy of the
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
1712 oh so this is a third bill that we
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
had had before yeah well the these
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
are the two bills we're going to talk
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
about today are 1303 and 160 9 these
 
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
others are potential ones that are going
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
to be coming back that we'll be ready to
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
have some background on if and when that
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
occurs we just try and look ahead of a
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
little bit and then 1712 that's one of
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
the that bill is is also um it looks
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
like an amendment that's been offered
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
over there um in the Senate and I they
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
on which one ones are weed uh 13 uh 1303
 
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.509 align:start position:0%
on which one ones are weed uh 13 uh 1303
and

00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
16009 Christina they have enacted on
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
1712 right this this amendment's just in
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
like in the pipeline and they haven't
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
actually passed this yet or no so they
 
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.870 align:start position:0%
actually passed this yet or no so they
it

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.909 align:start position:0%
 
has

00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right great thank
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
you okay so uh looking at the two bills
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
that we have formally gotten back and
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
the first one's actually a second
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
committee bill so uh representative
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
Janan with the ways and means will and
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
his group will be weighing in on it
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
after us but with the first committee uh
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
that was the one uh dealing with the
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
estate of teste B
 
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:49.519 align:start position:0%
Banu and um I'm uh the other body does
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
what the other body does I thought we
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
offered a good proposal a third a third
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
and a
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
third and they made it 40% 4 % and
 
00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
20% so um I'll throw it up to open the
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
conversation I I don't have a problem
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
with what they did I don't know why they
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
did it but representative
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
Weber I have to say that um from from my
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
perspective alone I would just concur I
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
think the idea of going to a committee
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
of conference and then having the
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
possibility of somebody being cranky
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
with something completely
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
different uh doesn't make sense I think
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
all of this is a windfall and that we
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
ought to Concur and get it on its way
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
and get the money to the people who can
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
use it I I would agree with that um
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
Murphy just a question that that I
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
didn't know the answer to Is does the
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
state or the people that run the estate
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
have an opinion about this or that would
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
be my question if they don't they ask
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative Weber oh on on the yeah
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
never mind I'm sorry no if if as long as
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
the state does not have a problem with
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the the change I would agree with
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that we should just concur they
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
didn't really weigh in on how they
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
wanted us to handle it um and the
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
department is fine with it but they were
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
just concerned about where it was going
 
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
to go how it was going to be handled and
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with the you know the
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
individual's wishes representative
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman I don't
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
see any reason to um non-c concur accept
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
annoyance and and I don't think we
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
should I don't think we should let that
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
be our primary motivation so I think we
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
should just concur is there any
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
objection to concurring on this
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill all right I'll I'll let the ways
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
and means folks know and that we want to
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
Concur and I suspect they all agree with
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
that okay next up is uh HB 1609 FN and
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
we have a side by side on that I I
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
believe it's pretty
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that please sure
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy I presented this
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
to we passed this bill uh initially back
 
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.149 align:start position:0%
to we passed this bill uh initially back
um

00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
whenever and the amendment that I worked
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
with um representative krishman on uh
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to include direct Primary Care
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
provider the one that we picked was the
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
New England direct Primary Care
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
Alliance subsequent to our passage of
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
the bill we realized that that group
 
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
does not look favorably upon nursing
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
care for and include nurses as part of
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
their Primary Care um uh initiative so
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
we found direct Primary Care Frontier
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
which is a New England New Hampshire
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
based that actually has nurse
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
practitioners and it basically allows
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
for nurses to participate in the primary
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
care so what we did is between the time
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
when we passed it unanimously to when I
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
presented this to the committee uh HHS
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
at in the
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
body uh we gave him this amendment to
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
basically change the name of the um
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
direct primary care that we would
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
utilize going forward and they were
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that they voted 5 zero I
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
think it
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
was you have any thoughts about about
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
what action we should take I I would
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
definitely concur because it was it's
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with what we all uh agreed to
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
going forward representative kushman and
 
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
myself both agreed that having direct
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Frontier as a New Hampshire
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
based uh Direct Care um that also
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
recognized nursing and nurse
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners specifically in the care
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
of their patients was important to us so
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
we both agreed to that as well okay
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you y
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
this is a question for the
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative um doctor they so when
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
you say nursing I just want to make sure
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
I understand nurse and nurse
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner or just nurse
 
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
practitioner thanks for the question uh
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
they the New England direct primary cure
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
Alliance within the Cadre of you know
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
providers does not include nurse
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners that's okay that's what
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
whereas the direct Primary Care Frontier
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
which is in New base does include nurse
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners as part of their Primary
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
Care model um and representative kushman
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
felt very sensitive to the fact that
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
they were uh that the New England direct
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Alliance was specifically
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
excluding nursing Personnel in their
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
Primary Care uh practice can I ask one
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
more question go ahead in in the in
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
interest of being bruised and battered
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
over some other issue um does this also
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
include Physicians Assistance or
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
not uh is that irrelevant I think that's
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
irrelevant I think that they are
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
included but because they work under the
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
license of a physician they can be part
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
of their Primary Care team um so this
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
was a amendment that we had asked for
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
and it was introduced to the Senate but
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
subsequent to our passage unanimously in
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
this body um as it was originally
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
written representative per and then
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative TZ thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious I don't have any
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
problem with this change but I'm just
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
curious is the are the other members of
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
this commission um identified as
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
individuals or as part of a specific
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
practice or representative of a certain
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
group of practitioners I'm just
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
wondering why this is so
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
specific as opposed to a representative
 
00:36:56.359 --> 00:36:57.870 align:start position:0%
specific as opposed to a representative
of

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
um direct primary care right I I I agree
 
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
um the majority of the people and I
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
counted them out I think there's about
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
21 that are on this commission uh and
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
this is the commission that was
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
established back in 200 and 10 I believe
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
it was uh on the commission of the
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary Primary Care
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce I'm on their committee as a
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative of the body of the the
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
house but there is also um and I'll read
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
to you the medical society appointed by
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
Society uh Dental Society appointed by
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
the society so the great majority are
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
appointed but there are you know
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that what was specifically
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
noted was that we wanted to pursue a
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative from the primary care the
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care those the 24-hour
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know you know shops you see on the
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
side of the road you know direct primary
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
care you don't have to have a primary
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
care for provider you
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
basically um go in there get your
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
primary care issue addressed and go home
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
but you don't have a specific tie to
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
these people um and so we wanted to have
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
a direct primary care
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
provider uh as one of the
 
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
21 um Representatives you know on this
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
commission uh the only and we passed
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
that initially like I said
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
unanimously um it was subsequent to that
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
and this was not initiated by this the
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
other body this was initiated by myself
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
and representative kushman that we would
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
we recognize that New England direct
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Alliance does not have
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners but that the direct
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Frontier which is at New
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based um uh organization does
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
have within
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
their um primary care providers nurse
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
practitioners and we thought that was
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
important Paul
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
so I I would just say that um my vote if
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're taking a vote would be to concur
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
although I think it's a little
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
problematic to have a specific practice
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
what if the practice goes out of
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
business but um but I guess that could
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
be addressed when they go out of
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
business if they go out of business and
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
that'll also say something about direct
 
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
Primary Care perhaps so um I think we
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
should just concur I I think it's um
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
close enough and better than what we
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
what the way it left this committee
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative TZ yeah just uh as a
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
response to the questions the first
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
thing is there is no direct Primary Care
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
Association in the State uh there's the
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
two practices I spoke yesterday to the
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission because we were
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
in a meeting together um and so she
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
expressed you know she explained to me
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
what representative Murphy already
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
explained about the why and the other
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
thing is just to clarify direct Primary
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
Care is when um there's no insurance
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's direct between a patient paying a
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
provider directly some people might
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
think of it as concierge um it's a new
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
model of practicing and my objection
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
originally was similar to yours where it
 
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
should be an association and not a
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
particular business but I think we've
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
gotten to the best place we can and I'll
 
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
also Concur and if I could just address
 
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh direct Primary Care is
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
a new C model and so it would be very
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to just basically say the
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
direct primary care of whatever state or
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
whatever County or whatever you know
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
group of states you live within you know
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
New England say so it was important to
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
at least have the direct primary care
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
that was part of New Hampshire the only
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
one that's part of New Hampshire be
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative on the board or on this
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
commission so he chose them but you're
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely right that once it becomes a
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
body that is more formally established
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
um perhaps then you could just say um as
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
with the other ones you know appointed
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
by the Association appointed by the
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
governor appointed by the
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
society but I would I would definitely
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
concur because we actually
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative krishman and myself were
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that asked them to introduce
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment representative
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
M you Mr chairman if I'm correct the
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
Senate just changed one thing in this in
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
our bill and that was the go from New
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
England direct primary to direct primary
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
care and I I don't think it's our job to
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
reconsider this whole
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislation we're we're saying do we
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
agree with the Senate I agree and I
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
think we should get on with
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you any other
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
discussion uh so is the sense of the
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee to concur then on
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
16009 okay
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
great all right those are the only two
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
we have actually gotten back again
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
there's five pending my thought is and
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
I've confirmed this with the clerk and
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
and with the representative Weber if we
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
when we get others back if so me they
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't kill them all uh I know they're
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
killing a lot of house bills over there
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
but um we can you know representative
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
Weber and I can confer and then confer
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
with our respective caucuses and come up
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
to it with a decision that way rather
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
than in the interests of time and
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
people's schedules rather than have
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
yes by caucus right by caucus right
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
there won't be a formal meeting but
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
Weber as this is our is this is our last
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
meeting for the session I just wanted to
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for your
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
leadership and for the way in which you
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
have run this committee um I I think
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
that an example has been set of how to
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
disagree very
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
vigorously but to still maintain a
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
certain degree of decorum and
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
collegiality and I very much appreciate
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
it and I want to thank all of my
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
colleagues for uh making that possible
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you all thank you
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber representative Leon
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and I kind of
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
feel bad bringing up a technical matter
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
after such a wonderful statement to the
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
committee and I do want to thank my
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues um everybody here for the
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
same and having such a great committee
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
1568 um they've amended it to what um so
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
far coming out of committee they have
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
the language of Senate Bill 409 as it
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate however we in this
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
committee amended Senate Bill 409
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
because there were the conflicting
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
language about the response of a of a
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
911 call and whatnot um so I think that
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
we perhaps may want to also consider
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
that in combination with Senate Bill 409
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
as it passed out of our committee
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
because that is also a house position um
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to bring everybody's
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
that um on the bill that that um we had
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
here for the for the potential
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
concurrent should they pass it is House
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 1568 the relative to Medicaid
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for non-transport
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
emergency medical service calls um they
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
had changed the language to Senate Bill
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
409 as they sent to us but they did not
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
include the amendment that this
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
committee passed um in that language and
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe um it at least in the
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
work sessions Finance did not further
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
change that bill um so assuming that
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
nothing unexpected happened yesterday in
 
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
finance they passed it with the same
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
language that this committee had so I
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
don't so the question would be if how we
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
proceed should that other language
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
pass they not making a formal
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation just raising a concern I
 
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
yes I'm just raising a concern and that
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
we should also draw that Paraline with
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
parallel with Senate Bill 409 personally
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
if they if we pass 409 um especially if
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
they accept it I think it's the superior
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
language because we changed it from what
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
to nor has uh Senate Bill 409 passed the
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
Full House finally but we should know
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
that those two are parallel
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
bills I think Christina Dyer has some
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
information on this
 
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.510 align:start position:0%
information on this
not

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
right yes I agree with you on that part
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.309 align:start position:0%
that
legisl

00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
legisl
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
de yeah Christina will be updating us as
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
they do pass the U the full Senate and
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
so that we can we can take them up and
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
act yeah okay um
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
anything else on these bills Mr chair
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative PL I just want to say
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
work well and I wanted to say I'm
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%

right well again following up on
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I appreciate um you
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with her and and
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
learn from eight terms is it you've been
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
I think I was reading about it eight
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
learn from her experience um is no
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
substitute for experience and she
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
certainly uh former um speaker Pro
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee chairman how many other titles
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
have you
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
had but anyway I do appreciate her
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
guidance and her her advice throughout
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
this these two years and certainly
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate the vice chairman she had to
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
fill in probably more than she should
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
have had to fill in because of some
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
medical issues I had last year but thank
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
you representative Lon for that and
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank all of you I think we we've done a
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
lot of good stuff I think we've uh the
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
number of bills for a committee that
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
deals with some of the controversial
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
stuff we deal with to have as many on
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
consent as we have had I think is
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
commendable and really shows an effort
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we want to work together and we did
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
work together so again thank you all um
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be seeing each other on the floor
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the house um I think most of are
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
probably running again but one never
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
knows what the voters are going to
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
decide so whether we see each other next
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
year or not but but we will be seeing
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
each other in the next several weeks so
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
again thank you all anything else before
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
we conclude representative Nagel
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
the uh representative uh Christina you g
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
to send a list out
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
right no representative
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
Weber if we have meetings on them uh
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
they have to be done in person because
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
we don't do anything on Zoom um and what
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
comes out of those meetings is either
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation or
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
not recommended for further legislation
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
and an explanation we just write a
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
report that goes in the house calendar
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
and we will all get together uh one more
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
time to vote on those uh so that will be
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
a regular sort of committee meeting but
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
all we can vote on is recommended for
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
further legislation or not we don't have
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
to have the legislation drafted and it
