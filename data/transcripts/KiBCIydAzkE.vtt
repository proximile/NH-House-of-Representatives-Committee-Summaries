we're hoping for a 15-minute
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
presentation with 15 minutes of
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
discussion and then we'll go to the
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
second project
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
after that so i'll turn it over to the
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
to uh emily parity and to jeremy
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
thank you look forward to it go ahead
 
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:25.830 align:start position:0%
thank you look forward to it go ahead
and

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do the presentation and
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
then we'll hopefully be able to ask you
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
okay so good morning everyone thank you
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
to chairman pearl
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the environment on agriculture
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
um for hearing our testimony today my
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
name is parity capadea and i
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
along with my group members emily liu
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
and jeremy rodriguez
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
have compiled a presentation to showcase
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
our research
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
on the topic of pesticides and
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
neonicotinoids on behalf of the policy
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
research shop at rockefeller center
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll pass the baton to
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
jeremy who will begin with a brief
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
overview of pesticides
 
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
hi everyone uh so just to clarify this
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
particular section will only cover
 
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.830 align:start position:0%
particular section will only cover
pesticides

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
pesticides
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
um and to introduce them we conducted a
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
literature view of the
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
effect of pesticides on human health so
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
in a review we found a considerable body
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
of research explaining the detrimental
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
effects of pesticides to the human body
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
um pesticides can cause immediate health
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
effects on on contacts such as rashes
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
blisters blindness nausea
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
and even death in some cases they can
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
also cause long-term health effects
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
some of the literature we reviewed found
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
connections between alzheimer's disease
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
and organophosphates and growing
 
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.870 align:start position:0%
and organophosphates and growing
chlorines

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
chlorines
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
asthma and herbicides birth defects like
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
spinal bifida
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
and nitrates brain cancers and
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
insecticides and herbicides
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
and a number of other diseases linked to
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
pesticide exposure in our analysis we
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
also noted the higher rates of health
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
issues among farmers and agricultural
 
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.509 align:start position:0%
issues among farmers and agricultural
workers

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
an estimated 44 of farmers are poisoned
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh by pesticides every year
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
according to recent studies um and some
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
of this burden is due to close proximity
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
to pesticide application and phenomenons
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
like pesticide drift
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
which is essentially chemicals that do
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
not reach the target crop
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
um that is then carried away by wind and
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
with some application technologies only
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
10 of the pesticide actually reaches the
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
target crop
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
and that pesticide drift can reach as
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
far as 50 miles from the original site
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
this occupational risk of farmers also
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
affects their families
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
one study found increased concentrations
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
of pesticide metabolite in the urine of
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
children and farmers
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
exposure can occur either by direct
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
pesticide drift or from farmers carrying
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
pesticides on their clothing and
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
protective equipment is mandated by the
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
worker protection standard but we found
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
many studies studying that farmers still
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
experience significant exposure
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
even when wearing wps recommended
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
building practices
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
lastly migrant and seasonal farmers are
 
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
lastly migrant and seasonal farmers are
arguably

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
arguably
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
um the high uh at the highest
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerability because of their social
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
economic and linguistic
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
marginalization that our exams have been
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
occupational hazards poverty and poor
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
living conditions
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're also more likely to be paid less
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
and experience more occupational
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
injuries and illness related to
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
pesticide exposure
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
now pass it on to emily who will delve
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
thanks jeremy to shift gears a little
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
bit now we're going to be focusing
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
specifically on
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
neonicotinoids or neonics for short
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
which are a widely used neurotoxic
 
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
which are a widely used neurotoxic
insecticide

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
insecticide
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
and so like nicotine it binds to nerve
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
cells and
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
insects this over stimulates them and
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately kills them
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of usage neonics are applied in
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
over 120 different countries
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
and have 140 different crop uses
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
including rice and cotton
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
and some non-agricultural applications
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
include golf courses lawns and gardens
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
and here's a map of omidicloprid usage
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the u.s which is one type of neonic
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
and as you can see it is
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
widely used throughout the country and
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
unix are particularly effective against
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
sap beating insects such as aphids and
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire neonics are frequently
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
used in apple orchards
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
so neonics are water soluble which means
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
that they dissolve when in contact with
 
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
that they dissolve when in contact with
water

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so they can be applied to the soil or
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
sprayed but they're primarily used
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
as a seed treatment which means that all
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
parts of the plant will take up the
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
neonic as the plant grows
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the munich is present in the pollen
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
and nectar
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
and treating seeds reduces the need for
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple pesticide sprays
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
which makes coated seeds a widely used
 
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.949 align:start position:0%
which makes coated seeds a widely used
option

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
for example in 2015 between 79 and 100
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
of corn seed was actually already
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
pre-coated with neonics
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
and here's a table that sums up some
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
agricultural manufacturers that include
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
neonic compounds in their products and
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
let's talk briefly about pesticide
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
regulation in the states
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
the division of pesticide control within
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
agriculture markets and foods oversees
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
pesticide licensing in the state
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
and so licensing involves exams and
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
applications and the division issues
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
licenses to both
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
commercial and private applicators as
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
well as pesticide dealers
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
while the core materials of required
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
exams focus
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
on pesticide safety and environmental
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
concerns broadly
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
neonics have become a topic covered
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
during recertification education
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
and so for an individual to maintain a
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
pesticide license in the state
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
every five years they must attend
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
educational seminars
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
and stay up stay updated on pesticide
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that currently includes
 
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.190 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that currently includes
neonics

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%

applicators
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
have also consistently covered bee
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
health and neonic use
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
finally the division is able to enforce
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
these regulations and licensing
 
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:09.910 align:start position:0%
these regulations and licensing
protocols

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
through random field checks and
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
implement various punishments for
 
00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
implement various punishments for

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
while neonics are widely used within the
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
last decade
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
new studies have raised some concerns
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
that there may be some downfalls
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
as unix may have a negative impact on
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
non-target organisms
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
specifically bees also known as
 
00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:31.509 align:start position:0%
specifically bees also known as
pollinators

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
pollinators
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
there's currently some conflicting
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
research as to the exact effects of
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
neonics on the health of these
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
and this is because experiments have
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
been a little inconsistent in their
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
methodology and then their outcomes as
 
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
methodology and then their outcomes as
well

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
so however the majority of laboratory
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
and semiconductors
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that neonics are associated
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
with increased mortality
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
impaired feeding and reduced colony
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
growth in bees
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
and in one lab setting showed that a
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
connection between
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
low doses of imidacloprid which is one
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
type of munich
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
and colony collapse disorder or ccd
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
which is a phenomenon in which
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
bees abandon their hives during the
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
winter and die
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
however it should be noted that cct has
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
actually been declining since 2008
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
and can be caused by a number of
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
different factors including
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
parasites habitat loss and environmental
 
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
parasites habitat loss and environmental
changes

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
so pinning ccd exposure alone would not
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
capture that full picture
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
that being said a recent report
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
published by honeybee researchers at
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
cornell does
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
highlight the risks of munich exposure
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
to honeybees
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
so using some hazard data including
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
toxicity and then exposure data as
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
metrics for risk
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
a wide scale meta-analysis revealed that
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
neonic treated seeds
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
specifically cause high risk to bees and
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
according to that report
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
in and near corn and soybean fields
 
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.910 align:start position:0%
in and near corn and soybean fields
receiving

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
pre pre-treated and unique seeds
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
74 of exposures are likely to impact
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
honeybee behavior a 58 percent
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
are sorry physiology 58 of exposures
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
impact honeybee behavior
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
and 37 percent of exposures will impact
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
honeybee reproduction
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
in addition unix may also impact humans
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
in some harmful ways
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
and human exposure to neonics can come
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
through contaminated food
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
or drinking water or even occupational
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
uses and within one systematic review
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
chronic exposure studies reported some
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
adverse health effects such as
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
congenital heart disease and memory loss
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
however exposure
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
must be really significant for neonics
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
to cause acute toxological effects
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
and this is because neonics have been
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
selected to be specific
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
for uh acetylcholine receptors in
 
00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:44.629 align:start position:0%
for uh acetylcholine receptors in
insects

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
insects
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
and they therefore show low affinity for
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
bitter vertebrate and human receptors
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
and are less toxic
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
humans than older insecticides are and
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
unix also typically do not pass
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
the blood brain barrier which prevents
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
toxins from getting to the space where
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
neurons are
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
in human brains and this also reduces
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
the potential for
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
mammalian toxicity and that concludes
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
the section on neonic risk i'll go ahead
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
and pass it off to
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
my colleague purity to discuss some of
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you emily so in addition to
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
evaluating the potential risk to
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
pollinators we also evaluated potential
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
benefits of neonicotinoids
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
and namely we relied on the same study
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
that emily mentioned
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
by honeybee researchers in cornell who
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
examined the potential risk and benefit
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
of neonic use or non-use in new york
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
and so they conducted economic analysis
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
on crops in new york
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
and they conducted or they examined over
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
5 000 paired trials
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
on different crops in new york to
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
examine the effects
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
on on crops and so they conducted
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
research on a number of different farms
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
and found that
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the trials conducted on
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
showed that neonic use does in fact
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
reduce pest populations
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
limit crop damage or improve yield
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
untreated control plots and so there is
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
benefit to farmers for using
 
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
benefit to farmers for using
neonicotinoids

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
neonicotinoids
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
there's direct economic benefit that was
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
found by this group of researchers
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
the one caveat that the researchers did
 
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.390 align:start position:0%
the one caveat that the researchers did
find

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
is that the potential benefits of
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
neonicotinoids are
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
more limited for certain crops compared
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
to others
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
so in 83 to 97 of the field trials they
 
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
so in 83 to 97 of the field trials they
examined

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
examined
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
there was no significant increase or
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in corn yields
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
when neonicotinoid treated seeds were
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
used compared to pyrethroid chemical
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
alternatives or other untreated control
 
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.470 align:start position:0%
alternatives or other untreated control
seeds

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
seeds
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
so this translates to more infrequent
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
economic benefits for corn farmers who
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
use neonics
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
um yet as my colleague emily mentioned a
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
significant portion of conventional
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
field core farmers do use
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
neonic treated seeds the study also
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
found similar results for soybean crops
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
and they found that 82 to 89 of field
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
trials found no increase or decrease
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
in soybean yields compared to the
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
chemical alternatives
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
and the epa also released a study 2014
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
now revealed that seed treatments
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
provided negligible overall benefits
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
to soybean production some more research
 
00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
to soybean production some more research
is

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
needed on this topic especially in
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
relation to crops that are specific to
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
the the study also could not account for
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
differences between pest pressure and
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
yield response associated with certain
 
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
yield response associated with certain
crops

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
crops
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
which did vary between the farms and the
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
data did not also
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
account for the insurance value of using
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
neonics in a preventative manner
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
so more research is needed on this data
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
to assess the potential economic
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
benefits to farmers in new york
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
um specifically for assorted vegetables
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
apples hay and sweet corn which are
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
major crops in new hampshire so now pass
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
it on to
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
jeremy who briefly give an overview of
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
different states regulations
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um so in our report we also
 
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um so in our report we also
connected

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
connected
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
um across state analysis with states
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
that have existing neonic regulation
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
vermont passed hb 205 in 2018 which made
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
neonics a restricted use pesticide
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
meaning that only state certified
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
applicators can use neonics
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
the bill was influenced by the
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
significant increase if you have colony
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
loss in 2017
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the bills essentially banned
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
consumer use and uh increased
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the annual registration fee for
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
pesticides to offset inspection costs of
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
pesticides and develop educational
 
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
pesticides and develop educational
services

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
it also requires uh beekeepers to
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
register with the agency
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
of agriculture food and markets and
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
submit a pest mitigation plan
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
in 2014 minnesota passed hf2798 which
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
focused on informing consumers about
 
00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
focused on informing consumers about
plants

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
plants
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
treated with neonics through labels
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
however a large portion of neonic use in
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
minnesota it goes unregulated through
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh treated seeds which evade federal
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
regulation under the fifa
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
and like vermont uh maryland passed
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislation restricting the use of
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
neonics in 2018
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
to only certified applicators and
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
finally new york has the most recent
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
which was introduced in 2021 the birds
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
and bees protection act proposes
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
elimination of neonics where risks two
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
partners outweigh
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
economic benefits the bill also proposes
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
bans on neonic
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
treated seeds for corn soybean and wheat
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
crops and other nuanced
 
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
crops and other nuanced
bands

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
lastly we also conducted somewhat of a
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
case study examining the potential
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
effects of neonic regulation on planet
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
or health in connecticut
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
was the first state to restrict the use
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
of neonics in 2016
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh banning used by consumers through sb
 
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.870 align:start position:0%
uh banning used by consumers through sb
231

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
231
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
neonics under the bill are not allowed
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
to be applied to plants that have
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
bloomed unless they're in a greenhouse
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's inaccessible to pollinators uh
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
the bill also sets up an infrastructure
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
pollinator health like the uh pollinator
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
um they also mandate um they also
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
mandated the model
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh model pollinator habitat education
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
and interventions
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
um in deforested areas um help
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
facilitate that those habitats um
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
connecticut experienced a large
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of b
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh colony loss at the beginning of 2015
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
through 2018
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
but that trend significantly decreased
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of 2018.
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
we were wondering how sp 231 impacted uh
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
colonies specifically in terms of
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
pesticide related deaths so we use the
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
national agricultural
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
statistics service to compile averages
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
on the table on this slide
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
given that sv-231 passed in 2016
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
one might expect a steady decline in
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
pesticide related losses of colonies
 
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.669 align:start position:0%
pesticide related losses of colonies
however

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
as you can see that trend decreased and
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
then increased again
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and this essentially elucidates the need
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
for controlled experiments and the
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
underscores the complexity of the
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
situation as the economies can be
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
influenced by a variety of factors from
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
climate change to predators
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
disease weather and so on um
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
and to conclude um excited please
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
to conclude our research has shown that
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
the answer to neonic
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
regulation isn't simple and linear there
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
are numerous stakeholders who may be
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
impacted by regulation
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
or non-regulation and the complexity of
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
this neonic usage and its effects
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh make it even more difficult there's a
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
need for nuanced legislation
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
that is science-based and addresses the
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
concerns of the stakeholders involved
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
there are certainly economic benefits
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
from the use of neonics however
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes the benefits are negligible
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
for crops such as
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
corn and soybeans in the case of new
 
00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:35.909 align:start position:0%
corn and soybeans in the case of new
york

00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
york
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
and all in all whatever the community
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
decides on it's clear that the
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
regulation needs to be nuanced
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think we're now open to questions or
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you so a lot of
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
information in there to uh
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
try and digest quickly i'm glad you
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
sent the slides to the whole committee
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
so i guess we'll open it up to the uh
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee and see if anyone has
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
too many questions for jeremy emily or
 
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:10.950 align:start position:0%
too many questions for jeremy emily or
caridi

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
caridi
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative aaron go ahead okay can
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
you hear me
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
everybody can hear me yes okay good
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for this um
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful presentation it was very
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
informative and
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
um interesting i do have a couple of
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
questions and one
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
my first question is i i would direct to
 
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
my first question is i i would direct to
emily

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
emily
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh so in describing the study
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
uh and the effects of neonics
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if the study was based
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
on approved and proper use of
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
pesticide versus
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
the non-professional or uncontrolled use
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's more you know backyard farmer
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
or smaller farmer or you know
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that question and
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
from my understanding
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
of this report they were all controlled
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
field studies so they were done in the
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
state of
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
new york under new york regulations and
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
so it was
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
less of the like backyard kind of
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
non-agricultural applications and more
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
of controlled field crop studies on
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
soybeans and corn if that answers your
 
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.430 align:start position:0%
soybeans and corn if that answers your
question

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i have
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
another follower yes i have a question
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
for jeremy as well
 
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:46.820 align:start position:0%
uh when you were discussing um
 
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
uh when you were discussing um
[Music]

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know the pesticides usage
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
i was wondering you know in other states
 
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
i was wondering you know in other states
that

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
have restricted the use of these
 
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
have restricted the use of these
pesticides

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
pesticides
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
were they then using alternative
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
pesticides that perhaps
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
were worse because uh
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
you know there are several tools in our
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
toolbox for how to control
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
pests that attack different crops
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering you know if we if we
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
ban or restrict usage would that
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
then make people rely on
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
pesticides that are worse to the
 
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
pesticides that are worse to the
environment

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
worse for our bees and worse for
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh the you know crops involved
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
um so we didn't collect data on
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
alternative uses for um in the states
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
that at least have uh
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
switched to um i've switched to new
 
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.390 align:start position:0%
switched to um i've switched to new
restrictions

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of the states a lot of those
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
things i mentioned still utilizing unix
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're just
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
more restricted to only certified
 
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.430 align:start position:0%
more restricted to only certified
applicators

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
applicators
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
um so i'm not sure about um
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
the use of other alternatives but i know
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
that those states still use neonics just
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
in many cases they're just restricted
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that answers your question
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much uh
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative mola has a question hi
 
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:16.710 align:start position:0%
representative mola has a question hi
chair

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much for letting me
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak chair and thank you uh
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
for this great presentation i actually
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
learned a lot um
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
i one of the things that i like how it
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
focused on was the honeybee population
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
because i
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh i think that that's a real big issue
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't get a lot of attention
 
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.710 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't get a lot of attention
sometimes

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
or at least get a lot of wide discussion
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'll say that from people who aren't in
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
the scientific community
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i was kind of
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
curious about i would really like to see
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
first a comment then a question is i
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
would really like to see
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you all dig a little deeper into
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
vermont maryland and those states that
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
have restricted it
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
and maybe get a little deeper about how
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
they restricted it
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
and what what alternatives people have
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
been using since then
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
and uh what are maybe some outcomes
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
because that's always the
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's always the benefit of trying to
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
enter into any kind of new policy
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
is to understand what it looks like on
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
the back end if there's some information
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
for there so if you guys have any
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
information to that that you
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
that you know you'd work on next that
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
would be very interesting to hear
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that i have is that
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
um i understand that you were saying
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
more study needs to be done in
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
connecticut to understand why their
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
pest numbers sort of decreased and
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
increased and buried do you all have any
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotal thoughts on that or
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
or things that you might have come
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
across that say aren't necessarily
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
what you would put in a study but
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
something you would discuss because i'm
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
just curious about that
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um so um
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
i i guess from a like a i guess personal
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
experience doing the research and
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
maybe emily and pretty can also add to
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
it seems like that like the that
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh neonics are pretty um like the
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
effects are just not very well
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
understood especially in regards to
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
um like different types of plants like
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
in some cases they're a lot more
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
economically beneficial than others um
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
and some they're not at all and they
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
end up being more harmful um but
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
it the numbers seem to fluctuate because
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
also there's a lot of other
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
um factors that um are
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
kind of confining variables uh so
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's like weather disease
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
human interference uh climate change
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh predators like parasites were a huge
 
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.590 align:start position:0%
uh predators like parasites were a huge
um

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh parasites were a huge threat to
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
bee colonies so i think it really it's
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
hard to like get concrete data and even
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the data that is collected
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
um often like has confounding variables
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so i feel
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
that like there needs to be really
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
controlled experiments to actually fully
 
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.710 align:start position:0%
controlled experiments to actually fully
understand

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh the effect of neonics on pollinator
 
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.310 align:start position:0%
uh the effect of neonics on pollinator
health

00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
moving forward i think sorry i don't
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
know if that answered your question
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
it it did chair may i have a follow-up
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
sure one more go ahead
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh i just quickly you know i think that
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
you're right i think there's a lot of
 
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
you're right i think there's a lot of
variables

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
variables
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
variables to that and it would be really
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
interesting to sort of approach this
 
00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:14.870 align:start position:0%
interesting to sort of approach this
discussion

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the future also i'd be interested
 
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.149 align:start position:0%
uh in the future also i'd be interested
knowing

00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
for instance what plants are really
 
00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
for instance what plants are really
affected

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
by this and what what aren't
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
economically what which plants show
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
benefit what plants don't because that
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
actually might be
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
very useful in tailoring any kind of
 
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.909 align:start position:0%
very useful in tailoring any kind of
restrictions

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
um for certain types of plants or
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
certain types of plant use
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
i again i'm just i'm not speaking from a
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
from perspective that you know that i i
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
know much about restricting uh this at
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
this point but
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that any specific
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
information that you guys can provide in
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
the future i think would be very very
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
interesting and very very
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
helpful uh going forward when you're
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
making any kind of policy decisions as
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
we try to grapple with that
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah definitely and that's
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
what new york did with the birds and
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
beats pollinator act and
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
birds and music protection act and they
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
used cornell to
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
follow up on that study and see which
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
crops were effective and which weren't
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
and i think a similar study would would
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
be really useful for new hampshire
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
just to learn about the specific context
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and which
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
plants um are the most beneficial with
 
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.029 align:start position:0%
plants um are the most beneficial with
neonics

00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
neonics
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question thank you
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we'll take one more from
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative bixby and then in the
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
interest of time we'll have to move on
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
to the next section
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative dixie okay so
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
one thing that um you didn't i don't i
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
don't think you mentioned in the
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
presentation but was in
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh your uh uh was in the written report
 
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.190 align:start position:0%
uh your uh uh was in the written report
was

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
that uh it there were there's something
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
there was something about
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
um about uh
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
neonicotinoids ending up in the
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh being measurable in the fruits and
 
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.269 align:start position:0%
uh being measurable in the fruits and
vegetables

00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
vegetables
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
that uh the they had been used on
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
so um you know if you were for instance
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
if it was a squash then
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
um there would be uh traces of the
 
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.549 align:start position:0%
um there would be uh traces of the
neonics

00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
neonics
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
in the squash um
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
after the pesticide had been used and i
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
was wondering if
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
you could give a little bit more
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
information on that and also
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
some information on whether there are
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions about whether
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
you can use neonics um you know
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
sure i can speak a little bit to that
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
so it is a little the current mechanism
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism behind a translocation of
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
pesticides in plants
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
is pretty unknown or poorly known but
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
the i think what you were mentioning in
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
the report was that we cited that one
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
study in 2005 found that
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
some plants or some vegetables
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
specifically such as
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
leafy vegetables and tomatoes and
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
cucumbers have higher amounts of neonic
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
residues than others
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately with this study there
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
was no indication of what the
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
application method of the munich was
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
so that is something that certainly
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
needs additional research
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
but in terms of how neonics are
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
taken up by plants um we do know that
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
neonic compounds
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
are often kind of dispersed throughout
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
the environment instead of being
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
the environment instead of being
actually

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
taken up by the plant uh one study found
 
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.190 align:start position:0%
taken up by the plant uh one study found
that

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
only about five percent of the active
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
ingredients of neonics are actually
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
taken up by the plants and
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of that other residue
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
and also chemical compound kind of um
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
is within the soil and then can also
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
lead to pesticide drift
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
so those are certainly concerns but
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
again the impacts of that on humans
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
is a little unknown because while
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
humans well while eunuchs do have lower
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
mammalian toxicity
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
and kind of the extent of exposure and
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
the resulting harm from that there's not
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
a ton of
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
literature currently
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
thank you i also sorry i wanted to
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
briefly mention i think this got skipped
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
over in the presentation
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
um but when we were speaking to
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
pollinator health experts they expressed
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
an interest in clarifying
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
some of the language around what emily
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
was talking about so i think some of the
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
language around
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
b toxic pesticides and whether they're
 
00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:29.509 align:start position:0%
b toxic pesticides and whether they're
systemic

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
systemic
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
is kind of at dispute between different
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
fields and so systemic could refer to
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
something that is long lasting in the
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
environment or something that is taken
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
up fully by the plant
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i think the confusion of that term
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps in previous legislation about
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
the bill or just general legislation
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
um has kind of confused the policy
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
regarding that so i think maybe
 
00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
regarding that so i think maybe
clarification

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
as well as additional research would
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right uh
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
dr shaco i guess we'll move on to the
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
yep we've got uh kelly and frandi i'll
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
talk a bit about
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
sustainable waste management in new
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i'll turn it over to
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
can everybody see that the presentation
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
hi i'm frandi and i'm here with my
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
teammate khalid and we just want to
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you guys for giving us a chance to
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
present our investigation on solid waste
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
management in new hampshire
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
um it means a lot to us that you took
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
the time out of your day to
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
listen to us um so
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
sorry to start off sideways management
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has fallen far behind
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
out of neighboring states and the nation
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
as a whole within the past decades
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
and this primarily can be attributed to
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
the budget cods budget cuts that the
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
solid waste management bureau has
 
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.790 align:start position:0%
solid waste management bureau has
experienced

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
over a decade ago the this bureau had a
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
planning and community assistance
 
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
planning and community assistance
section

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
whose duty was to oversee each
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
municipality to ensure that they were
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
receiving adequate assistance on solid
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
waste management
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
yet today the section finds itself with
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
only one active position
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
the lack of resources for each
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
municipality has also left them without
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
a standardized procedure with regards to
 
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.430 align:start position:0%
a standardized procedure with regards to
managing

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
managing
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
managing municipal solid waste and has
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
contributed to the state's landfill
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
capacity rapidly dwindling
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is all exacerbated by the fact that
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
the last solid waste management plan of
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
the state was published in 2003
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
leaving municipalities to decide what
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
the best practices are
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
for themselves which proves to be a
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
difficult endeavor
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
it's also worth noting here that rsa
 
00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
it's also worth noting here that rsa
149m

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
149m
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
states that the bureau has to update
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
their solid waste management plan every
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
six years
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
however that is not reflected in the
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
and here we can see that there are
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
currently only six
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
operating landfills in new hampshire
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
with three being public
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
and three of them being private and it's
 
00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:04.310 align:start position:0%
and three of them being private and it's
worth

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
noting here that fifty percent of the
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste um disposed in these private
 
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
solid waste um disposed in these private
landfills

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
comes comes from out of state
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
particularly massachusetts which
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
has now an extensive plan to reduce the
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
amount of solid waste
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
in their own um state by 50 by 90
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
by the year 2050 which just worsens the
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
current problem here in massachusetts
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
i mean sorry and here in new hampshire
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
um four of these landfills are expected
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
to close
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
to have their earliest anticipated
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
closure date within the next decade
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
as depicted by the graph um evidently
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire needs to do something now
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
if it wants to address the rapid
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
decrease in the state's plan for
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we ultimately decided
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to investigate what
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
techniques new hampshire could
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
potentially utilize
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
as alternatives to landfills and to
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the volume of solid waste
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
produced overall
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
also for each of the alternatives we
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
found we kept in consideration how
 
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.030 align:start position:0%
found we kept in consideration how
economically

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
economically
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
and environmentally sustainable they
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to talk a little bit more
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
about landfill gas energy
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
this is the first alternative disposal
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
method um to landfills that we
 
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.390 align:start position:0%
method um to landfills that we
investigated

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh and though this alternative does not
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
directly reduce the volume of solid
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
waste in landfills
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
landfill gas energy facilities can make
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
existing landfills more environmentally
 
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.630 align:start position:0%
existing landfills more environmentally
sustainable

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
by repurposing the landfill gas released
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
by solder waste
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
for context landfill gas is composed of
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
approximately 50
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
methane and 50 percent carbon dioxide
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
which are detrimental
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
to the environment what landfill gas
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
energy facilities do is that they
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
capture this gas through a series of
 
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
capture this gas through a series of
wells

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
wells
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
and focus on drawing out the methane
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
since it could be repurposed into energy
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
this gas is then compressed and chilled
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
to draw any liquids through condensation
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
and is converted into energy through
 
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.030 align:start position:0%
and is converted into energy through
either

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
electricity generation direct use of the
 
00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.069 align:start position:0%
electricity generation direct use of the
medium

00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
medium
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
or turn it into renewable natural gas
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
the resulting energy can then be sold by
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
to nearby clients or be used in the
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
facility itself
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
to lower its own emissions and reliance
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
on other fuels as well as costs
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh one main benefit of these facilities
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
is that they reduce greenhouse
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions uh municipal
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
solid waste landfills are the third
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
largest human generated source of
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
methane emission in the u.s
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so reducing these emissions from
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
landfill helps mitigate global climate
 
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.670 align:start position:0%
landfill helps mitigate global climate
change

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
another benefit is that they repurpose
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
landfill gas in sustainable ways that
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
can bring about health
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
and safety benefits to local communities
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
they also reduce the odors or that are
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
emitted by landfills and
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
lessen any explosion hazards that can
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
result from the gas accumulation
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
in these landfills and lastly the
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
generated energy from these facilities
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
can also be sold
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
to nearby clients creating new revenue
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
streams for these municipalities
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh building these units also creates a
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
bunch of new jobs
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
related to the facility design
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
construction and operation
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
for our investigation specifically we
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
honed in on a landfill gas energy
 
00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:02.950 align:start position:0%
honed in on a landfill gas energy
facility

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
already operating in the state at
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
turnkey recycling and environmental
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
enterprise facility
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
and another operating essential landfill
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
in johnson rhode island
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
and to the right we can see a little bit
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
more information on central landfill
 
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
like how it generates
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
33.4 megawatts annually
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
reduces carbon emissions by 1.27 million
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
and saves 2.1 trillion btu per year
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
we discovered that while many landfills
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire have the appropriate
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
equipment to have
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
landfill gas energy facilities many of
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
them do not participate in the endeavor
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
particularly beneficial to the at the
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
aforementioned facilities
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh both of these facilities tend to show
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
how effective life for gaza energy is
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
with representatives from these
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
facilities saying that the project paid
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
itself back within a decade
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's also worth noting here that another
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
revenue stream in new hampshire
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
for the energy generated in these
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
facilities is through renewable energy
 
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
facilities is through renewable energy
credits

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
credits
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
that the state offers there are
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
currently two landfill gas energy
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
candidates in new hampshire one is in
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
lebanon and the other one is in
 
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.309 align:start position:0%
lebanon and the other one is in
bethlehem

00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
bethlehem
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
some considerations that the state must
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
deliberate on before implementing
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
alternatives is
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
one which technology will best fit for a
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
facility which will depend on the
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
landfill gas that's generated there
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
two it must compare the costs and
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
benefits and determine what what is the
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
most cost effective method
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
and whether they can pre it will
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
eventually pay itself out as it usually
 
00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:26.630 align:start position:0%
eventually pay itself out as it usually
does

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
and three it must determine the overall
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
economic and environmental impact on new
 
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
economic and environmental impact on new
hampshire

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to turn it over to my
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
teammate kelly who's going to talk a
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more about wasted energy in
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um so another way of dealing
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
with um all the solid waste produced
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is through
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
waste to energy technology mass burn
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
incineration is the most commonly used
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
waste energy technology
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
um with 75 operating plants in the us
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
currently um in these plants trash is
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
sorted to move any hazardous materials
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
or recyclables
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
on and then there is a large scale
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
combustion the heat generated from this
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
is used to convert water into steam
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
turning a turbine
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
on generator which produces energy
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
the ash generated from this is then
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
filtered for any other material that can
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
be burned again
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
and set and what's left over is sent to
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
the landfill which is much smaller
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
in mass than the original solid waste so
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the volume of solid waste going
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
into the landfills
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
these plants actually remove greenhouse
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
gas emissions by one ton of carbon
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
dioxide equivalents
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
for every ton of waste diverted from the
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
landfill instead of the methane
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
being released um
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
into the atmosphere from landfills
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is being converted to carbon
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
dioxide as it's burned um and some of
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
the new carbon capture
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
technologies make this a actually fairly
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
clean way to deal with solid waste on
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
they also have high economic benefits
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
with studies projecting that
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
a dollar 77 is injected into the economy
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
for every dollar of revenue generated
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
by the waste to energy um
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
sector we looked at the wheeler greater
 
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.790 align:start position:0%
sector we looked at the wheeler greater
concord

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
facility for waste to energy which is
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
the picture on the right as well as a
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
solid waste management
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facility in palm beach
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
county florida
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
um the clinton concord process is 191
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
600 or 191 600 tons of waste per year
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
on and the energy from that powers over
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
14 000 homes and saves about 195
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
000 barrels of oil every year um
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
so despite the fact that there is one
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
waste energy plant in new hampshire
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
building another one isn't the most
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
viable option for how to
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
reduce solid waste in new hampshire just
 
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.030 align:start position:0%
reduce solid waste in new hampshire just
because

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
the nature of the size of or
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the amount of solid waste you need to
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
make this
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
worth it um new hampshire is a pretty
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
spread out state that works in concord
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
which is one of the more densely
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
populated areas
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
um so that's a limitation and
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
right now on new hampshire's hierarchy
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
of solid waste management
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
incineration is low um so they would
 
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
incineration is low um so they would
also

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
need to move that up and make it a more
 
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.349 align:start position:0%
need to move that up and make it a more
favorable

00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
favorable
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
way of managing waste in new hampshire
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
and then the other way if we're not
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
creating new facilities we can
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
reduce the waste that is being
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
created right now 35 percent of
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's waste is recycled or
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
composted when it could be
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
up to 80 percent um so one solution is
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
passing more comprehensive
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
recycling legislation we looked at
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
examples in other states vermont
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
is one of them that has a pretty
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive universal recycling law
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
which bans blue bin recyclables leaves
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
and yard debris and food waste
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
all from going into the trash in vermont
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
it establishes a pay as you throw policy
 
00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:27.750 align:start position:0%
it establishes a pay as you throw policy
um

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
some of the parts like the food scrap
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
ban were phased in to give time for the
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to build up
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it did come at a significant cost it
 
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
cost the state of vermont about five
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
a year to have this policy um
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
but even if new hampshire is not ready
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
to implement
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
a full comprehensive law like this there
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
are many parts
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
of the universal recycling law that
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
adopted into new hampshire to reduce um
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
waste another piece of this of recycling
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
is glass recycling and bottle builds
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
right now most recycling in new
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire is single stream which means
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
the glass is too contaminated to be sold
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
back to the last companies
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
so with a passing a bottle bill which
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
they have in connecticut
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
maine massachusetts in vermont the glass
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
collected could be cleaner and able to
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
be sold back
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
and another thing new hampshire is doing
 
00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
and another thing new hampshire is doing
um

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
with glasses working with the nra
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
it has a program where they crush
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
recycled glass
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
down um and incorporate it into roads
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
um and so expanding that program could
 
00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:40.710 align:start position:0%
um and so expanding that program could
help

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
divert some waste from landfills and
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
then finally
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of waste in new hampshire comes
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
from out of state
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
in 2018 49 of the solid waste that was
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
filling up
 
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's landfills came from out
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so by reducing or disincentivizing
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
states from
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
bringing their waste to new hampshire we
 
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.349 align:start position:0%
bringing their waste to new hampshire we
could

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of waste going into
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
landfills um
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
one state we looked at as an example was
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
ohio they have
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
a surcharge for waste
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
that comes in from out of state that's
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
higher than the in-state cost
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
so the landfills in new hampshire are
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
filling up four of them have plans to
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
close in the next decade but
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
the rate of solid waste being produced
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
is not slowing down
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
so something needs to be done about this
 
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.790 align:start position:0%
so something needs to be done about this
issue

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
um and we came up with some
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations first is to update the
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
management plan as friendly touched upon
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
this hasn't been
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
revised since 2003 a lot has changed
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
since 2003 so this needs
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
some updating um more funding could be
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
provided to the solid waste management
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
bureau of the apartment of develop
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
and department of environmental services
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
past budget cuts have left it virtually
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
unable to do its job managing
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
the waste and the state properly
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire could construct
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
additional landfill gas to energy
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
facilities in the landfill like friendly
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
said there are two
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
landfills that are ready to uh
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
or it's like very feasible to implement
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
this technology
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
could simulate the economy with job
 
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.790 align:start position:0%
could simulate the economy with job
creations

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
creations
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
and help ameliorate the effects of
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
climate change and lower fuel costs
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire can investigate and update
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
their solid waste hierarchy
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
waste energy is low but the technology
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
around waste to energy has changed a lot
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
recently it's gotten a lot cleaner
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that could be updated um
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire could revisit update and
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
pass new legislation regarding recycling
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
and waste management and encourage
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
more recycling and more diverting waste
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
from landfills
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
um in regard to the glass recycling
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
roads regulated by the department of
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
transportation so that's more state
 
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.430 align:start position:0%
transportation so that's more state
roads

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
roads
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
are except either require the glass to
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
be crushed up so finely
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
um that it's hard for the nra to meet
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
those standards
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
right now they can only meet the
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
standards of roads regulated by the
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services so
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
if the department of transportation
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
regulations were studied and potentially
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
updated to be something that the nra
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
could feasibly
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
meet we could potentially incorporate
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
more recycled glass into
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
roads uh a surcharge could be
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
imposed on out-of-state waste to
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
participate in new hampshire landfills
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that revenue could be put back into
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
waste management in new hampshire
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
and finally new hampshire could continue
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
to partner with
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
organizations like the nri who are
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
coming up with creative
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
solutions to deal with waste management
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
to develop sustainable strategies
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
um and that's all we have and we'll take
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
great thank you both very much kelly i
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh you guys probably looked at the
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that we've been working on
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
currently uh house bill 413 and senate
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
bill 146
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
but have you guys taken a look at those
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
and because we were those are sort of in
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
the area of updating our
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
recycling uh goals did you get a chance
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
to review those
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i have seen those good
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
so we're we're starting to follow some
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
of your recommendations all right
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah uh and i have one question
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
for you as well
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
so you talked about the um the
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
the landfill gas turning it into
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
electricity program
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
so why don't more of the new hampshire
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
landfills participate in that program if
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're able to
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
from my understanding it's they have a
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of a complication deciding
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
what specific technology works best for
 
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.349 align:start position:0%
what specific technology works best for
them

00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
and also a lot of the times they assume
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
that the best technology is the one that
 
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:06.790 align:start position:0%
that the best technology is the one that
fits

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
fits
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
bigger facilities which is like
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
reciprocating engines
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
in reality however it has come up today
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
that micro turbines are actually super
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
helpful for
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
smaller facilities because you can scale
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
up the size
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
and also not waste as much money as you
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
would if you were to build
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
a facility that was far larger than the
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
landfill gas that was generated at the
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
facility itself
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay so it's more of a capital
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
investment issue than a revenue issue
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you all right i'll open
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
it up
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray you have a
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
question yeah i do
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the presentation and
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
having served on
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
a previous study committee in the
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislature i think much of what you
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
were saying definitely resonates so i
 
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.549 align:start position:0%
were saying definitely resonates so i
appreciate

00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
the time that you have taken one
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
question i did have
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the solid waste
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
hierarchy that you mentioned and
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
updating that
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that um that
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
the the state well they
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
the state department of des and the us
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
epa work very closely together and
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
outlining that hierarchy so
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious how
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
how how flexible you feel
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these things are highly
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
regulated at the federal level so i'm
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
just curious what kind of flexibility
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
you might see
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
um a state department amending that
 
00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:33.109 align:start position:0%
um a state department amending that
hierarchy

00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah from our conversation with um the
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
palm beach county waste
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
energy facility we understood that
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
because there has been so many
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
different changes in the technology that
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
they use um with regards to waste energy
 
00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:46.309 align:start position:0%
they use um with regards to waste energy
facilities

00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
things have been more environmentally
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
friendly and the epa has
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
been more open to having it higher on
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
the hierarchy
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
for example i think they have an they
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
had a condensation process
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of the filtering process now
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
just to kind of take the water that is
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
generated from any
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
sorry any excess steam that is generated
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
from the turbines
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
and turn it into waters to reduce any
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
um kelly do you have anything
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
we didn't look at exactly in our project
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think i came across
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
exactly how much of that is
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
federally regulated so i don't think we
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
fully have the answer to that
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
no no problem i appreciate it thank you
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then follow up mr chair if i may
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead um one other question that
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
i did have
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
to your interest in glass and so
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
some of the things i think you were
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
talking about with regard to glass
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
cullet but then it sounded like you were
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
also talking about potential programs
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
around glass bottling and is that
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
something you took
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
a look at as far as feasibility of
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
programs within the state of new
 
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:56.790 align:start position:0%
programs within the state of new
hampshire

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
versus our neighboring states or i'm
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
curious to know if there's more
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
information there
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um so a lot of as i mentioned four
 
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
yeah um so a lot of as i mentioned four
other

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
new england states have these programs
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
um and it's essentially the sort of just
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
like bottle
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
return programs specifically
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
for glass um it seems like a pretty
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
feasible thing on to do
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
it showed in the other states having
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
high economic returns
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
on and there is a market right now
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
for recycled glass it just needs to be
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
clean um and not contaminated with other
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
materials and this seems like a way you
 
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:40.470 align:start position:0%
materials and this seems like a way you
get

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
back much cleaner recycled glass
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much all right
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative erin did you have a
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
question yes i did thank you
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i'd like to direct this to kelly
 
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.349 align:start position:0%
uh and i'd like to direct this to kelly
specifically

00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
you were talking a lot about recycling
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
and as we've seen with china exiting the
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
recycling of plastics market
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know recycling only works if you
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
have an entity or a market
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
place uh who will take the waste to
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
process it
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
so what it what do you suggest
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
to encourage businesses to enter this
 
00:54:23.839 --> 00:54:25.030 align:start position:0%
to encourage businesses to enter this
space

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's been created and and also
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
coupling that with what if there's
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
unsuitable technology to handle those
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
recyclable items
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
like certain plastics i mean we've got a
 
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.950 align:start position:0%
like certain plastics i mean we've got a
problem

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
where we want to encourage recycling to
 
00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:44.950 align:start position:0%
where we want to encourage recycling to
happen

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
but there's no marketplace to bring
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
those items
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
to to convert them to something else
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's usable
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
yeah uh we definitely came across that
 
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
yeah uh we definitely came across that
issue

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
in doing our research with the china's
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
new policy that's why
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
we focused and had that section about
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
glass because we found that was
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
one of the more one of the places there
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
were more
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
feasible solutions um in a
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
better market for honestly we found that
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
you're kind of right that it's a
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
hard time for plastics right now and did
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
not find a lot
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
about um plastic recycling but something
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
else we did find
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
was paper recycling and like as
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
time passes since china's national
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
sphere policy has been passed
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
paper recycling facilities are starting
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
to be built in the u.s
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
um even in the northeast i think in
 
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.950 align:start position:0%
um even in the northeast i think in
pennsylvania

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
um someone we talked to was telling us
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
about how that industry
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
it's taking time to build up the
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but the infrastructure is
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
being built up
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
um particularly for glass and paper
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like plastic recycling is
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
taking a longer
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
time for the markets to respond to that
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
and follow it sure and so do you believe
 
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:05.430 align:start position:0%
and follow it sure and so do you believe
uh

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
the problem there with the plastic
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
recycling is that
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh we're still waiting for certain
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
technologies to emerge
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
that will handle those kinds of plastics
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
in a better way than they've been
 
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.510 align:start position:0%
in a better way than they've been
managed

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
managed
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think so um and for infrastructure to
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
shift and build up in the united states
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
the united states was so dependent
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
on shipping everything to china it's
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
taking some time for
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
those or for the united states to figure
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
out how to handle that
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
recyclables on their own okay thank you
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
so much
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
that was a very very well done
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
presentation by the way and my
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
thanks to all of you who worked on it
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
00:56:58.319 --> 00:56:58.950 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
so

00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh actually this is this is not my
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
question but uh
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan was not able to uh
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
attend today and he had a
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
a question a couple of questions um
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
written uh present written reports
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
and one of them has to do with uh waste
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
to energy
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
and he noted that there's been some
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
issues in europe
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
that um although the
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh the energy conversion technology is
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
working fairly well uh there is an issue
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
with um trace pollutants like dioxins
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the exhaust gases that then get into
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
and bio accumulate and uh
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
he was wondering if you had any more
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
information in terms
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
of uh ways of dealing with um
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
with those uh small but
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
but highly toxic pollutants that might
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
still be coming out of the exhaust gases
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
yeah well our project did not entirely
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
europe's method methodology i will say
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
that something that did come up
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
repeatedly in our conversations with
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
palm beach county the waste energy
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
facility over there was that
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
they implemented an air condensation
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
process at the end of the whole
 
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:15.990 align:start position:0%
process at the end of the whole
incineration

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
incineration
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
process to just ensure that the steam
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
that was coming out that has a bunch of
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
was getting um condensated and turned
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
into water just to reduce the amount of
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions that get
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
emitted into the atmosphere overall
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't have a specific uh
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
way of telling what's going on in europe
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay and uh his other question was
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of diversion strategies and he
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
was wondering
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you had looked at um using specific
 
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:48.549 align:start position:0%
if you had looked at um using specific
ban

00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
ban
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
specific bands like bands on single-use
 
00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:54.950 align:start position:0%
specific bands like bands on single-use
plastics

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we fully got into depth
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
on fans on single-use plastics it's
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
something i
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
came across on a little bit and looking
 
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.510 align:start position:0%
came across on a little bit and looking
at

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
other states policies but not something
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
we weren't super in-depth into in our
 
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.309 align:start position:0%
we weren't super in-depth into in our
report

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is this has been a
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
very both
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
both groups have done a great job on
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
your report so
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh very impressed with your work thank
 
00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh very impressed with your work thank
you

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and i just want to say
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you both for this
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
really relevant uh presentation uh the
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
one question i did have quick question
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
is that you had mentioned that some of
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
the neighboring states around us are
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know they have ambitious goals to
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
reduce their waste
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if those goals
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
also incorporate the amount of waste
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
they ship to other states like us
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
or if they're meeting those goals
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
without accounting for that
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if your research
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
indicated any of that
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so from my understanding
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
from our research it was that
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in particular they are
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
reach a 30 reduction in annual disposal
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
by 2030 and 90
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
by 2050 and i understand that this does
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
include out-of-state ways diverting it
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
they have banned a bunch of different um
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous material and they've also
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
placed the ban on
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
food waste ban which i believe is now
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
getting sent to
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire some of it um and i also
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
know that with regards to vermont as
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
well they only have one landfill
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
and they actually do not take any out of
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
state ways
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that that might also get diverted to
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire because
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
there is no surcharge which kelly
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
probably knows a lot more on
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
yeah no that's definitely an issue
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
cracking down on what and how much can
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
go into their landfills
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of this happens through the
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
private companies
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
casella works in both massachusetts and
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and instead of putting the
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
waste into the
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts landfills is just shipping
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you okay and representative
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
stapleton you have a question
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
did i hear you correctly to say that
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
the waste coming in to new hampshire
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
for in 2018 49 municipal solid waste
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
came from out of state
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up mr chair sure go
 
01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:39.589 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up mr chair sure go
ahead

01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
um vermont seems to be quite a ways
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
ahead of us
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
in controlling the various aspects of uh
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
waste and recycling how much percent do
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
of out-of-state waste comes into vermont
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
and if they've restricted it how did
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
they have not restricted it but we
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
believe it's because there's only one
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
landfill in vermont
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
and it is owned by casella and just
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
because it is such a small state
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's the central landfill for the whole
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
state they i guess they just decided to
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
not take any out of state waste which
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
clearly affects new hampshire because if
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go there it comes here
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and a lot of that is like
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
decisions being made within private
 
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.789 align:start position:0%
decisions being made within private
companies

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
very good thank you okay any further
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chair i did have one question
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative murray
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you guys
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i guess to sort
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
of piggyback
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
on rep stapleton's question and expand
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
on that a little bit
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
did you guys differentiate it all
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
between public and private landfills
 
01:02:55.599 --> 01:02:58.309 align:start position:0%
between public and private landfills
because

01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
i am wondering if some of that
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
information might affect
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
what type of waste is taken in certain
 
01:03:04.799 --> 01:03:05.750 align:start position:0%
what type of waste is taken in certain
places

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
places
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
and what flexibility there is to
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
regulate some of that
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so most of the out-of-state waste
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
we understand is coming i mean is coming
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
into the private landfills just because
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
they have more flexibility of who they
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
what ways they actually accept
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
um it's because of the commerce clause
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
in the constitution itself that the
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
state really cannot regulate
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
a whole lot about what their business
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
endeavors are
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
however there has been a lot of
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
community opposition
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
where these landfills are located just
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
because it's becoming increasingly clear
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
less serving the constituents and more
 
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.150 align:start position:0%
less serving the constituents and more
serving

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
serving
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh looks like we're back for a
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
second round representative
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry just a quick follow-on chair
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh casella since casella is in vermont
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
have vermont doesn't take any
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-state waste then how does casella
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
how does that affect that interstate
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
compact with regard to them since
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
they're private companies
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
we really i i don't think our project
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
really covered that just because it is
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
really hard to
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
find out what is going on in between
 
01:04:20.559 --> 01:04:20.950 align:start position:0%
find out what is going on in between
their

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
their own private business and yeah but
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
from my understanding it probably has to
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
some agreement that they themselves have
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
between themselves that they see this
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
being the most um
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
like beneficial method for them at least
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay so you're thinking that it's a an
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
agreement between casella and vermont
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh or more so
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
casella states can
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
like flat out say we're not taking any
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
waste from out of state i believe that
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
is an issue also with the commerce
 
01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
is an issue also with the commerce
clause

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'll have to do a little more
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
research on that i don't know
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not fully uh understanding of all
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
that but uh thank you very
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
much right uh representative bixby
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
you have another question um this is uh
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
actually a follow-up on
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative homeless question on
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
so um vermont does have
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
some restrictions in terms of organic
 
01:05:27.359 --> 01:05:28.309 align:start position:0%
some restrictions in terms of organic
waste

01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
going into landfills and i think maybe
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
also construction debris
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
and with those bands uh created
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
a disincentive for um
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
for casella to bring in and bring
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
waste from out of state into vermont
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
for other questions for our presenters

[Music]

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
okay it is 10 12. i'm going to bring the
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee back out of recess
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a discussion about the
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
retained bills we have
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
five retained bills that we have kept in
 
01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.149 align:start position:0%
five retained bills that we have kept in
committee

01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we have some time in may
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
available to us that we could work on
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
some of these we can't actually accept
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
anything out of committee until a little
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
bit later into the fall
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
but we can do the legwork on any of
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
these that we choose to now
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
so i kind of wanted to discuss with the
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee about uh
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
what our thoughts were going forward and
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
and kind of share with you
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
my thoughts and uh representative bixby
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i had a conversation yesterday and
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
good news is we were on the same page so
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh this should go fairly easy
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
so uh i'll kind of go through the list
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
and one by one and i'll share with you
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
my thoughts and uh representative bixby
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
and others you're more than welcome to
 
01:12:56.719 --> 01:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
and others you're more than welcome to
uh

01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
jump in and fill in uh with your own
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts if you'd like
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
so house bill 366
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
is the bill right in front of me
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the animal book sorry thank
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
you that is a
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
that bill is one that i sponsored and
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
i asked the committee to retain it
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
originally because i knew there was some
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
more work we wanted to look at
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
especially in the
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice area of it i have
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
reached out to
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
the akc stacey ober and and to uh one of
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
folks uh eileen landis that gave
 
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.149 align:start position:0%
folks uh eileen landis that gave
testimony

01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
and spoken with them about providing us
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
with some thoughts and
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
their recommendations on areas that need
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
some work in the bill too so
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's a bill that we can look
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
at working on this month
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
and uh get some of the uh some of that
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
at least underway even if
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
we can't get to where the committee
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
wants to be completely
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
um so i guess i'll open it up
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative bixby do you have any
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
further comments you'd like to make on
 
01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.950 align:start position:0%
further comments you'd like to make on
that

01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah i think that uh one of the
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
things that's
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
convenient about that for start getting
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
being able to start work on it
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
immediately is that
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
there there are no budget impacts so uh
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
whatever uh whatever
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
is uncertain in terms of the budget
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't really impact how we
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
go about this one and i think that one
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
things that we can do is um think about
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh specific people who would be able to
 
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:30.550 align:start position:0%
uh specific people who would be able to
address

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
some of the uh sticking points that had
 
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
some of the uh sticking points that had
been

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
um that had been raised in the uh
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing and uh bring those in
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
those people in on to help us um as
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
as witnesses in our work sessions
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
my intent is we'll um we'll send this
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill to the
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for animal protection and
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
licensure and
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll assemble that subcommittee and
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
allow that to
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to take a look at it
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
any further comments on this from any
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
other yeah
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
just just for those people who are um we
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%

term
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
so just for those who are new to this
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%

01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
and quarantine requirements for
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
animals imported into the state
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
that again is a bill that i sponsored
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to hold that bill right now
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
i think that there's some other bills
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
going through process that are relative
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
to similar areas and i'd
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
like to let them sort of clear the
 
01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.470 align:start position:0%
like to let them sort of clear the
pipeline

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
before we uh commenced any further work
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill here
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
i don't we i don't think there's
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
anything urgent that needs to be
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
acted upon right now so
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
i think it'll be my request of the
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee that we just hold that bill
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
into the fall and we get an idea of
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
the landscape of where we are with these
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
the database and uh the house bill 250
 
01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:43.990 align:start position:0%
the database and uh the house bill 250
and

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 249 we've got several others
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are working in the same area that
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
i'd like to let them get through any any
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts or comments from the rest of
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
i agree entirely with that thank you
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative dixie
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
all right see none i think that's the
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
way we will
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
proceed okay the next bill is
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 438 that's uh relative to the
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of animal records
 
01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.630 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of animal records
databases

01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
databases
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
this bill as a refresher for the
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee was
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
sort of dealt with a piece of what the
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 532 did that
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative bixby sponsored that we
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
moved forward as a committee and has
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
now been included into house bill 2.
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
this uh house bill 438 just went
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
dealt with one section on
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and it was our agreement
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
as a committee that we would
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
hold on to that bill and sort of keep it
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
as a placeholder
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the event that there were anything
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
that we decided
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
came out of house bill 532 that we
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
needed to fix later on
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
i think right now we're uh we've got a
 
01:18:56.159 --> 01:18:56.790 align:start position:0%
i think right now we're uh we've got a
really

01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
good compromise with the senate on
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
language in what we
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
have put into uh the budget and they're
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
currently looking it over again as they
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
look through the all of hb2 but my
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is we're
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
in a good spot uh being in an agreement
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
on that language so
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
it would be my recommendation that we
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
hold on to this bill of the fall
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 438 and see if there's any
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
further work that we need to do in the
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
any other comments from members of the
 
01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.750 align:start position:0%
any other comments from members of the
committee

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
well you're all agreeable today this is
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh house bill 585
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
this is allowing the prepayment of dog
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for the duration of a
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccination and
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
reducing fines related there too
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
actually representative bixby why don't
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
you speak to this when you and i talked
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
at length about this yesterday
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think that um this one the
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
i think well we decided to retain this
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
because the bill is written had some
 
01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.030 align:start position:0%
because the bill is written had some
problems

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
and uh the
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
but the the idea of potentially making
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
it possible for people
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh to get a three-year license and
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
instead of one year a license has some
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
appeal to it
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's figuring out the details of how
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
that would work
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
and also making sure that
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
whatever we do would be
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
would be workable on the municipal level
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
so i think we're going to need to get
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh some input input from municipalities
 
01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
uh some input input from municipalities
on

01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
whether they would find this useful or
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
beneficial or
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
problematic or whether they would like
 
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:44.709 align:start position:0%
problematic or whether they would like
to

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
have it as enabling legislation rather
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
than a mandate
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
so so those are possibilities um
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i think that uh it we should uh
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
do some more discussion of it um i don't
 
01:20:57.679 --> 01:20:58.149 align:start position:0%
do some more discussion of it um i don't
see

01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
any reason that we would need to wait
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
until the fall to start
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh we have we as a
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee received some uh
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
communication from the bill's sponsor
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative leon that she's very
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
as a committee to looking at and address
 
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
as a committee to looking at and address
the

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
issues and concerns that were raised in
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing and any
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
further ones that we may raise so
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
it is my feeling i'm in agreement with
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative bixby that this is a bill
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we could start working
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
on here in may as well and uh
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
so i i will also assign that to the uh
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on animal protection and
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
licensure and we'll have
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
that bill that they can also take a look
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
at representative aaron did you have
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
some thoughts yeah no i just had a quick
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
question as to
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
um why was three years chosen
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
instead of say two years yeah that's a
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
great question i
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think that'll be a good one to ask
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
when we get into the subcommittee and
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i could actually clarify that
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
um because the uh rabies vaccination is
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
good for three years
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh yeah okay okay thank you
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah there's again i agree there's
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's some real
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
the concept has merit there are just
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
some questions raised and concerns and
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh race and i think we uh
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
we as the subcommittee and as a
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
consequently the full committee after
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
can take a look at that and
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
see if we can come up with a workable
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
path forward or at least some further
 
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.149 align:start position:0%
path forward or at least some further
information

01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
any uh further comments from the
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we'll go on to
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 627
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
which establishes a value-added grant
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
matching fund for new hampshire
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural producers
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative bixby and i talked at
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
great length about this yesterday
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i think i will actually give the
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
floor to him again on this bill he has
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of background and good working
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
information on it so go ahead
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
so um so the this is another bill that
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh where the what happens in the budget
 
01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:07.990 align:start position:0%
uh where the what happens in the budget
budget

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
um will probably have an impact on
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's feasible
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
in to what degree it would be feasible
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
the anything that involves money is
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
obviously has some complications where
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
we would find funding for
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
for this fund is
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
an open question and having the budget
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
settled would give us an easier
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
basis for being able to make those
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
assessments so i think that we should
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
hold off until the fall to um
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
to look at this further i'm thinking it
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
may actually be
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
something where we um decide that it
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
would make more sense to
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
set up a study committee to look into it
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
more deeply in terms of
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
both mechanisms for funding and also the
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
figuring out how the granting works and
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
whether it should be a grant fund or a
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
loan fund
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so um
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think that there are there are also we
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
had some people who testified in the
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing who can
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
probably give us some good input in
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
terms of how we might want to further
 
01:24:18.239 --> 01:24:19.510 align:start position:0%
terms of how we might want to further
develop

01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
develop
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
develop it so i it's got potential but i
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't think we can work on it right now
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative bixby i
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
concur i
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's uh i think that's a wise
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
choice for us as a committee to just
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
hold on to this again a little longer
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
any other comments from members of the
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
all right see none so uh we have two
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
bills then that we will send to the uh
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for animal protection and
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
licensure uh house bill 585 and house
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill 366.
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh we are able to meet on thursdays very
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
freely because there's no
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
other committee meetings on thursdays
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh because of the senate hearings so
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
we don't there's no scheduled hearings
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
on on bills there's only some
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearings
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
is i guess
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
is does thursday's work for those
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
members who will be on that committee is
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
there a specific
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
time that or date that works better for
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think um i'm not sure that uh
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of members uh who are
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
not here today possibly because
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
um it's because of conflict so it might
 
01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
um it's because of conflict so it might
be

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
good to send that as an email to the
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to get a sense
 
01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to get a sense
of

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
um and it might be a matter one thing
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
that might make a difference is whether
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's in the morning or the afternoon
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that might be a better sorted
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
out by email
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
we can do that great idea
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
all right that is all that i had to
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
discuss i just
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of go over those things
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
as a full committee while we
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
were here after the presentation and
 
01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:11.910 align:start position:0%
were here after the presentation and
again

01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh i think the students and did a
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful job in the information that
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
they presented and i'm
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
very thankful that they were able to do
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
that for us
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
anything any further information that
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
anybody in the committee needs would
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
like to bring up before we
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
adjourn yeah um i think howard you and i
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
had talked about
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
possibly getting uh various people from
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
unh particularly from colsa
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
to give give a presentation on how
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
the work they do would have an impact on
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
the work we do in our committee
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you'd had any
 
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you'd had any
more

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
progress in setting up that i haven't
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
it is on my list of things to do i need
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
to uh i need to get on that and see if
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
we can set up a date to do that because
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think it'd be very beneficial for the
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
committee to get that input
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that for those of you who
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
are new that we traditionally do
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
early on but because of the limitations
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
with uh the bandwidth on these zoom
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
licenses i
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't choose to take the time early
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the session because the
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
the time that we had available for it
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
was needed by other committees with an
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
awful lot of early bills
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
so uh we're kind of doing it a little
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
bit backwards this year
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
we'll do we did our hearings first and
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
we'll do our presentations after but
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
i will uh i will work on getting that
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
organized and certainly keep you all up
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
to date
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
anything else from members of the
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
all right well then we will uh adjourn
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
the meeting here at 10 28
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate all of your time and
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be in touch
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
