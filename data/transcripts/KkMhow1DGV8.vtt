166 to pass the same legislation on May
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
18th it was subsequently referred to
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee and retained following
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
its retention in house finance a 7-year
 
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
extension of the granted Advantage was
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
enacted as part of the budget Bill and
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
therefore the fiscal impact of this
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
legislation is already fully accounted
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
for in the state
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.269 align:start position:0%
budget how much does business like this
bill

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
the Bia put this bill this exact bill on
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
its report card recently were published
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the legislative report card which was
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
distributed with a New Hampshire
 
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
Business Review a vote for this bill
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
gave a representative a positive check
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
mark from the Bia a no vote gives you
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
the opposite business wants this bill to
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
pass some of my colleagues have Express
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about long-term costs what if
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government reduces the 90%
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
cost of the program this point was even
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
blur it turns out that we in New
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have already accounted for
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
that one of my colleagues said there are
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
no triggers in the program read the law
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
well while the RSA is silent on issue
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
the accompanying chapter law includes a
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
provision that protects tax taxpayers
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
against this event let me read you the
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
past Mage from current law

eligible adults under RSA 126 AA is less
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
than 90% in 2020 or any year thereafter
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
which the program is authorized then the
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
program is hereby repealed 100
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%

00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
confirmed that this text remains part of

current

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
law some feel the US Congress will
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
surely reduce the 90% Federal share well
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
we'll see but you should be in mind that
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government requires
 
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
accredited hospitals to provide care to
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of their insurance
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
status because of that the rates that
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
the federal government pays through the
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare program take takes into account
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
the amount of uncompensated care that
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals absorb this formula for
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital specific payment uh depends on
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of care and the factor is
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
called disproportionate
 
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
share because New Hampshire instituted
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
the granted Healthcare Advantage Program
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
the amount of the uninsured shortfall
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
has declined dramatically in
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
2014 the amount of uninsured shortfall
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
was 173 million in the latest year that
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
we have data fiscal year
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
2222 it was 67 million a decrease of
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
about 70% any reduction in participation
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
from from States will result in
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
increased uncompensated Care and More
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
payments through the disproportionate
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
share formula so there's a lot of
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
incentive to keep it where it is but if
 
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
I'm Incorrect and the federal government
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
reduces their share even with this bill
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
passing we will immediately have some
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
work to do do together and figure out
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
how to respond because of the
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
trigger s sp263 is sound policy and
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
should again pass this house removing
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
the sunset which effectively that's what
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
passing s sp263 will do allows providers
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
to build the infrastructure and attack
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
attract the workforce necessary to meet
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
our state's needs improving quality of
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
care for
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
everybody there's some risks businesses
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
can live with but pending sunset on a
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
law that may lead a future program
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
discontinuance removes incentives to
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
build the infrastructure to make the
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
program work as well as it can I mean we
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
work well together now but you the
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
future legislatures 5 years from now
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
might not love each other as much as we
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
do so and businesses suspect that's the
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
case and to lose a key part of their
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
investment because there's a political
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
stalemate in a future legislature would
 
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
it discourage the necessary Investments
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
now there are sufficient triggers in the
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
current law through the RSA and chapter
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
law to permanently protect taxpayer
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
interest there will still be bills in
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
future terms to amend or change the
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
program just like every other program we
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
have the medical community the business
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
community and the Senate were wise to
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly support this bill as were
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
we so please join me to vote no on the
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
itl motion so that an ought to pass
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
motion the house senate business
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%

Earth

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
Earth
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
Speaker so I'm going to end up
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
where the gentleman before me started I
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
mean uh yes started we should not make
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion permanent for able
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
bodied residents until we confirm this
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
is the most coste effective way to
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
handle uncompensated care costs the
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
program was intended to be less costly
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
than since the program's Inception we
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
haven't had a good good basis on what on
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
which to do this
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
comparison most recently during Co the
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
federal government prevented anyone who
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
became unqualified to be on Medicaid to
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
be removed from the program this drove
 
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
be removed from the program this drove
up

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
costs only this past spring did the
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
requirement lapse at which time the
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
state could begin removing unqualified
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
recipients from the roles this process
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
is still
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing another issue in looking at
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
costs is that the Medicaid expansion
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
program has been off budget since its
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
Inception and funded by a changing array
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
of dedicated revenue streams and I'm
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to come back to that one of these
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
in particular in just a
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
moment this is in contrast to the larger
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program which is part of our bu
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
anal budgeting
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
process we in this house put the program
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
onto the budget when we passed our
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
budget in the
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
spring but the other body again removed
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
it per our Department of Health and
 
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.430 align:start position:0%
it per our Department of Health and
Human

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
Human
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
Services the 7year extension now in law
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
allows for good
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
competition between Managed Care
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
organizations bidding on the contract
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
renewal in the coming
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
year if we work to get the program on
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
budget in the near future we can better
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
analyze the costs of a new competitively
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
bid contract and now I'll come to where
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have a pretty firm
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
disagreement a final
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
concern is there was a trigger in the
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
early version of the program that would
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
terminate the program if the federal
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
government changed the cost sharing
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
ratio this trigger was removed in 2019
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
2020 now I'll be a little more precise
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
here with the word removed what happened
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
was they so back to the revenue
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
streams it's an
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
everchanging uh set of guaranteed
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
revenue streams that fund this program
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
one of them is funding from The Liquor
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
Commission and what was and the Liquor
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
Commission has generally put in about 5%
 
00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
Commission has generally put in about 5%
of

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
their uh revenues and then if there was
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
a underfunding they would top it up
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
to uh take care of the underfunding what
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
was changed was that was set up that the
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
trigger now is if the lier commission
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
runs out of
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
money then the program will be
 
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
money then the program will be
terminated

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
terminated
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
now if the liquid commission runs out of
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
money the government is
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
gone just so we're
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
clear so this means a potent the
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
potential for this changing on the
 
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
federal government's part of of the
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
sharing means a potentially large
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
state oh as they've done in the past the
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
federal government has changed a lot of
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
program matches as with the Medicaid and
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
others um and child
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
uh special education is another very
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
good example of that where they
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
initially funded it very highly and then
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
they reduced that uh down so please
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair I mean Mr Speaker
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
that's not a good way to start out um
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
and lest I forget I'd like to request a
 
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.829 align:start position:0%
and lest I forget I'd like to request a

division
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
vote okay SB 267 if passed would
 
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
authorize the expenditure of
 
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.950 align:start position:0%
authorize the expenditure of
approximately

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to hire a Dees staff person to
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
study the issue of cumulative impacts in
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
facility pollutant permitting such as
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
the permitting of landfills which emit
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
methane and other landfill gases or
 
00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
industries by reviewing new hampire law
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
and researching possible
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
Alternatives after a two-year study Dees
 
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
would report its findings and
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations back to the legislature
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
unless SB 267 is passed Dees does not
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
have the funding the staff or the
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
expertise to do this important research
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that Dees is not
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
authorized to put any law into place or
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
take any affirmative action on its own
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
by this bill any further action would be
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
left up to the
 
00:43:38.839 --> 00:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
left up to the
legislature

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
$250,000 is a modest amount of money to
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
be appropriated considering what is at
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
stake and that is the health of our
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
citizens which is
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
invaluable New Hampshire can certainly
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
afford this expense at this time the
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
policy position of the house is very
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
clear the environment and agriculture
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee recommended passage
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
unanimously and this body passed s SP
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
267 by a very strong bipartisan vote of
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
302 to 77 we are only deciding on the
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
issue of money today and as we heard
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday there is Surplus and we can
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
$250,000 is a small fraction of even the
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
50 million we decided to um put forward
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
on retirement yes yesterday this
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
expenditure is common sense under
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
current law facilities emitting
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
pollutants hazardous to our health are
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
assessed individually and licensed
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
accordingly this siloed approach to
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
permitting ignores all the other
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
pollutants that may be present in the
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
surrounding air water and soil take for
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
instance a company that uses a product
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
like PAC in
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing most recently such a
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
company was granted a permit that
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
allowed the release of a certain amount
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
of past into the air something many here
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
have grave concerns about under a
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts analysis Dees would
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
look not only at the in entity seeking
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
the permit but also at other pollutants
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the area when it's going through the
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
licensing process so just as an example
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
because this can get confusing let's say
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
that by law the maximum amount of a
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
toxic substance like sulfur dioxide that
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
one company can release per year into
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
the air is 500 PBS and let's say that
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
company X has gotten an air permit
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
allowing it to release 500 pounds of
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
sulfur dioxide a year which is the mult
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
maximum allowable and then company Z
 
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
moves into the same area and it's also
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
permitted to release the same amount
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
because Dees will only look at What that
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
particular facility would emit during
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
the year so no company could be
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
permitted to emit a th000 pounds but two
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
can taken together I don't know about
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
you but I wouldn't want to live in the
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
air in the area that released that much
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the uh pollutant into the air so
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we at least take a look at our
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
laws and see if this approach makes
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
sense it certainly raises questions this
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
bill is fiscally responsible and yes the
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
budget process has passed but we're
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about many bills
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
that have Appropriations this ter this
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
term it's not like this will be out of
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
the ordinary and yes Dees has unrelated
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
staff positions to fill but so do many
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
stat agencies that's no reason to itl
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
this bill ultimately we could save far
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
more by spending
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
$250,000 now including on healthc care
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
and Remediation costs using a more
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach to permitting and
 
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
we'll never know what opportunities are
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
available if we don't appropriate this
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
money at this
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
time I know many of us here are no great
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
fans of government
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
regulations and I don't but I don't
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
think anyone wants to be drinking lead
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
or drinking pasas in their water
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes environmental regulations are
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
needed to protect the public health and
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
the health of our loved ones and our
 
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
children please join me in pushing the
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
red button overturning this itl motion
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
so we can give DS the ability to study
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
the cumulative impacts possibilities and
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
then we as a body can decide how we want
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
to move forward on the best research
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
available it's worth the money and uh Mr
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker I request a division vote thank
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
you you recognize representative
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
Sweeny thank you Mr Speaker and good
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
morning to my colleagues Senate Bill 267
 
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.750 align:start position:0%
morning to my colleagues Senate Bill 267
appropriates

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to force Dees to hire an
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
additional state employee to study
 
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact analysis I'm not going
 
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
to touch onto the slippery slope that is
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
the policy part of this debate and
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
really just stick to the financials this
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
is money that Dees did not request in
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
their budget the governor did not
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
request in his version of the budget
 
00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
when we worked on the budget Dees in
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
front of us did not ask us to put this
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
money into the budget the other body
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
where this bill originated from after
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
passing it on to us did not see the need
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
or the want to put it into their version
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
of the budget and when we vote Voice
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
voted our Miracle state budget last last
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
year we did not have this money in the
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
budget there is a huge slippery slope of
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
adding state government employee

Speaker if I know that the primary task
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
of a legislature is to set clear and
 
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
well-defined limits to a proposal and
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
lacking those limits a law becomes
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
ineffective and results in constant
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
litigation this proposal opens the door
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
for Dees to constantly find ways to
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
expand as cumulative impact is a totally
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
subjective phrase that could never see a
 
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
limit as to what an opponent could

United Kingdom started the global trend

of formalizing vital records in the

1850s um and they started with birth
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
certificates the reason given for this
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
move was for improved documentation for
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
the large amount of immigrants that were

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%

00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
that contain the facts
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
um that were present at the time of a

birth the time date parents' names and
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
location do not change because they're
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
historical facts about the birth the sex
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the baby is recorded based upon

undergone gender reassignment surgery is
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
still a man was still a male when she
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
was born and vice Versa this bill states
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
that a new birth certificate with a
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
different sex than what's on the
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
original shall be created It also says
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
that the new birth certificate will not
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
be required to have a marginal note to
 
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
indicate that there has been an
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
alteration to the
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
record so the original document can't be
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
traced back to determine what it said
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
there would be no way to know looking at
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
it to know that one is looking at a
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
document that has been
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
altered and while I do sympathize with
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
those who wish to change their gender uh
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
to better reflect their lived experience
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
these are Vital Records if one wishes to
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
change their gender on their driver's
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
license or state ID they have that
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
ability and they only need to go to the
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
DMV and fill out a simple
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
form this bill creates a pathway to
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
change the sex on a birth certificate by
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
having a health care
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
professional um sign a form but there
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
are no stipulations on the expertise or
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
the education specialty education of the
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
healthcare professional in this in this
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
specific area of um gender transition
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
nor is there anything to say how long or
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
what the clinical relationship between
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
the patient and the professional are but
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
again birth certificates being Vital
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
Records historical documents should be
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
accurate only in extenuating
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances should they be changed
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate to lower the bar
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
and make it easier for someone to change
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
their sex on their birth certificate
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
than it is for someone to change the
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
parent on a birth certificate in
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
adoption proceedings both are very

know that birth certificates serve as a
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
historical record and they need to
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
remain factual and if I also know that
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow uh Doctor Who has
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
little to no relationship with a patient
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
to sign off on them to change a vital
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%

01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
already handled in the courts where it's
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
more um it's more unbiased and can be
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
weighed by an impartial judge and that
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%

Etc let's stop there for a
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
second we are talking about
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
irreversible transition
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
procedures on
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
children in committee we were told
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
repeatedly by providers and other
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
lobbyists to quote don't worry these
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
procedures on children aren't happening
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in executive session
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
specic spe specific areas on both the
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock and Elliot Hospital
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
websites were referenced where it says
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
quote we offer a wide variety of
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
services for every stage of your journey
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
including gender affirming hormone
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
therapy for adults and adolescents
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
gender affirming surgery including Top
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
surgery bottom surgery and facial
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
feminization surgery so which is it does
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire offer this or not not
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we have a definite answer to
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
this question before passing a bill that
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
provides protections for procedures
 
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
apparently not even happening here yet
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
and if it is happening a lot more
 
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
research should be done as to the Future
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
ramifications and permanent harm that
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
will come as a result of this I have
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
heard story after Story and personally
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
know people who are now adults who had
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
irreversible transition Serv surgery
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
when they were younger and now have
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
severe health issues and struggles and
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
there is no going back for
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
them they are now permanently sterile as
 
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
well I anticipate more stories to come
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
just like these during subcommittee
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
meetings for this bill concerns arose
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
over the
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality of it specifically
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
referencing article 4 section two of the
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution the subcommitte comme
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
initially voted 3 to one to send this
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
bill to interim study for more work to
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
be done on it we don't think making laws
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
that would stop another state from
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
enforcing their own which this bill
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
would do is a good
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
idea there are many other complex legal
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
issues that will arise if this bill is
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
passed that haven't been investigated at
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
all for example consider if parents in
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
another state are in the middle of a
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
custody court case and one parent
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
decides to take the child to another
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
state like ours for transition surgery
 
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
if this bill
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
passes if either one of the parents ends
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
up suing our state to gain access to
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
their child's medical information then
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would PL place in statute that
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
they have no right to get any of
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
that passing hb36 68 at this time would
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
undermine parental rights and set off a
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
chain of legal nightmares because of the
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
Constitutional problems embedded in the
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
bill as written this bill would prohibit
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
obtaining a subpoena of a Minor's
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
medical records and make New Hampshire a
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state for gender
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
transitions for
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
children between the questions we still
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
need currently answered from New
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's medical providers the
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality of this bill and the
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%

Speaker fellow
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
colleagues you suspect that your child
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
is expressing cross-gender Tendencies
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
and is suffering from a gender dysphoric
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
condition you ask the Physicians who are
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
working with you and their therapists
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
who help determine this diagnosis to
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
help you and your child
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
and they decline to help because the
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
state where you live in has made it
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
illegal for them to help you and your
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
child doing so would be considered child
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
AB abuse and the state could potentially
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
take your child away so you search the
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%

what they are thinking about as far as
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
their gender is concerned this allows
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
them to determine if the child is
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
actually experiencing gender dysphoria
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%

it was intended to protect the fam

considered child
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
abuse this bill would block the sharing

of medical treatment information if that
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
it became clear that not only will we
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
need to protect the families from these
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%

01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
anybody that is speaking on this that
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
sensitive and touchy issue and please
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%

wheeler thank you Mr Mr
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker and thank you for that
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
reminder I rise today despite the
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
uncomfortability of this vote because
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
for me it comes down to whether or not
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
kids should be able to get these
 
01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
surgeries and despite the fact that I am
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
a liberal despite the fact that I
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
believe in non-discrimination for Trans
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
people for gay people for queer people
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that I will fight until my very last
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
day until they are recognized as human
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
beings the question before us is whether
 
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
or not children under the age of 18
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
should be able to get these
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
surgeries and I despite being a liberal
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
who believes in those human rights do
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
not think that is the case and when the
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
question is put before me and I spoke to
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
people until 11:30 last night lobbyists
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders people with
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
firsthand experience lived experience
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
experience and I've been speaking to
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
people for the last 4 weeks about this
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
bill the the only argument against it
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
being that this opens the the amendment
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
specifically opens the door to other bad
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
trans bills but folks the slippery slope
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
fallacy I don't think applies here we're
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
talking about whether or not kids should
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
get these surgeries and they should not
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
these are irreversible surgeries and
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that there are medical
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions which are included in this
 
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.830 align:start position:0%
exceptions which are included in this
amendment

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
when people have problems with their
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
genitals that need to be addressed that
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
that should be addressed but but when
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about whether or not kids
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
should get these surgeries I think that
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
goes a bridge too far and I I I will not
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
be signing on to that so I will be
 
01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:39.639 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment and I
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work done in the Health
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services committee they worked
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
very diligently and if you want to watch
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
legislating being done in real time in a
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
really good way I would recommend that
 
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
you watch watch the committee hearings
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill the work session on this
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
legislation because they diligently took
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
all people into account they took all
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
experiences into account and they came
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
up with a legislation that protects
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 18 this is not
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
a question of whether or not you're with
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
the Trans Community this is a question
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
on whether or not you believe children
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
should be able to get these irreversible
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
surgeries so again despite being a
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
Democrat despite being a liberal who
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
believes in human rights I don't think
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
that children should be able to get
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
these irreversible surgeries so I'll
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
take all the heat that comes from this I
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
will be voting for this amendment and
 
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
for otpa if it passes the bill in its
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
original form I think is too broad and I
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
won't be voting for OTP but I will be
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
voting for otpa if the bill passes and
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
for the amendment if it passes and I
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
hope all of you on this side of the
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
aisle who definitely believe in human
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
human rights who believe in protecting
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination would consider the
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
irreversible surgeries that kids are
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
going to be getting if this bill does
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
not pass thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to join me in supporting
 
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment J recogniz representative
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
order the chair recognize representative
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.950 align:start position:0%
order the chair recognize representative
Canon

01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker fellow
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
colleagues the
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
question that we raise is not about
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
surgery it's not about who this applies
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
to it's about why are we considering
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
putting medical procedures into medical
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
law medical science is constantly
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
changing new procedures drugs and
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
treatments are introduced all the time
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
the medical community is constantly
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
learning new ways to care for
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
patients medical professionals are
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
expected to attend conferences and even
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
spend time learning new techniques in in
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
in institutions other than their own
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's their job so what is our
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
job our job is to protect the people we
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
serve statutes are written to protect us
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
now and long term into the
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
future when we consider consider putting
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislation into law we should be asking
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves will this legislation stand
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
the test of
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
time the problem with this
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it's a Band-Aid it's
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
not something this legislature is
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
capable of monitoring or changing as
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
Medical Science continues to
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
change if we had heard testimony with
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment I mean with a about
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
consistent problem with medical services
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
offered to New Hampshire residents by
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire Medical Care
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
organizations and professionals it might
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
be a different problem for us to address
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
but this is not the
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
case we have many excellent care
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire providing
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
their services us utilizing the best
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge skills and tools available to
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
them could they do better sure but
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's their job not
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
ours by the
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
way any youth reaching the age of 18
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
typically won't be approved for genital
 
01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
surgery until they've started hormone
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
treatments for the gender they identify
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
as as well as Implement their future
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
plans as uh living as the gender they
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
are young people are encouraged to wait
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
until the age of 18 to start
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
them their medical professionals and
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
parents need to sign off on the use of
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
these powerful drugs any earlier than
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
18 Insurance approvals may also play a
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
part in this their
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
decisions they also need to start living
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
their life as the gender they
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
identify for at least a year or more
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
during this time they will attend many
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic counseling and Psychotherapy
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
sessions to prove to a licensed Medical
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
Professional that they are capable of
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
safely without considering harm to
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
themselves or to others this is no small
 
01:33:42.189 --> 01:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
task given the social pressures they
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
will have to live through it is much
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
more likely that a young transgender
 
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
person won't receive genital surgery
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
until they reach the age of 20 or
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
older also a
 
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
major part that we haven't even discuss
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
it that controls when these might happen
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
are the cost of the surgical procedures
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
and the willingness of surgeons and
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals to take the risks associated
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
with these proced
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
procedures a personal note I had to
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
submit letters from my therapist and
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
Psych therapist indicating that I was
 
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
ready for this next step even at the age
 
01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:26.610 align:start position:0%
ready for this next step even at the age
of

01:34:26.610 --> 01:34:26.620 align:start position:0%

01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
now each of the three surgeons that
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
interviewed me wanted to make
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
sure that I knew what the procedure was
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
and what it would
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
entail so that they were comfortable
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
that I was ready same thing is true with
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
olds the insurance company also needed
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I had the right
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
letters in place so they they would
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
agree to their portion of the
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%

female to male
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
procedure which the cost is cons
 
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.030 align:start position:0%
procedure which the cost is cons

higher Amendment 2451 H it's a temporary

solution to a problem this legislature

can't solve in the long

01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I want to start off
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
by thanking my colleague from
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
summersworth for how hard and
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
passionately she fights for this
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
issue I would say that it's been
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
challenging to debate this with somebody
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
that you like and respect so much but it
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
makes sure that we keep things to the
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
issues if the medical societies and
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines were still practicing the way
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
that they have up until 16 months ago we
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be having this discussion it
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
used to be that a minor would need to
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
wait until they were 18 for
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
surgery it used to be in the W path
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines that parental consent was
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
required for treatment and it also used
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
to be in the W path guidelines that you
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
needed to have hormonal treatment before
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
surgery sadly in September 20 September
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
of 2022 that changed none of those
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
protections are no are in guidelines
 
01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.390 align:start position:0%
protections are no are in guidelines
anymore

01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
so this amendment significantly Narrows
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
the bill it lays out the reasons why a
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
person should turn 18 before having
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
genital gender reassignment surgery if
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
you turn to page 93 in your calendar
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
you'll find the amendment which
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
explicitly protects reconstruction and
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
removal due to malformation malignancy
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
injury or physical disease surgeries for
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
disorders of sexual development and male
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:21.830 align:start position:0%
disorders of sexual development and male
circumcision

01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
circumcision
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment laser focuses the bill on
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that informed
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
consent requires an understanding of the
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
risks and benefits of the
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
procedure if a parent is told that this
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
procedure is safe and effective will
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
they believe the doctor and sign on or
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
will they ask for that
 
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
evidence in committee the experts told
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
us that was safe and effective but they
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
could not give us the evidence they gave
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
us data on other procedur procures that
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
were in the underlying bill but nothing
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
on genital gender reassignment
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
surgeries I looked at PubMed where all
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
the clinical trials are published to see
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
why there is not a single study on
 
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
children having genital gender
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery anywhere in the
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
world without data we're experimenting
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
on our children while telling their
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
parents that it's safe and effective I
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
so the question you all face here today
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
is very
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
important is it okay to tell parents
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
that this surgery is safe and effective
 
01:38:31.599 --> 01:38:32.589 align:start position:0%
that this surgery is safe and effective
in

01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
children even though there are no data
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
and you would be leading them to have
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
their child unknowingly participate in
 
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.189 align:start position:0%
their child unknowingly participate in
cuttingedge

01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
cuttingedge
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
surgery kids are not small adults and
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
children who have undergone aggressive
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy from a young age which
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
is what would would be needed to have
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
done undergone Crest sex hormones for a
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
while before the age of 18 have a very
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
very different medical history than
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
adults who have undergone this procedure
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's apples and oranges it's not the
 
01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.149 align:start position:0%
it's apples and oranges it's not the
same

01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
thing our Amendment language actually
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
highlights the current lack of data
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
specifically so that if there are
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
published data that show that this is
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
safe and effective in children you will
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
have the wind at your backs to change
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
the law but we need that data first
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're misleading
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
parents should we tell parents it's well
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
studied when it's
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
not or should we put this pause into law
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
and say wait until
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
18 if you agree with me that we need to
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
wait until 18 at least until the data is
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
available please press the green button
 
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:48.920 align:start position:0%

and goes against medical Freedom
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
particularly where patients should be
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
able to decide um whether they get that
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
treatment and which could prevent their
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
suicide which is also irreversible even
 
01:41:43.709 --> 01:41:43.719 align:start position:0%
if that treatment's experimental like
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
many of us might have wanted to try
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%

01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
substitute the government for parents
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
would I press red to vote against this

01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
experts told us and parents that this
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
was safe and effective yet they were
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
unable to provide data because there are
 
01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.750 align:start position:0%

that we've done in this
 
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
house it's going to be a statute that
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be continually monitored for
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
changes by the medical
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
field that's that's pretty hard to do
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%

future this body is going to have to
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
revisit this as changes are made in the

01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
field we may also have to visit other
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
areas too because there are changes of
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
who can get what surgeries and how young
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so we may need to revisit that area
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
as well it isn't just genital surgery
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
that young people
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
get so I encourage
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
you devote
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
no on this
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
bill it's not right for New
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%

and I hope that our young people don't
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
take this message badly because I'm
 
01:45:59.310 --> 01:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about the health of many young
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
on thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
representatives for passing this
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill as I highlighted
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
before until 16 months ago these
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
procedures were prohibited by guidelines
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
so not only are there no data there are
 
01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:28.950 align:start position:0%
so not only are there no data there are
no

01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:46:31.629 --> 01:46:31.639 align:start position:0%
anecdotes we have not yet seen how the
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
new W path guidelines will trickle down
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
into practice of medicine especially
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire traditionally it
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
takes years sometimes decades for new
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines to see clinical adoption
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
especially for surgical procedures if
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's the case here this pause does no
 
01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.149 align:start position:0%
that's the case here this pause does no
harm

01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
harm
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
however the natural course of
 
01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
transgender Health Care has taken a very
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
different path than other Medical
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
Specialties instead of slowly and
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
cautiously adopting
 
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines the great desire to do
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
something anything to help these kids
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
has overwhelmed the medical mindset of
 
01:47:12.669 --> 01:47:12.679 align:start position:0%
slow and cautious
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
adoption I appreciate the concern and
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
commiserate with these kids and their
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
families it's hard nobody denies
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
that but being told something is safe
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
and effective when there's no data and
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to figure out how it
 
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
works on you is not compassionate it's
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
not kind we need to wait we need to
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
pause and earlier this morning on the
 
01:47:43.629 --> 01:47:43.639 align:start position:0%
first bill we debated we heard from my
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of the aisle
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
how we could revisit that bill in the
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
future should the data change
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
our job is continually looking at the
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
rsas and continually updating them as
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessary it's no additional burden to
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
do this and to wait and see do these
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
help or do these harm until then I ask
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
you to again join with me in pressing
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
the green button to pass this bill as
 
01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
amended so we can wait for data and wait
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
for until 18 thank
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
you and I request a roll call vote Mr
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%

clear the motion be the motion before us
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
is a to pass as
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 619 this is a roll
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that medical knowledge
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
evolves and with that Evolution comes
 
01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.709 align:start position:0%
evolves and with that Evolution comes
changing

01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines happens all the
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
time and if I know that there will be no
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
data to
 
01:49:45.149 --> 01:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
review if there is a specific
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition put in
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
place by all of us non medical
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
people and if I trust parents and
 
01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:57.470 align:start position:0%
people and if I trust parents and
medical

01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
providers to provide appropriate
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care would I now press
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
red to defeat this bill so another
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
motion may be made thank
 
01:50:13.229 --> 01:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize representative Lon
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
if I know that telling parents kids and
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
the whole community that a procedure
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
with no data is safe and effective is
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
negligent harmful and could cost
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
children their lives or their future
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and if I know that we adapt our
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
laws all the time and this issue is not
 
01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.790 align:start position:0%
laws all the time and this issue is not
going

01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
away if I know all of that would I press
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
the green button so we can wait until 18

revisit our state recent our state's

legislature and Governor cunu New

by contrast this amendment to House Bill
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
3 396 with its discriminatory stance on
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
biological sex seems to be a step back
 
02:00:58.109 --> 02:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
from these
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%

undermining the protections established
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%

02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
involuntarily the amendment provides
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
that in the above three
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances and in those circumstances
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
only there is a compelling State
 
02:03:33.069 --> 02:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
interest in allowing classifications
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
based on biological sex in order to
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
protect the Privacy rights and physical
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
safety of both transgender persons and
 
02:03:45.069 --> 02:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
others that may be affected by the
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
classification in this regard I have to
 
02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
disagree respectfully with with the
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
prior speaker on the question of whether
 
02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
there is some this is somehow an
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
improper classification and I would ask
 
02:04:00.549 --> 02:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
you to note that unlike racial
 
02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
classifications which are virtually
 
02:04:05.109 --> 02:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
always almost virtually always
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited when dealing with
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
classifications based upon sex the
 
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
doctrine of separate but equal still can
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
be validly
 
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
utilized if that were not the case title
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
nine of the federal uh Title 9 of the
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
Education Act would be
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because it pro it
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
specifically provides that that the that
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
the way in which equality may be
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
guaranteed for example in sports is not
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
that women must be allowed to play on
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
the UNH football team but that there
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
needs to be equivalent equal
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh for women in in in
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%
other sports and for example if if that
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you couldn't draw racial uh sexual
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
classifications in these kind of cases
 
02:04:58.750 --> 02:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
there couldn't be a woman's uh UNH
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
basketball team and a men's UNH
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
basketball team but in fact there are
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
and in fact title specifically allows
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
that because it recognizes that there
 
02:05:11.229 --> 02:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
are some circumstances in which it is
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
valid to classify on the basis of
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
sex the three circumstances covered by
 
02:05:19.549 --> 02:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
this bill are ones when a public body
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
such as a school district or a private
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
company should be able to protect the
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
Privacy rights of both men and women by
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
not allowing the mixes of the Sexes
 
02:05:32.189 --> 02:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
during the inherently private activity
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
of using a laboratory when intimately
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
intimate body parts may be exposed
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
similarly in uh athletic organizations
 
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to determine
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
that it is inherently unfair to allow a
 
02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:49.719 align:start position:0%
trans transgender male to compete
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
against females in sports such as
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
wrestling basketball tennis and other
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
sports where strength speed or endurance
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
matters lastly the special security
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
concerns applicable to Correctional type
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
facilities make it imperative that
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
classifications based on biological sex
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
be allowed in indeed with respect to the
 
02:06:15.790 --> 02:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
latter situations uh Correctional
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
Facilities I should note here that this
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
is one of the very few situations where
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
courts have recognized that even racial
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
classifications may be allowed and it
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
happens in for example in circumstances
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
where there where there are white or
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
black gangs in a particular facil a
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
particular Correctional Facility courts
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
have upheld the ability to to classify
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
to to segregate uh Prisoners based upon
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
their race if they if in fact that's
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect you know phys
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
protect against physical
 
02:06:50.589 --> 02:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
violence for these reasons I urge you to
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
support this amend this narrow amendment
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
to this bill which makes common sense
 
02:06:57.629 --> 02:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
and would be good public policy and Mr

02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that I
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
don't know what the term biological sex
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
in this amended bill or Amendment to the
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill means or how it would be determined
 
02:09:38.189 --> 02:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
or applied and if I further know that
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
nobody here knows what it means because
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's not defined in this bill or
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment or anywhere else in New
 
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute and if if I further
 
02:09:51.069 --> 02:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
know that there are at least four
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
commonly used biological based
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
approaches to defining one sex Each of
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
which objectively embodies more than the
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
two sex classifications called for in
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
the amended Bill and that any of these
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
can classify the same individual in
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
opposite ways at a single point in their
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
life or different points in one's
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
life and if I know that these concerns
 
02:10:17.069 --> 02:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
are not just theoretical hyperbole but
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
that such policy has been used for
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
example to force a transgender male to
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
compete in wrestling as a female based
 
02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
on birth sex in Texas where he
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
ironically became the state's undefeated
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
girl state champion in 2017 and 2018
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
against his will and lastly if I know
 
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
that the deeply personal information
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:49.109 align:start position:0%
 
classifications

02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
classifications
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
correctly is not typically revealed or
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
documented publicly and should not be
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I then necessarily conclude
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
that if enacted this statute could only
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
be applied in an invasive and arbitrary
 
02:11:06.549 --> 02:11:06.559 align:start position:0%
way which could justify completely
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
opposite policy in the same situation
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
literally opening the door to the very
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination that the Republican Le
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and governor
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
cunu passed remind the member this is a
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry not a speech yeah
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
passed a specific law to prevent just 5
 
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
years ago isn't this more than
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient reason to press the red
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%

basic human dignity that our state has
 
02:11:38.549 --> 02:11:38.559 align:start position:0%

sex yeah I believe I I I I believe that
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
biological sex ba I mean basically going

back to my sort of uh high school
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
biology basically means that if you have
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
the XX chromosome you're a woman if you
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
have the XY you're a man and I'm not
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
aware although I'm certainly not a
 
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
scientist that there has been any um any
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh any change to that basic uh that

it the house will be in order and thank
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
you for ignoring the um inappropriate
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
response from our colleagues um can you
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
tell me where in law since you more than
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room could answer this
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
question wherein law that is defined
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I I I I suspect he probably
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
not and you know the but the the if the
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
question is that because it's not
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
defined we can't we can't decide who is
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
a male and who is a female biologically
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
I have to say respectfully you know that
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
has that has been
 
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
deciding uh on on who is a male or who
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
is not and in classifications dealing
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
with that has been something that courts
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
and frankly the public has been doing
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
for centuries so the idea that somehow
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know we now can't do that I
 
02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully I disagree it's just it's I
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
think it's very easy to make that
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
question member does not yield member
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
does not yield we still have a debate on
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
the bill build the motion before us now
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass as amended chair
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.669 --> 02:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
Tura thank you Mr Speaker um I Rise
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
Again in opposition to passing the
 
02:17:20.349 --> 02:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
amended bill um many of the reasons were
 
02:17:20.359 --> 02:17:21.549 align:start position:0%
amended bill um many of the reasons were
stated

02:17:21.549 --> 02:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
stated
 
02:17:25.309 --> 02:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
previously um on the uh discussion of
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh to Echo the discussion
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
you just
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
heard the lack of a definition in this
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill or anywhere in New Hampshire
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
statute and I did search for it um means
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
that the term biological sex can be
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
applied however somebody wishes to do
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
it and the case that I mentioned in
 
02:17:54.429 --> 02:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
Texas um where it was applied based on
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
birth uh sex at Birth was a specific
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
example of the most commonly accepted
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
version of biological sex that it's
 
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
established at Birth if we adopt a
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
definition where someone can do that we
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
are opening the door to the same
 
02:18:12.429 --> 02:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
situation here where we could tell
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
somebody who is uh outwardly a male who
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
has male musculature
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
and male characteristics to be to play
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
on women's teams we could be telling
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
someone who is transitioned and has you
 
02:18:30.509 --> 02:18:30.519 align:start position:0%
know a beard and male musculature maybe
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
even male Galia that they have to use
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
the woman's room because that's how they
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
were born that is why this bill is
 
02:18:41.549 --> 02:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
dangerous this bill leaves the door wide
 
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
open for anyone in the state to
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
basically undo as I said the bipartisan
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
agreement to protect people in these
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
situations from the Discrimination it
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
was said that this doesn't require this
 
02:18:58.750 --> 02:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
application but allows it I'll say it
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't require discrimination but it
 
02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
certainly allows discrimination and I
 
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
think we should really pause before we
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
adopt something that can be applied in
 
02:19:13.950 --> 02:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
any way that someone sees fit literally
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
opposite ways by two organizations right
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
next door to each other
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
that is the reason why and and I will
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
just finally end with the fact that um
 
02:19:24.669 --> 02:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to Chairman Linn's
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
answer to the question that was posed if
 
02:19:29.709 --> 02:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
we go by chromosomes as I mentioned
 
02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
there are about four different ways that
 
02:19:33.549 --> 02:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
this is most likely done chromosomes is
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
one of the four when you when you look
 
02:19:38.669 --> 02:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
at biology there are there's a condition
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
called kleinfelter syndrome which is an
 
02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:42.509 align:start position:0%
called kleinfelter syndrome which is an
xxy

02:19:42.509 --> 02:19:42.519 align:start position:0%
xxy
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
chromosome um so that definition will
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
not hope there's also an XO um
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
chromosomal uh situation and both of
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
these people can can can live in society
 
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
but will not be easily classified and so
 
02:19:58.349 --> 02:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
I think we should step back from what uh
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would would suggest that we do
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker does remember yield
 
02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:03.389 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker does remember yield
a

02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
questions oh no thank no member does not
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
yield member does not yield
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.870 --> 02:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank you Mr Speaker uh uh
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues I I will not belabor uh
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
because I've I think I've said most of
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
what I needed to say before but let me
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
just let me just raise one thing to ask
 
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
you to think about on this whole issue
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
of like whether or not we really can't
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
tell we can't make a classification
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
about whether somebody is a male or
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
female stop and think about that just
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
for a minute suppose that we really were
 
02:20:59.070 --> 02:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
to say that was true wouldn't that mean
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
that in that in
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
protecting uh females for example in the
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
in as as it as the uh
 
02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws apply generally
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
just stop and think about that situation
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
if you were really to accept the idea we
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
can't tell who's a male or who's a
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
female suppose that UNH had a male had a
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
had a basketball team just one
 
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
basketball team and all of the people on
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
it sort of looked like males and acted
 
02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
like males and and was they were playing
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
other male teams and they had no female
 
02:21:34.030 --> 02:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
basketball team and somebody came along
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
and said hey wait a minute you're
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
discriminating this male basketball team
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
you're discriminating could could they
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
say oh hold on wait a minute we don't
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you know that we're
 
02:21:44.349 --> 02:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
males how do you know you can't tell we
 
02:21:46.110 --> 02:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
have you know what on What basis are you
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
making this kind of decision
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
I would respectfully submit to you that
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
if that kind of an argument was made a
 
02:21:54.510 --> 02:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
court would laugh it out of court I mean
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's of course you can make these
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
decisions uh and that and you can make
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
it here also these are three narrow
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which classification
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
based upon biological sex makes sense
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
for privacy protection and safety
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to support the Bill
 
02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
otpa thank
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%

02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I understand that house bill
 
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
396 as amended is turned into a he said
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
said she said issue like it has here on
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
today and if I know the classification
 
02:23:58.349 --> 02:23:58.359 align:start position:0%
of human beings based solely on
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
biological sex in this bill is as
 
02:24:05.230 --> 02:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
impractical as trying to classify a fish
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the ocean as a bird in the sky
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
particularly in a state that values the
 
02:24:14.349 --> 02:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
principles of Live Free or
 
02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
Die then would I wouldn't I wouldn't it
 
02:24:20.349 --> 02:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
be logical and in keeping with our
 
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
state's values of inclusivity fairness
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%

constituents transparency in

government but they don't include
 
02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:09.710 align:start position:0%
government but they don't include
non-public

02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%

continue we ready I'll good
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay so I rise in opposition to the
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
itl house bill 652 will you give you the
 
02:29:47.950 --> 02:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
right to attend a non on public session
 
02:29:51.309 --> 02:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
if you are being discussed and your
 
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
reputation could be as versely
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
affected it protects you from possible
 
02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
false accusations made against you in
 
02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:03.269 align:start position:0%
false accusations made against you in
non-public

02:30:03.269 --> 02:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
02:30:07.389 --> 02:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
session perhaps an accusation made by a
 
02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
public official who just doesn't like
 
02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
the can of worms you may have opened and
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
potentially corruption in the town
 
02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
now if the accusation against you is a
 
02:30:25.830 --> 02:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
crime that needs to go directly to law
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement they are not subject to 91a
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
and they will do their own
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
investigation I know that due process
 
02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
might be way your way to reclaim your
 
02:30:43.150 --> 02:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
reputation or an attempt to write the
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
wrongs done to you but that may be just
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
too late the damage has already been
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
done to you not everyone also has the
 
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
means to hire a lawyer or the time to
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
devote to the long legal
 
02:31:06.309 --> 02:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
process especially since nothing nothing
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
might have happened if you had just had
 
02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:10.190 align:start position:0%
might have happened if you had just had
the

02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to the allegations
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
made against you in the first place
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 652 will allow this process
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps the entire issue could have
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
been cleared with a meeting with no cost
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
to any
 
02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
party now you may need not think that
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is happening but I can assure you
 
02:31:38.910 --> 02:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
that it is and it's coming to your
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it has come to Dairy it has
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
come to pelum it has come to others so
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
let's nip this in the
 
02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
bud if you believe that you have the
 
02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
right to hear what is being said about
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
you behind closed
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
doors and you have the right to speak on
 
02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
your own behalf this is the bill that
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
will provide that for
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
you House Bill 652 will protect the
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
rights and reputation of your
 
02:32:18.750 --> 02:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
constituents the average citizen before
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
they are adversely affected I Ur urge
 
02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:25.479 align:start position:0%

02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Lynn is recognized to
 
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
report thank you thank you Mr Speaker um
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition uh and in support
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the uh as opposition to the prior
 
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
speaker and in support of the itl motion
 
02:32:52.750 --> 02:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
for this bill the right to no law
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
currently allows public bodies to go
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
into non-public sessions to discuss
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
matters which may reflect adversely on
 
02:33:02.429 --> 02:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
anyone other than a member of the public
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
body the original Bill proposed to amend
 
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
this proi this provision to say that
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
before the public body can rely on this
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
section to go into non-public session it
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
must give the person who may be spoken
 
02:33:19.389 --> 02:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
about uh adversely 48 Hours advanced
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
notice the right to be present at the
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
meeting to have Council or a
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative present and to speak in
 
02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
his or her own
 
02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
behalf the problem with this bill is
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
that there are very often good reasons
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
why a public body may need to have a
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
conf confidential discussion without
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
notifying the person is to be discussed
 
02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
adversely that such discussions are to
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
occur the most obvious example of this
 
02:33:49.389 --> 02:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
is where a member of a public body
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
receives information suggesting that
 
02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
someone may have engaged in wrongdoing
 
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
what could be could be criminal could be
 
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
civil but could be some kind of
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing and needs to discuss with the
 
02:34:03.550 --> 02:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
body how to proceed whether to involve
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
the police or some
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory um Authority uh to launch an
 
02:34:11.429 --> 02:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
investigation Etc if the body were
 
02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
required to give notice to the potential
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
wrongdoer in such situations the result
 
02:34:18.429 --> 02:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
could easily be to frustrate the
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
investigation by tipping uh the hand to
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
the wrongdoer in you know much too
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
early supporters of this bill recognized
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
the problem that I just discussed and
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
sought to fix it by a proposed amendment
 
02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
by a proposed amendment which would say
 
02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
that notice must be given only prior to
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
the public body taking a vote or taking
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
action regarding the person in question
 
02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment also
 
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
also uh would would propos listed a
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
number of exceptions to it dealing with
 
02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
certain regulatory
 
02:34:54.319 --> 02:34:56.830 align:start position:0%
certain regulatory
bodies

02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
02:34:59.630 --> 02:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I have to say that although the
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
amendment improves the bill slightly it
 
02:35:06.510 --> 02:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
by by no means fix fixed all of the
 
02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
problems for example even under the
 
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment if the public body
 
02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
were to take a vote to refer a uh uh
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
matter of potential wrongdoing to the
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
police or the AG for investigation the
 
02:35:21.550 --> 02:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
amendment would require that the alleged
 
02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
wrongdoer be tipped off that of that
 
02:35:26.269 --> 02:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
that action was being done again there
 
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
would be grave potential for uh for
 
02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:31.630 align:start position:0%
would be grave potential for uh for
frustrating

02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
frustrating
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
investigations the other point the other
 
02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
problem with this with this bill is that
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment to the bill was
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
made at the last minute without without
 
02:35:45.710 --> 02:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
adequate opportunity for full discussion
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the implica potential implications of
 
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
this so that for example this am the the
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
the the proposal as as suggested by the
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
prior speaker as reflected in proposed
 
02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is really much more than a
 
02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
right to know Bill it it it in effect is
 
02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
a sort of due process bill it is
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
designed to give people who maybe some
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
adverse action may be taken against
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
notice and an opportunity to be heard on
 
02:36:19.630 --> 02:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
a on a at a you know at a very 50,000
 
02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
foot level that sounds like a good idea
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
in fact and I can I could support that
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
in fact in another context I have a bill
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
coming up in uh before the new session
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the legislature dealing with dealing
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
with due process rights in educational
 
02:36:36.349 --> 02:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
in the educational setting so I'm a
 
02:36:39.309 --> 02:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of due process rights
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
the problem is that this bill has and
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
the proposed changes that arguably could
 
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
have some Merit
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
have not been thought out we we haven't
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
had any hearings on which people have
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
said well look if you if you if you
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
proceed in the way the proponents of the
 
02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
amendment have said here are some of the
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
problems we may have we don't know what
 
02:37:01.710 --> 02:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
those what those problems might be
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
because we haven't heard from Witnesses
 
02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with with with that issue so I
 
02:37:08.309 --> 02:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm really saying in bottom
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
line is I think we need to itl this bill
 
02:37:13.389 --> 02:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
because it's not really ready for prime
 
02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
time maybe at in some fure future legisl
 
02:37:19.710 --> 02:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
legis uh legislation it may be
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to to have something like
 
02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
this that says you know there's a
 
02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
there's a sort of statutory right to doe
 
02:37:31.150 --> 02:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
process uh hearing and right to be be
 
02:37:33.389 --> 02:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
notified and have and uh be heard and
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
have an attorney in certain
 
02:37:37.150 --> 02:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances but we need to know all of
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
the parameters of that before we vote on
 
02:37:42.269 --> 02:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
it and right now this is not where
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
that's not where we are so for those
 
02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to support the itl
 
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh thank you Mr
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker will the member Yi to a question
 
02:37:56.110 --> 02:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:56.120 --> 02:38:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:38:00.349 --> 02:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:03.309 --> 02:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for uh yielding
 
02:38:05.790 --> 02:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
to the question
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
um so my my question is what kind of
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
action it mean I support due process and
 
02:38:15.269 --> 02:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's why at least on the surface I
 
02:38:18.190 --> 02:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
like the Bild but I know I understand
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
the problem of authority investigation
 
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
so you know in a police investigation
 
02:38:24.429 --> 02:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
for criminal thing that is private and
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
then if they decide to charge you then
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
that you have your due process and you
 
02:38:31.469 --> 02:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
can respond for a body like a let's say
 
02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
a board of selectman or a city council
 
02:38:37.309 --> 02:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
can they take action without you having
 
02:38:39.389 --> 02:38:39.399 align:start position:0%
a chance to
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
respond um or is it just that it's
 
02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
private until they decide what they want
 
02:38:47.950 --> 02:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:50.269 --> 02:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
that's no I mean I think really you
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
identify one of what I think is really
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
the the big one of the big problems with
 
02:38:56.910 --> 02:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
the bill as it now is as it now is even
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
with the proposed amendment it doesn't
 
02:39:02.830 --> 02:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
Define what action means so does is is
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
if let me give you this example suppose
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
a selectman receives information from a
 
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
constituent that somebody let's say
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
somebody that the city or the town is
 
02:39:16.510 --> 02:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
Contracting with may have double build
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
or may have uh not provided U not been
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
doing the work that they were supposed
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
to do and the selectman decides I want
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
to I want to have a discussion with
 
02:39:29.309 --> 02:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues at the next selectman's
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
meeting about this uh to decide what to
 
02:39:34.510 --> 02:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
do should they have should that have
 
02:39:36.510 --> 02:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
should the person have to be notified of
 
02:39:37.469 --> 02:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
that where there might be some
 
02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing or isn't it appropriate to be
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
able to have that discussion privately
 
02:39:45.630 --> 02:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
first now if the if the if the board of
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
selectman decides well yes you know
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to refer this to uh uh for
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of further investigation and
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
in fact the further investigation leads
 
02:39:57.389 --> 02:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
to a civil suit being filed or a
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
criminal of course the person has to be
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
has the right to be notified but this I
 
02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
I think would would would require notice
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
problem question before the house is on

amendment
 
02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
morning I rise in opposition to this
 
02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to be clear this amendment
 
02:43:50.670 --> 02:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
would fully replace um House Bill three
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
232 um as would the next amendment that
 
02:43:57.309 --> 02:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
we'll be talking about um I oppose this

02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
defeats what house bill 232 was intended

Hampshire Department of lab labor safety
 
02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%

02:44:39.790 --> 02:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
incomplete the whole purpose of this
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill is to improve upon those standards
 
02:44:45.389 --> 02:44:45.399 align:start position:0%

02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
employees this amendment was well-
 
02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
intended it was trying to make something
 
02:45:01.710 --> 02:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
that was highly
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
palatable it became so palatable that it
 
02:45:05.950 --> 02:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't really do
 
02:45:08.910 --> 02:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
anything um
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
basically it allows the Department of
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
Labor to uh hire three more employees
 
02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of rul making the
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
department can write rules to improve
 
02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:23.479 align:start position:0%

02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
are there are in rules
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
presently the problem is the department
 
02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:30.110 align:start position:0%
presently the problem is the department
has

02:45:30.110 --> 02:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%

02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't require any
 
02:45:45.070 --> 02:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
improvements to the safety state
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
standards for public sector
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
employees department has made it clear
 
02:45:53.950 --> 02:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
and I had a discussion with the um
 
02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner for the Department
 
02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:56.950 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner for the Department
of

02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:46:00.269 --> 02:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
Labor she indicated that this bill if
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
amended in this fashion doesn't require
 
02:46:06.030 --> 02:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
them to do anything further with regard
 
02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
to safety standards gives them three
 
02:46:10.429 --> 02:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
more employees to write rules but
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's no incentive or requirement to
 
02:46:16.590 --> 02:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
actually write those rules
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to oppose this amendment
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
and consider a new amendment that
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually will improve workplace safety
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
for public sector employees thank
 
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
you representative infant signes
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak in support of the
 
02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr Speaker OSHA
 
02:46:39.630 --> 02:46:39.640 align:start position:0%

02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
administration enacted in April of
 
02:46:46.710 --> 02:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
1971 for private
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
employers every private employer must
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
now adhere to OSHA
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
standards however most people don't
 
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
understand that states and
 
02:46:58.990 --> 02:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities do not have to follow
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
OSHA they've had their own standards a
 
02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
few states do follow ocean
 
02:47:07.710 --> 02:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
now but a vast majority do
 
02:47:11.429 --> 02:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
not the New Hampshire Department of uh
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
labor for years has adjudicated safe
 
02:47:18.429 --> 02:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
safy they put out a manual they inspect
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
they investigate accidents and it's all
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
being done with the Department of
 
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
Labor now I am in support of doing
 
02:47:28.990 --> 02:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
to update where we need to be on safety
 
02:47:33.950 --> 02:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Labor in the
 
02:47:35.469 --> 02:47:35.479 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it has been 10
 
02:47:38.990 --> 02:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
years it is time it is time to update
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
where we are with
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
safety the other proposal
 
02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:45.550 align:start position:0%
safety the other proposal
is

02:47:45.550 --> 02:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh a division of Osha 1910 don't know
 
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
what it stands for it's not a date it's
 
02:47:55.870 --> 02:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
just a number it's a th000 pages
 
02:47:58.269 --> 02:47:58.279 align:start position:0%
long I had to get permission from the
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
speaker's office to print it so I could
 
02:48:04.590 --> 02:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
start reading it because I wanted to
 
02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
know what was in it before it passed it
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to read it I've also talked
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
to Department of uh Public Works in my
 
02:48:18.349 --> 02:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
city ad Manchester and to paraphrase him
 
02:48:20.429 --> 02:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
it's like why is a legislature meddling
 
02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
in this why are you getting involved we
 
02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
are not safety experts I'm OSHA 10
 
02:48:28.990 --> 02:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
certified okay so I sat for 10 hours and
 
02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
I got certified on safety I doesn't make
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
me an OSHA expert I'm an insurance agent
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
I spous safety on construction sites in
 
02:48:39.309 --> 02:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing plants I'm not an
 
02:48:41.590 --> 02:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
expert and none of us are it belongs
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
with the Department of
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
Labor the the uh also technology and
 
02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
other things municipalities are doing
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
things on their own the city of
 
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester uses toter now and the
 
02:48:55.309 --> 02:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
Machine picks up to take the trash it
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
has reduced workers comp claims by 50%
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester we are
 
02:49:04.670 --> 02:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
utilizing these things the Department of
 
02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
Labor complains a little bit about not
 
02:49:08.590 --> 02:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
having enough
 
02:49:13.269 --> 02:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
money they receive funding from workers
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
compensation policy another
 
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
things and they have an excess of over
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
$3 million a year in their budget that
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
goes to the general
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
fund well we we're either over taxing
 
02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
people or we should utilize the money
 
02:49:30.910 --> 02:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
for safety we're going to have the
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:37.309 --> 02:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
later I want the Department of Labor to
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
go back and to do what they were doing I
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't want the legislature every four
 
02:49:46.229 --> 02:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
five 10 years to establish safe
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
protocols that's what the department
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
should do so this allots a certain
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
amount of money for them to hire some
 
02:49:55.950 --> 02:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
people and and go do what needs to be
 
02:49:58.190 --> 02:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
done there are a lot of other states in
 
02:50:01.229 --> 02:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
this country that have manuals I got to
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
believe when they go to these
 
02:50:03.950 --> 02:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
conferences all over the
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
country that they can get other manuals
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
and look and see what other states who
 
02:50:09.990 --> 02:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
have updated their safety manuals and
 
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
bring that to New Hampshire I think that
 
02:50:14.269 --> 02:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
is the New Hampshire way that's why I
 
02:50:15.630 --> 02:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
would like you to
 
02:50:18.670 --> 02:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
support my Amendment it's not perfect it
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell the Department of Labor you
 
02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
must do this this and this there are
 
02:50:24.510 --> 02:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing it it gives them
 
02:50:28.990 --> 02:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:34.110 --> 02:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
29h division's been requested this will

02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
believe the safety standards for public
 
02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
sector workers should be updated and if
 
02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
I know that HB 232 is written to require
 
02:52:04.030 --> 02:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor to improve these
 
02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:05.070 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor to improve these
safety

02:52:05.070 --> 02:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
standards and I know that this amendment
 
02:52:09.630 --> 02:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
does authorized three additional
 
02:52:10.990 --> 02:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
full-time positions within the
 
02:52:13.710 --> 02:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor however if I know
 
02:52:15.309 --> 02:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
that this amendment does not require the
 
02:52:17.150 --> 02:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
department to actually improve safy
 
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
safety standards would I now vote
 
02:52:20.190 --> 02:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
against the amendment by pressing the

traditional Town meetings and two towns
 
04:21:24.960 --> 04:21:26.429 align:start position:0%
traditional Town meetings and two towns
with

04:21:26.429 --> 04:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
sb2 one negative of sb2 is the reduced
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
power of the electorate with regard to
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
budgets how so in town meetings you can
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
adjust budgets by up to 10% which is
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
nominally the same as sb2 municipalities
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
however with sb2 municipalities the
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
default budget is like an anchor for
 
04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
which the further you deviate up or down
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
from the default the more likely the
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
default is to be chosen by the voters
 
04:21:57.149 --> 04:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
and the default is chosen by us in
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
conquered not the
 
04:22:02.590 --> 04:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
municipality one budget Committee Member
 
04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:05.119 align:start position:0%
in my town resigned because they
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
determined that the default
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
calculation is wholly undermining the
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
work the committee work of the budget
 
04:22:16.510 --> 04:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
Committee in our town conquered has set
 
04:22:17.830 --> 04:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
the default
 
04:22:21.550 --> 04:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
calculation to be simple however that
 
04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
Simplicity does not lend itself to
 
04:22:24.680 --> 04:22:26.269 align:start position:0%
Simplicity does not lend itself to
accuracy

04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
accuracy
 
04:22:31.630 --> 04:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
um for uh accuracy of the actual need to
 
04:22:35.070 --> 04:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
continue the services for example in my
 
04:22:36.990 --> 04:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
town the administrator tried to set the
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
default budget for the fuel line to be
 
04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
the need for the fuel to heat the town
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
buildings and since she knows that
 
04:22:47.670 --> 04:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
inflating the numbers in the budget
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
makes it harder to get those budgets
 
04:22:52.830 --> 04:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
passed however I informed her that
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
conquer doesn't allow setting up the
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
default budget to the actual projected
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
cost when there's no contract agreed by
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
the voters and must stay the same
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
request as in the default budget that
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
another um is well this bill does not
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
try to address the forecasting of fuel
 
04:23:20.070 --> 04:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
cost but the common uh but a known
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
amount the cost of the current working
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
staff to provide the the government
 
04:23:28.750 --> 04:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
services approved by the voters in the
 
04:23:31.630 --> 04:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
prior year a cursory glance might lead
 
04:23:33.309 --> 04:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
you to believe that keeping the same
 
04:23:35.910 --> 04:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
amount approved by the voters the prior
 
04:23:38.670 --> 04:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
year would be quite accurate however let
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
me give you a couple of examples imagine
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
you're hiring a new position and the
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
voters pass the maximum amount that they
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
would like to pay for that being
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and let's say it passes by the
 
04:23:54.910 --> 04:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
voters and they all agreed to that now
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
if the person is actually hired in the
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.590 --> 04:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
$100,000 they work for the entire year
 
04:24:06.750 --> 04:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
the next default budget comes up
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
or the next budget process comes up the
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
budget committee knows it's going to
 
04:24:10.680 --> 04:24:11.389 align:start position:0%
budget committee knows it's going to
cost

04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
$100,000 the select board knows it's
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 the taxpayers know that it's
 
04:24:17.790 --> 04:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
04:24:22.109 --> 04:24:22.119 align:start position:0%
$100,000 the default budget is still the
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
$150,000 because conquered
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
CHS another example is if a long ten
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
tenured employee is getting paid
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
$150,000 retires and you hire a new
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
employee that is not as experienced and
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
they they pay is only $100,000 they've
 
04:24:40.510 --> 04:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
worked they're employed in that
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
position everyone knows once again the
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the Selectmen everyone knows
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost $100,000 to fulfill
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
those needs of the community but conquer
 
04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
has decided that it should be
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
$150,000 in the default budget so just a
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago I asked my my local school
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
board about why a salary
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
line uh in the default budget was way
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
higher than they were asking
 
04:25:11.469 --> 04:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
for um in their proposed budget when the
 
04:25:15.670 --> 04:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
school uh they responded quote the
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
default budget calculation is calculated
 
04:25:20.030 --> 04:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
by taking last year's appropriation and
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
multiplying it by the contractual
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
increase in the CBA the difference in
 
04:25:27.389 --> 04:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
the proposed budget reflects the actual
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
reduction in salaries and benefits due
 
04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
to turnover the default cannot be
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
calculated using actual reductions and
 
04:25:37.469 --> 04:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
costs because it's a a statutory formula
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
that is based on last year's
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation they went on to say quote
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
we are requesting exactly what we
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
need in the proposed budget the default
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
budget is not a budget request it's a
 
04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
statutory formula and the default budget
 
04:25:54.990 --> 04:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
in this case is higher because the cost
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
of the more expensive employees are part
 
04:25:59.070 --> 04:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
of last year's appropriation which gets
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
carried over in the default budget
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
unquote as you know the passage of
 
04:26:06.070 --> 04:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal Bud budgets is in large part B
 
04:26:08.349 --> 04:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
based on the mutual trust between the
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
governing body and the
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
voters and when the default budget
 
04:26:16.030 --> 04:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
reflects known overstatements in cost
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
and neither the town vote town or the
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
voters can do anything about it it it
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
erodes that
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
trust and so for those reasons ple I ask
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
you to please vote no on itl so that we
 
04:26:31.710 --> 04:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
can incorporate the known costs of these
 
04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
current employees into the default
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
budget so that the default budget May
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
more ACC accurately reflect the known
 
04:26:40.510 --> 04:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
needs instead of an overly simplistic
 
04:26:43.469 --> 04:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
one in statute now thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
a member yield the
 
04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
questions sure remember yields May
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr Speaker and uh
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative would you
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
believe that in the town of Deerfield it
 
04:26:59.950 --> 04:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
has been over a decade since we passed a
 
04:27:03.109 --> 04:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
proposed Municipal budget and that in
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
that decade under default budget
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
there have been increases every year
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
that have kept pace with
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
inflation and we have res we have
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
returned a healthy operating Surplus
 
04:27:22.429 --> 04:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
back to the taxpayers under default
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
budgets every year except for one would
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
interesting thank you for the question I
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
do find all your anecdotes quite
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
interesting thank
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
Harland thank you Mr
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker oops is that
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
better a transparent Municipal
 
04:28:02.349 --> 04:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
budget is that better all
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
right okay all right uh a trans parent
 
04:28:09.309 --> 04:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal budget process that engages
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
residents of your community uh and
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
clearly explains why a budget makes both
 
04:28:17.950 --> 04:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
long-term and short-term sense is
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
essential to building the trust and
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
support that's needed to pass a budget
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are times when the
 
04:28:27.990 --> 04:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
local governing body and the voters are
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
not on the same page and the budget is
 
04:28:34.269 --> 04:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
rejected and the default is adopted no
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
Community wants to find them elves in
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
this position it's incredibly
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
challenging the default budget allows
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
the municipality to continue to operate
 
04:28:46.990 --> 04:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
it pays the wages or the salaries of the
 
04:28:49.950 --> 04:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
employees and it meets the contractual
 
04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
obligations of the community but it
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
strips out any one-time expenditures for
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
example like your vehicle replacement
 
04:29:00.830 --> 04:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
program your Capital Improvement program
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
and potentially your road programs are
 
04:29:03.239 --> 04:29:04.269 align:start position:0%
and potentially your road programs are
all

04:29:04.269 --> 04:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:29:09.149 --> 04:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
paused so the local governing body is
 
04:29:12.269 --> 04:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
faced with trying to come up with a
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
budget over the next year and get the
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
community on board again it's a really
 
04:29:21.550 --> 04:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
challenging process House Bill 313 makes
 
04:29:24.149 --> 04:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
that challenging process much more
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
difficult by having the state step in
 
04:29:30.429 --> 04:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
and limit the ability of a Lo local
 
04:29:33.710 --> 04:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
municipality to solve their own problems
 
04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
it it states as was already brought up
 
04:29:41.790 --> 04:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
that if a employee that is hired before
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
the public hearing of the proposed
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
budget if their salary is less than the
 
04:29:50.070 --> 04:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
budgeted salary the default budget would
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
reflect that so the example would be if
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
we were going to hire a public works
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
director and the salary was
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and the actual salary that we
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh gave to them was
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
$80,000 the default budget would then
 
04:30:06.349 --> 04:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
reflect the $80,000
 
04:30:10.830 --> 04:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
salary and the bill alleges that this
 
04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
money is being used to pad the default
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
budget in reality every municipality has
 
04:30:22.990 --> 04:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to use unexpended funds so
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't use your fuel it's a warm
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
winter and you aren't plowing or an
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
employee costs less than is needed all
 
04:30:32.790 --> 04:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
of those unexpended funds go into the
 
04:30:35.710 --> 04:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
fund balance the municipality can then
 
04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
decide whether to use those funds to
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
drive down the tax rate or as occurs
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
each year when you guys H when the
 
04:30:46.830 --> 04:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
municipality has an audit some of those
 
04:30:48.990 --> 04:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
funds are held in reserve in case
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
unexpected things come up the municipal
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
and County government majority felt that
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
house bill a house bill
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
313 really strips municipalities the
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
ability to solve their own problems it
 
04:31:06.109 --> 04:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
dictates how they can spend their
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
funds therefore we recommended that this
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
bill should be in expedient to
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
legislate we hope that Representatives
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
will support their local control and
 
04:31:18.429 --> 04:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
follow the the recommendation of the
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill simply includes
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
actual salary and benefit reductions
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%

list of Provisions in statute used to
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
calculate the default budget and if I
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
know that this will result in a default
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
budget that more accurately reflects the
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
true dollar amount needed to be raised
 
04:33:21.390 --> 04:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
and appropriated through taxation

04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:33:50.670 --> 04:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the governing
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
body of a political subdivision of the
 
04:33:55.949 --> 04:33:55.959 align:start position:0%
state must clearly inform the public of
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
what and why there monetary differences
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
between a proposed budget and a default
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
budget in performing their fiduciary
 
04:34:07.150 --> 04:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
duties and and if I know that every
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
local government has different needs at
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
different times than another but their
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
voters and residents expect their level
 
04:34:18.029 --> 04:34:18.039 align:start position:0%
of service to remain and if I know the
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
quote commitments unquote described in
 
04:34:23.310 --> 04:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report can hamper those
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
continued Services by flattening the
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
capability of hiring retention
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
recruitment due to unanticipated
 
04:34:34.590 --> 04:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
retirements leaves of absence and Market
 
04:34:37.709 --> 04:34:37.719 align:start position:0%

04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%

keeping a record of all monuments in the
 
04:37:51.150 --> 04:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
state this bill is unnecessary and
 
04:37:54.429 --> 04:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
flawed basic definitions are missing
 
04:37:57.629 --> 04:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
such as the definition of
 
04:38:00.670 --> 04:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
monuments this can result in significant
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
confusion and different
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
interpretations testimony was received
 
04:38:08.750 --> 04:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill and a list of monuments
 
04:38:11.709 --> 04:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
can be collected from cities and towns
 
04:38:14.429 --> 04:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
and posted on the website the director
 
04:38:17.109 --> 04:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
of division of historical resources said
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
via email he could do it now without
 
04:38:22.990 --> 04:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
additional funding the minority believes
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
this bill as presented to the house is
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
not ready for passage the minority is
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
supportive of the idea of this bill but
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%

04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
Gera thank you very much Mr Speaker uh
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
if we only had a nickel for every time
 
04:38:54.269 --> 04:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
someone stood in this well and and uh
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
said that this is a very simple Bill uh
 
04:38:59.230 --> 04:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
it's right up there with I'll be brief
 
04:39:01.390 --> 04:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh but in this case I I really mean
 
04:39:03.150 --> 04:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
it this is a very very simple Bill to
 
04:39:05.629 --> 04:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
have the state compile and maintain a
 
04:39:08.109 --> 04:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
list of all publicly maintained
 
04:39:10.269 --> 04:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
monuments in the state and I want to
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
address a couple of the concerns that
 
04:39:13.629 --> 04:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
were just raised by the previous speaker
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
and that were raised in committee first
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
of all the bill provides a precise
 
04:39:19.949 --> 04:39:19.959 align:start position:0%
definition of The Monuments to be put on
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
this list by stating that these are
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
publicly maintained monuments every
 
04:39:28.590 --> 04:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
municipality in the state has a list of
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
monuments that they maintain uh and the
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh division of historical resources
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
would simply ask for that list they
 
04:39:38.350 --> 04:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
would receive the list and would go on
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
the list so uh the what constitutes a
 
04:39:44.350 --> 04:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
monument is precisely defined by the
 
04:39:47.070 --> 04:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying term publicly
 
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
maintained second of all with regard to
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
the necessity of this bill the testimony
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
by email that my uh esteemed colleague
 
04:39:57.510 --> 04:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
just referred to uh the the director of
 
04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
that division also made it crystal clear
 
04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
to the committee that in order for this
 
04:40:05.230 --> 04:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
to be maintained every 10 years that
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
requires a statutory change but I think
 
04:40:09.270 --> 04:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
we can all agree with changes in
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislatures changes in directors and
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
other employees at agencies that it is
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
important if we want something to be
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
updated and to be maintained that we uh
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that we make proper provision
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
for that uh what my hope here with this
 
04:40:25.030 --> 04:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
list as a historian uh I would love it
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
if anybody here who wanted to visit all
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the war memorials for example in the
 
04:40:31.150 --> 04:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you go to one
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
place on uh State of New Hampshire
 
04:40:35.230 --> 04:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
website you can find out where all those
 
04:40:37.150 --> 04:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
War memorials are and you can travel
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
around the state and see all of those
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
great sites for yourself uh and as an
 
04:40:43.948 --> 04:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
educator I also see this as a valuable
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
tool for us to uh instill uh in our
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
students and our young people uh love of
 
04:40:52.390 --> 04:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
place love of this great state of the
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
people and uh the cultures of the
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
Granite State so for all of those
 
04:41:01.868 --> 04:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
reasons I ask you all to uh vote otpa on

inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill is
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
seriously flawed and has the distinct
 
04:42:30.910 --> 04:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of requiring funding to make
 
04:42:30.920 --> 04:42:31.708 align:start position:0%
possibility of requiring funding to make
it

04:42:31.708 --> 04:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:42:35.430 --> 04:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
viable and if I know that the director
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
of historical resources supports the
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill and has stated that the tasks
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
required could be done by him without
 
04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
legislation and with no additional
 
04:42:48.400 --> 04:42:50.270 align:start position:0%
legislation and with no additional
funding

04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:42:55.150 --> 04:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
then we should itl the bill as it is not
 
04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
needed press the red button thank
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%

04:43:32.190 --> 04:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill will provide a tremendous
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
resource to all students and teachers in
 
04:43:37.350 --> 04:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and if I know that it
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
requires no funding as a division of
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
historical and cultural resources
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%

finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:43:48.190 --> 04:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
requiring the department to update the
 
04:43:51.708 --> 04:43:51.718 align:start position:0%

04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%

to agree with the majority Report with a
 
04:46:18.430 --> 04:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
04:46:20.310 --> 04:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
pass Senator Michael Harington from the
 
04:46:22.110 --> 04:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee chair
 
04:46:26.830 --> 04:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.230 --> 04:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr Speaker I
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
suppose I had to start out by saying
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
what is useful thermal energy from
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
having discussions with many many reps
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
on this I realize there's a lot of you
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
who have no idea what that term means
 
04:46:40.830 --> 04:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
and what I'm talking about so if you
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't know think about how many you
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
constituents know I would guess the
 
04:46:46.948 --> 04:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
number is pretty close to zero so how do
 
04:46:48.750 --> 04:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
we get to useful thermal energy in the
 
04:46:52.110 --> 04:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
law well back a few years ago a wood
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
ship manufacturer had very good lobbyist
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
and they were able to get a law passed
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
to expand the renewable portfolio
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
standard which deals with renewable
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
electric production to include furnaces
 
04:47:05.788 --> 04:47:05.798 align:start position:0%
that burn wood these are large scale
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
industrial furnaces that use wood to
 
04:47:09.990 --> 04:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
produce their heat rather than oil or
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
natural gas there's nothing in here that
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
reduces the use of electricity
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it simply reduces the use of
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
other forms of heating which is
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
basically limited to oil and natural gas
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
and we're talking industrial siiz
 
04:47:24.670 --> 04:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
facilities here so someone puts in one
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
of these industrial siiz wood burning
 
04:47:28.830 --> 04:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
furnaces and for every equivalent
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour of energy they produce
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
they get a wreck the same as a solar
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
producer gets a wreck who produces solar
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
electricity or someone who produces
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
electricity from wind gets a wreck now
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
these wrecks have to be bought by the
 
04:47:44.310 --> 04:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
electric utilities again this has got
 
04:47:45.910 --> 04:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with electric production
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but the electric utilities
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
have to buy these wrecks they forced by
 
04:47:52.030 --> 04:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
laws to do it just like they have to buy
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
the wrecks that come out of solar energy
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
small hydro and wind power so the
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
electric utilities by these Recs what do
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
they do with them they don't eat the
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
cost they bury them in rates and they're
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
passed on to your rate payer so again if
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
you were to go out and ask your
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
constituent how many people know that my
 
04:48:10.990 --> 04:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
electric bill is higher so I can afford
 
04:48:12.990 --> 04:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
so someone else gets the subsidy for
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
large industrial wood burning boilers
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say probably no one
 
04:48:19.390 --> 04:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
unless you happen to have a constituent
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
that owns one of those industrial
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
furnaces the answer is going to be zero
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
so here we have a subsidy that's buried
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
in electric rates that has nothing to do
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
with electric production it doesn't
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
increase electric production it doesn't
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
reduce it it has nothing to do with
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and it's hidden it doesn't
 
04:48:36.830 --> 04:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
show up on the bill this is the perfect
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
example of bad government we're giving
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
subsidies to special interest groups and
 
04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
we're paying having somebody pay for it
 
04:48:45.070 --> 04:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
that don't even know they're paying for
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
it if people think such a great idea to
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
stimulate the wood products industry
 
04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
that we should have more wood being
 
04:48:53.548 --> 04:48:53.558 align:start position:0%
harvested and give them a subsidy then
 
04:48:55.390 --> 04:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
let's put it out in the open especially
 
04:48:56.910 --> 04:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
members of my party who are always
 
04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
standing up here saying I'm against this
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
tax that tax and all taxes and taxes
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
theft well this is a hidden tax this is
 
04:49:05.788 --> 04:49:05.798 align:start position:0%
one of the worst types you can have if
 
04:49:08.430 --> 04:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
you want to tax uh something to give a
 
04:49:11.230 --> 04:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
subsidy to Wood manufacturers or
 
04:49:13.070 --> 04:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
furnaces that burn wood then come out in
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
the open and pass a tax this is
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
government at its worst it has nothing
 
04:49:20.110 --> 04:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
to do with electric production it's just
 
04:49:22.350 --> 04:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
good lobbyists and they've got this in
 
04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
there and your electric rate payers who
 
04:49:25.868 --> 04:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
are always complaining about the rates
 
04:49:27.470 --> 04:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
are paying higher rates that they don't
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
even know to subsidize some large
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
furnace someplace some companies so they
 
04:49:34.510 --> 04:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
can make more profits by burning would
 
04:49:38.230 --> 04:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to push the red
 
04:49:44.190 --> 04:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%

colleague from the member from
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
straford did not say anything that was
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
wrong what he negle neglected to mention
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
was the significant County Municipal and
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
School District taxpayer savings that
 
04:50:13.070 --> 04:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
result from the renewable energy credits
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%

04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%

buildings that
 
04:51:12.548 --> 04:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
generate these thermal wrecks and reduce
 
04:51:15.030 --> 04:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
the cost that rate that taxpayers have
 
04:51:19.230 --> 04:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
facilities now in addition to
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
that encouraging wood burning supports
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
our forest products industry and as
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
you'll all recall in 2023 that industry
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
took a big hit when the burg biop power
 
04:51:35.760 --> 04:51:37.270 align:start position:0%
took a big hit when the burg biop power
plant

04:51:37.270 --> 04:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
plant
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
was significantly impacted by The veto
 
04:51:45.548 --> 04:51:45.558 align:start position:0%
of a bill that the house
 
04:51:49.230 --> 04:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
passed and the Senate passed it for that
 
04:51:52.590 --> 04:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
matter and the governor's veto was
 
04:51:55.548 --> 04:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
upheld so our committee decided that
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
rather than add insult to injury to the
 
04:51:57.680 --> 04:51:58.830 align:start position:0%
rather than add insult to injury to the
forest

04:51:58.830 --> 04:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
forest
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
industry that it would be prudent to
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
allow this bill to
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh be judged to be itl so that taxpayers
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
could continue to enjoy
 
04:52:15.708 --> 04:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
the decrease in their costs that result
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
from the sale of these thermal bricks so
 
04:52:22.708 --> 04:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote green to support the
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%

know the rate payers in say straford
 
04:53:40.708 --> 04:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
County should not be high paying higher
 
04:53:42.510 --> 04:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
electric bills to subsidize the rate
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
payers in Rockingham County and if I
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
know that we all talk about transparency
 
04:53:49.230 --> 04:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
in government we don't want hidden fees

they're spending but I then vote for
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
transparent but I if I know about voting
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%

colleagues and happy New Year I rise in

opposition to the motion of inexpedient
 
04:58:50.910 --> 04:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
to legislate there is not a single
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
member of this body or the body on the
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall who does not want
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
to do something about the high cost of
 
04:59:00.510 --> 04:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
electricity in our state it is impacting
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
families and hampering our ability to
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
retain exist in businesses let alone
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
attract new ones we are all United on
 
04:59:10.390 --> 04:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
that where we differ is whether we are
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
willing to enact short-term temporary
 
04:59:15.390 --> 04:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
rate reductions or begin to encourage
 
04:59:17.830 --> 04:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
meaningful Investments that will result
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
in long-term sustainable rates for all
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
of us to those of you who may be
 
04:59:26.590 --> 04:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
inclined to vote in favor of the motion
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
of inexpedient to
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
legislate understand that this bill will
 
04:59:34.030 --> 04:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
not raise the cost of electricity
 
04:59:36.670 --> 04:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
on the other hand a vote to overturn the
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
motion of inexpedient to legislate will
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
give individual consumers an opportunity
 
04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
to save money in the short term and will
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
have a small and will be a small step
 
04:59:49.230 --> 04:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
towards enabling the smarter management
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
of electric use that saves energy and
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
benefits all of us the only thing hb631
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
does is direct our three regulated
 
05:00:03.150 --> 05:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
utilities eversource Unitil and Liberty
 
05:00:06.190 --> 05:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
utilities to inform their customers that
 
05:00:09.150 --> 05:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
they have the option to purchase a smart
 
05:00:12.670 --> 05:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway device it is then up to
 
05:00:15.548 --> 05:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
each individual consumer to decide
 
05:00:17.070 --> 05:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
whether they want to install one of
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
those devices their choice no
 
05:00:23.868 --> 05:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
mandate smart meter gateways are devices
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
installed inside a home or business and
 
05:00:28.830 --> 05:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
are controlled by the home or business
 
05:00:31.548 --> 05:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
owner they help to monitor electricity
 
05:00:33.788 --> 05:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
consumption allowing the the household
 
05:00:36.270 --> 05:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
or business the opportunity to more
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
effectively manage their energy usage
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
and hopefully reduce their energy costs
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
hb631 does not mandate that New
 
05:00:47.548 --> 05:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire utilities purchase an
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
inventory of devices the only thing
 
05:00:53.070 --> 05:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
those utilities are required to do is
 
05:00:55.868 --> 05:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
inform their customers which devices are
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with best practices and
 
05:01:01.230 --> 05:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
supportive of features needed to run a
 
05:01:03.670 --> 05:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
21st century grid
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
the cost to install a smart meter
 
05:01:07.310 --> 05:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
Gateway device will be borne by the
 
05:01:10.590 --> 05:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
consumer who chooses to purchase it
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
there is no cost shifting to any other
 
05:01:16.830 --> 05:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
rate payer and there is no requirement
 
05:01:18.990 --> 05:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
that those devices must be installed by
 
05:01:22.670 --> 05:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
the utility HB 631 specifically says
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
that work can be done by approved
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
contractors the suggestion made in the
 
05:01:30.190 --> 05:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
house record that installing a smart
 
05:01:32.830 --> 05:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway device is like buying a
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
computer with no software support is
 
05:01:37.948 --> 05:01:37.958 align:start position:0%
misleading the software to measure and
 
05:01:39.788 --> 05:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
record electricity consumption is
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
installed in these devices consumers can
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
save money by reducing their energy
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
consumption and shifting their usage to
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
off- Peak periods those savings ACR to
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
customers whether or not the device is
 
05:01:54.150 --> 05:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
connected to the utility that provides
 
05:01:57.390 --> 05:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
the power to that household or business
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is encourage the
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
adoption of modern meters so that anyone
 
05:02:04.150 --> 05:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
who is interested and saving money can
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
do so most of these devices are also
 
05:02:10.110 --> 05:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
able through the internet to connect to
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
utility companies or energy power
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
vendors to manage power consumption with
 
05:02:17.628 --> 05:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
the right incentives and or rewards in
 
05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
place there are significant additional
 
05:02:22.548 --> 05:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
benefits available to utilities from
 
05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
operational efficiency greater
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
reliability and customer service gain by
 
05:02:29.548 --> 05:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
managing Peak demand and reducing losses
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
and outages how we achieve those
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
benefits is is quite frankly a
 
05:02:36.430 --> 05:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
discussion for another day and really
 
05:02:39.390 --> 05:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
not part of this bill there is nothing
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill that requires any of our
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
utilities to connect to or support any
 
05:02:47.310 --> 05:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
device their customer chooses to
 
05:02:49.750 --> 05:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
purchase the only requirement is that
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
eversource Unitil and Liberty Utilities
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
let their customers know what type of
 
05:02:57.070 --> 05:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
meter they can buy if they're interested
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
in doing so hb631 was submitted with the
 
05:03:02.868 --> 05:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge that smarter meters are
 
05:03:05.230 --> 05:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
already standard in some states and we
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
should be encouraging people to learn
 
05:03:08.230 --> 05:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
what is available if they want to
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
actively manage their own electric bills
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
we are at a critical juncture in how we
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
address the energy challenges we Face
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
consumers are looking for ways to reduce
 
05:03:21.948 --> 05:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
their energy costs installing gate smart
 
05:03:24.548 --> 05:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway devices will give those
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
who decide to purchase one the
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so we also need to
 
05:03:32.430 --> 05:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
more aggressively upgrade our power grid
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
more more advanced state-of-the-art
 
05:03:36.150 --> 05:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
meters are not the only thing we need to
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
do but they are as small albeit
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
important part of the solution by
 
05:03:43.788 --> 05:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
encouraging our utilities to identify
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
Dei devices that would be most
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
compatible with their plans for future
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
system upgrades now hb631 will help to
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
minimize future redundancy and future
 
05:03:58.150 --> 05:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
investment costs please join me in
 
05:04:00.390 --> 05:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
voting no on the motion of inexpedient
 
05:04:03.150 --> 05:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
to legislate so that another motion
 
05:04:05.868 --> 05:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
may be made thank you Mr Speaker and I
 
05:04:08.788 --> 05:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
request a roll call
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:04:19.680 --> 05:04:22.150 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr
Speaker

05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
well my good friend from
 
05:04:27.548 --> 05:04:27.558 align:start position:0%
Hampton has a good
 
05:04:30.070 --> 05:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
argument but it reminds me of a movie I
 
05:04:32.230 --> 05:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
saw from my cousin Vinnie when the when
 
05:04:34.510 --> 05:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
they the the pro was asked does it hold
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
not what the prime reason the prime
 
05:04:43.708 --> 05:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
problem is with this bill is that the
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill refers to smart meter Gateway
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
devices smart meter Gateway devices are
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
not smart
 
05:04:55.868 --> 05:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
meters Smart Meters come with software
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
and support to make them run and operate
 
05:05:00.830 --> 05:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
and they're available now through
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
programs offered by source and other
 
05:05:03.840 --> 05:05:06.230 align:start position:0%
programs offered by source and other
utilities

05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
smart Gateway devices are components
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
that will fit into electric meters or
 
05:05:15.948 --> 05:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
other devices uh to make them operate
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
and these are not supported by software
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
or programs uh they are not offered for
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
support by by the electric utilities so
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
this bill has very good intentions but
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's two things about it is it
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
necessary and does and is it practical
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the answer is it it does Nei it is
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
not necessary and it's not practical and
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
why besides RSA 374 Su colon 62 that
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
does uh require utilities to inform
 
05:05:50.590 --> 05:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
customers if they are going to inst
 
05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
install a smart meter uh this bill would
 
05:05:58.030 --> 05:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
require utilities to provide a smart
 
05:06:00.788 --> 05:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway device upon
 
05:06:02.970 --> 05:06:02.980 align:start position:0%
request um
 
05:06:02.980 --> 05:06:04.030 align:start position:0%
request um
[Music]

05:06:04.030 --> 05:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:06:06.750 --> 05:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
so stop being supported by your software
 
05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
so so the the the analogy of of
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
something like a computer without
 
05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
operating system is sort of uh correct
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
in that you can you can get you can get
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
a device you can have it installed in
 
05:06:20.548 --> 05:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
your meter but there is no support
 
05:06:23.310 --> 05:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
behind it there is no design behind it
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
and the and the utilities do not offer
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
that uh that support so you're you have
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
something installed that is relatively
 
05:06:34.830 --> 05:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
useless uh um thirdly uh secondly it's
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
not required because not necessary
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
because utilities already offer energy
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
survey uh energy saving programs like
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
smart meters like smart thermostats that
 
05:06:47.910 --> 05:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
you can get and they and you can enroll
 
05:06:49.750 --> 05:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
in their program and you can begin
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
saving uh money on energy immediately so
 
05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
these programs already exist which and
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
and the technology that runs these
 
05:07:00.868 --> 05:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
programs is preferred over the smart
 
05:07:03.390 --> 05:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway devices so that's another
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill is not
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
necessary and again from a practical
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
point of view um I as I I mentioned
 
05:07:13.548 --> 05:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
before there the smart meter gway
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
devices are not supportable so you're
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
buying something that unless someone
 
05:07:20.190 --> 05:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
designs or a third party designs
 
05:07:22.548 --> 05:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
additional software at some expense
 
05:07:23.708 --> 05:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
they're not going to work and the
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
utilities don't provide that that
 
05:07:29.948 --> 05:07:29.958 align:start position:0%
support so you know this bill
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned but it it just doesn't
 
05:07:36.190 --> 05:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't hold water so the the committee
 
05:07:38.270 --> 05:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
heard testimony to this effect and
 
05:07:43.628 --> 05:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
agreed 11 to9 that really do we need an
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
unnecessary bill that is not practical
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
in order to show people that we are
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do something to lower costs I
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a way to show people
 
05:07:54.868 --> 05:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
we're lowering costs this bill does not
 
05:07:57.030 --> 05:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
do that and therefore I strongly
 
05:07:58.830 --> 05:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
recommend you support the committee's
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that we
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
were that we are all concerned about the
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
high cost of electricity in New
 
05:09:55.990 --> 05:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if I know that this bill
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
will have no negative impact on
 
05:10:01.470 --> 05:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
electrical rates but instead it will
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
Direct are three regulated utilities to
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
inform their customers of the option to
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
purchase a smart meter Gateway device
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
which is a tool for monitoring usage
 
05:10:18.750 --> 05:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the day and finally if I also
 
05:10:21.788 --> 05:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
know that by using these meters and
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
looking at the results consumers can
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
save money by reducing their energy
 
05:10:30.670 --> 05:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
consumption and shifting their usage to
 
05:10:33.150 --> 05:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
off peak periods
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
would I now save our rapers and
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves a boatload of money by

Speaker if I know requiring a utility to
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
sell a smart meter Gateway
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%

of the floor amendment to House Bill
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
229 Mr Speaker in order to fully
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
comprehend this amendment it is
 
05:14:49.390 --> 05:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
important to understand three key
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
Concepts first by definition the
 
05:14:56.948 --> 05:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
National Guard is not a state militia
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
state militias are distinct from the
 
05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
National Guard and that they serve no
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
federal function the state of New
 
05:15:07.910 --> 05:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have a state
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
militia second the National Guard
 
05:15:14.110 --> 05:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
normally under State Control becomes
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
part of the Federal Reserve components
 
05:15:18.910 --> 05:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
of the United States Army and the United
 
05:15:21.948 --> 05:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
States Air Force when activated for
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
federal missions and third the National
 
05:15:28.628 --> 05:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
Guard operates under three different
 
05:15:31.628 --> 05:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
statuses title 10 status which is
 
05:15:33.628 --> 05:15:33.638 align:start position:0%
federally funded and federally
 
05:15:36.030 --> 05:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
controlled under the command and control
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the president title 32 status which
 
05:15:43.470 --> 05:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
is federally funded and state controlled
 
05:15:45.390 --> 05:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
under the command and control of the
 
05:15:49.150 --> 05:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
state or territory governor and state
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
Act of Duty which is state funded and
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
state controlled under the command and
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
control of the state territory or
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
Governor therefore the National Guard is
 
05:16:04.270 --> 05:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
under the Dual control of the state and
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
the federal governments now this
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
amendment clarifies the definition of
 
05:16:15.548 --> 05:16:15.558 align:start position:0%
active duty combat to include direct
 
05:16:20.110 --> 05:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
combat service in an armed conflict or
 
05:16:24.030 --> 05:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
combat service support employing an
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of war in support of an
 
05:16:31.628 --> 05:16:31.638 align:start position:0%
armed conflict both being hazardous du
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
duties to be clear this definition
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
includes Frontline service members as
 
05:16:41.470 --> 05:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
well as service members supporting the
 
05:16:46.590 --> 05:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
front lines both deployed under title 10
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
furthermore this amendment removes the
 
05:16:52.270 --> 05:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
Clause performance of a Duty through an
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of War as a standalone
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
provision from the definition of active
 
05:16:58.878 --> 05:17:00.110 align:start position:0%
provision from the definition of active
duty

05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
duty
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
combat where an instrumentality of war
 
05:17:07.990 --> 05:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
is defined as a vehicle vessel device or
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
equipment designated primarily for
 
05:17:11.200 --> 05:17:12.788 align:start position:0%
equipment designated primarily for
military

05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
military
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
service this change is important since
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
most missions performed by the National
 
05:17:22.948 --> 05:17:22.958 align:start position:0%
Guard are distinct from active duty
 
05:17:27.230 --> 05:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
combat and they involve the use of
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
instrumentalities of War duties that
 
05:17:30.718 --> 05:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
instrumentalities of War duties that
involve

05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
involve
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
the use of an instrumentality of War
 
05:17:37.628 --> 05:17:37.638 align:start position:0%
include most National Guard weekend
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
drills deployments training exercises
 
05:17:45.948 --> 05:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
Statewide State Side emergency responses
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
as well as humanitarian and Civic
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
assistance such duties also include
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
deployments to to provide training and
 
05:17:58.390 --> 05:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
assistant to Friendly foreign military
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
units through the National Guard State
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
partnership program to be clear none of
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
these missions of the National Guard
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
constitute active duty combat but they
 
05:18:12.390 --> 05:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
do involve the use of instrumentalities
 
05:18:15.070 --> 05:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
of war and these important missions
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited by the bill without
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment lastly sections five and
 
05:18:24.270 --> 05:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
six of the amendment are
 
05:18:26.430 --> 05:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
self-evident and that they simply
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that these non-active Duty
 
05:18:32.190 --> 05:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
combat missions are allowed with this
 
05:18:35.830 --> 05:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr Speaker in closing this
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%

Airborne Division as a combat medic
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
where I was honored with the combat
 
05:19:37.230 --> 05:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
medic badge for treating casualties
 
05:19:39.390 --> 05:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
Under Fire shapes my understanding of
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
the gravity of sending our troops into
 
05:19:43.628 --> 05:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
combat this bill requires the US
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
Congress to formally declare war before
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
deployment of New Hampshire National
 
05:19:49.110 --> 05:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
Guard troops into
 
05:19:51.270 --> 05:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
combat the United States Constitution
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
gives Congress the power to declare war
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
in part to ensure that grave decisions
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
were subject to rigorous debate
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative consent and transparency
 
05:20:02.270 --> 05:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
this process was designed to prevent
 
05:20:04.350 --> 05:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
unchecked executive power and to
 
05:20:06.350 --> 05:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the will of the people
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
through their elective Representatives
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
Was Heard and heeded by sidest stepping
 
05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
this process Congress is not held
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
accountable for the outcomes and
 
05:20:16.110 --> 05:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
consequences of military
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
engagements defend the guard is not an
 
05:20:19.590 --> 05:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
impediment to our National Guard's
 
05:20:21.150 --> 05:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
capacity to defend our nation and
 
05:20:23.390 --> 05:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
respond to emergencies instead it
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
fortifies the Constitutional process
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
requiring a formal declaration of war by
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
Congress before our troops are sent into
 
05:20:31.708 --> 05:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
Cong combat this doesn't prevent
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
deployment it ensures that such a
 
05:20:35.708 --> 05:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
significant decision is made with a full
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
deliberation and Authority that only a
 
05:20:40.030 --> 05:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
congressionally approved uh declared war
 
05:20:40.040 --> 05:20:40.990 align:start position:0%
congressionally approved uh declared war
can

05:20:40.990 --> 05:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:20:43.230 --> 05:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
provide our national Guardsmen can be
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
called into service under two distinct
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
codes title 10 and title 32 of the US
 
05:20:50.590 --> 05:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
code title 10 places our Guardsmen under
 
05:20:52.030 --> 05:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
presidential command for National
 
05:20:54.230 --> 05:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
Defense while title 32 keeps them under
 
05:20:56.190 --> 05:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
State command primarily for domestic
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
emergencies this bill continues New
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's compliance with both the
 
05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
issue is that Congress has not formally
 
05:21:04.430 --> 05:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
declared war since World War II instead
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
the authorization for use of military
 
05:21:09.628 --> 05:21:09.638 align:start position:0%
force aumf of 2001 has been used as a
 
05:21:11.350 --> 05:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
blanket justification for military
 
05:21:14.548 --> 05:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
actions worldwide the aumf has led to
 
05:21:16.708 --> 05:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
endless engagements with no
 
05:21:18.868 --> 05:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
accountability or oversight from those
 
05:21:20.910 --> 05:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
who initiated it this is not only a
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
legal misstep but a moral failure and it
 
05:21:24.590 --> 05:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
puts our troops in global stability at
 
05:21:27.628 --> 05:21:27.638 align:start position:0%
risk without proper justification or end
 
05:21:30.110 --> 05:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
strategy concerns about losing Federal
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
funding due to due to non-compliance
 
05:21:34.708 --> 05:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
with title 10 and 32 are overstated as
 
05:21:37.390 --> 05:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
outlined in section 108 of title 32 the
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
president has discretion in this and
 
05:21:41.548 --> 05:21:41.558 align:start position:0%
also must provide a time frame for
 
05:21:43.830 --> 05:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
states to address any compliance issues
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
before Financial consequences moreover
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
the political reality is that it is
 
05:21:49.750 --> 05:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
improbable for the federal government to
 
05:21:51.788 --> 05:21:51.798 align:start position:0%
withdraw funding from the National Guard
 
05:21:54.270 --> 05:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
an institution that enjoys widespread
 
05:21:56.830 --> 05:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
public support no politician will ever
 
05:21:58.470 --> 05:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
Advocate to withhold funding to the
 
05:21:58.480 --> 05:21:59.390 align:start position:0%
Advocate to withhold funding to the
National

05:21:59.390 --> 05:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
National
 
05:22:01.708 --> 05:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
Guard the New Hampshire government role
 
05:22:03.868 --> 05:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
is not to hold water for the US Congress
 
05:22:05.230 --> 05:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
but to uphold the principles of the
 
05:22:06.750 --> 05:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and protect the interests
 
05:22:08.830 --> 05:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
and rights of its citizens allowing
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
Congress to bypass its Duty not only
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
undermines the Constitutional framework
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
but it also diminishes the voice and
 
05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
repes representation of our constituents
 
05:22:18.430 --> 05:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
in matters of
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
War defend the guard resonates deeply
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
with our citizens across political
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
divides I have found unanimous support
 
05:22:26.830 --> 05:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
for this bill this is a decision that
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
impacts the lives of our servicemen and
 
05:22:31.030 --> 05:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
women and the Constitutional integrity
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
of our nation before we ask New
 
05:22:34.910 --> 05:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guards men and women to go to
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
foreign lands to kill and be killed we
 
05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
should first ask Congress to do its job
 
05:22:41.548 --> 05:22:41.558 align:start position:0%
and make a formal declaration of war
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:57.390 --> 05:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
Shir thank you m thank you Mr Speaker um
 
05:23:00.990 --> 05:23:01.000 align:start position:0%

my friend from De and he is my friend uh
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
I Rise to oppose this
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh when the bill first came to our
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee I got a lot of calls from
 
05:23:12.548 --> 05:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire and a few from
 
05:23:14.708 --> 05:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire and the last thing
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
they'd say to me is uh and don't forget
 
05:23:18.788 --> 05:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
veterans support this
 
05:23:22.150 --> 05:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill and uh and let me say nobody hates
 
05:23:24.510 --> 05:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
War other than those that have lost a
 
05:23:26.350 --> 05:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
loved one more than a
 
05:23:29.350 --> 05:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
veteran and I haven't fought in a war a
 
05:23:32.910 --> 05:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
long time ago and Far Away along with my
 
05:23:34.030 --> 05:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
friend from
 
05:23:34.040 --> 05:23:35.868 align:start position:0%
friend from
havil

05:23:35.868 --> 05:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
havil
 
05:23:38.110 --> 05:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:23:41.230 --> 05:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
um the agonies of
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
War but I'm a veteran and I don't
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
support this
 
05:23:50.750 --> 05:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
bill and um and that feeling was
 
05:23:53.868 --> 05:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
reinforced when the state veterans
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
advisory Council met for those that
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
don't know and I know a lot of you do
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
know about the council it's a state
 
05:24:00.240 --> 05:24:02.070 align:start position:0%
know about the council it's a state
agency

05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
agency
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh is chaired by Paul Lloyd the past
 
05:24:06.750 --> 05:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
commander of the New Hampshire VFW and a
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
real friend of veterans and it's made up
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
of 20 different veterans organizations
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh uh VFW uh Korean war vets uh American
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
Legion Vietnam Veterans of
 
05:24:21.480 --> 05:24:23.350 align:start position:0%
Legion Vietnam Veterans of
America

05:24:23.350 --> 05:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
America
 
05:24:26.310 --> 05:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
um military order of the purple hat and
 
05:24:29.708 --> 05:24:29.718 align:start position:0%
so many others and that organization on
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
a vote of 2010 to nothing voted not to
 
05:24:35.948 --> 05:24:35.958 align:start position:0%
support this bill but to oppose
 
05:24:35.958 --> 05:24:38.030 align:start position:0%
support this bill but to oppose
it

05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:24:41.670 --> 05:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
now this is not a good bill it's not
 
05:24:44.110 --> 05:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
good for the National Guard it's not
 
05:24:47.070 --> 05:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
good for New Hampshire it's not good for
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
our country and for me most importantly
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's not good for members on active duty
 
05:24:55.628 --> 05:24:55.638 align:start position:0%
of the Armed Forces and I should mention
 
05:24:57.310 --> 05:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
we have a member from the legislature
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
that also serves on the state advisory
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
committee and doesn't excellent
 
05:25:04.510 --> 05:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
job it's not good for the National Guard
 
05:25:07.548 --> 05:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
because as I said in my blurb we get uh
 
05:25:10.470 --> 05:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
up to2 Billion a year from the
 
05:25:12.990 --> 05:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense a lot of that goes
 
05:25:16.110 --> 05:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
into planes for the Air National Guard
 
05:25:19.310 --> 05:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
goes into paying for personnel it goes
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
into buying the helicopters that we
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
often see on Channel 9 News bringing
 
05:25:24.990 --> 05:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
somebody down from the mountains who's
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
been injured it does so much for our
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:32.030 align:start position:0%
been injured it does so much for our
state

05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:25:33.470 --> 05:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
that could be a Jeopardy for our
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
National Guard now you someone may speak
 
05:25:37.390 --> 05:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
later and say oh no the Pentagon won't
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
take away that two billion they got
 
05:25:41.070 --> 05:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
plenty of money they'll keep giving it
 
05:25:43.750 --> 05:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire not if you get a
 
05:25:45.430 --> 05:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
National Guard that can't react
 
05:25:49.070 --> 05:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
immediately to uh a National Defense
 
05:25:52.548 --> 05:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
issue uh this bill as I mentioned is not
 
05:25:55.230 --> 05:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
good for New Hampshire because we do get
 
05:25:57.150 --> 05:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of services from our national
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
guard that stay right here in this state
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
and help so much whether it's Engineers
 
05:26:03.868 --> 05:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
or anything else a lot of that money
 
05:26:05.788 --> 05:26:05.798 align:start position:0%
that goes to support those programs will
 
05:26:09.868 --> 05:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
be gone it won't be good for our country
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
and it won't be good for our active duty
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
military the last time Congress passed
 
05:26:18.670 --> 05:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
the declaration of war was on December
 
05:26:18.680 --> 05:26:20.030 align:start position:0%
the declaration of war was on December
11th

05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
11th
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
1941 when our country declared war on
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
Germany 4 days after Pearl habo was
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
attacked and if we learn nothing else
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
from World War II we learned that this
 
05:26:36.990 --> 05:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
country is no longer a citadel we do not
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
stand alone and have the Atlantic in the
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
Pacific to protect us from our enemies
 
05:26:46.350 --> 05:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
abroad if something happens like in
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
1950 when North Korea came over the 48th
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
parallel and attacked South
 
05:26:54.830 --> 05:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
Korea we had to react immediately and we
 
05:26:58.110 --> 05:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
did along with the United
 
05:27:01.548 --> 05:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
Nations we now have a complete Nut Job
 
05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
running North Korea Kim Kim Yung on
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
who's got a missile that can hit the
 
05:27:09.990 --> 05:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
United States if he should again decide
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
to attack Korea we've got to act
 
05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
immediately when I served in Vietnam the
 
05:27:20.070 --> 05:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
17 field artillery was stationed there
 
05:27:22.150 --> 05:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
too of the National Guard and there only
 
05:27:24.190 --> 05:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of Miles where from where I was
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
at Li K with the first division second
 
05:27:29.628 --> 05:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
Brigade they fought with honor and they
 
05:27:32.470 --> 05:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
fought with sacri riced by that unit I
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
was proud to have them there and
 
05:27:37.830 --> 05:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
partners even more so today when our
 
05:27:40.510 --> 05:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
national gu is part of that tapestry of
 
05:27:43.590 --> 05:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
United States defense all the agencies
 
05:27:45.548 --> 05:27:45.558 align:start position:0%
and all the Departments weave together
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
as one solid force in defense of our
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
nation we got some more bills and we've
 
05:27:53.190 --> 05:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
been here a long time already I'm going
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
to end now but I please ask you to vote
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
no on this so another motion can be made
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:08.830 --> 05:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
05:28:11.670 --> 05:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
support of HB 229 commonly referred to
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
as the defend the guard act this bill
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
very simply requires Congress to
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
formally declare war pursuant to Article
 
05:28:21.150 --> 05:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
1 Section 8 of the US Constitution
 
05:28:23.310 --> 05:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
before we will deploy our State National
 
05:28:26.670 --> 05:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
Guard to a foreign combat zone it does
 
05:28:29.270 --> 05:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
not stop training deployments natural

attached to this bill a vague puts

funding at risk is the same tired Hollow
 
05:28:48.548 --> 05:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
threat the feds used bully States into
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
compliance it's intentionally
 
05:28:53.788 --> 05:28:53.798 align:start position:0%
non-committal because it's nonsense when
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%

reported accurately as having no fiscal

impact Congress congressman goser and
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
Massie have spoken in favor of this bill
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
reminding us that Congress controls the
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
purse strings and no member would
 
05:29:11.788 --> 05:29:11.798 align:start position:0%
consider defunding a guard unit it
 
05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
simply would be political suicide to
 
05:29:15.628 --> 05:29:15.638 align:start position:0%
file an amendment to an Appropriations
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
Bill defunding a single state guard
 
05:29:21.150 --> 05:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
being both a petty Act of malice and
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
also making the country weaker it will
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
not happen now for a bit of History
 
05:29:28.750 --> 05:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
Congress has not formally declared war
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
since 1942 42 the War Powers Resolution
 
05:29:32.160 --> 05:29:33.310 align:start position:0%

of
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
1973 uh introduced the authorizations
 
05:29:37.628 --> 05:29:37.638 align:start position:0%
for use of military force which have
 
05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
been the mechanism by which the
 
05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
presidents have executed military
 
05:29:44.750 --> 05:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
operations ever since this abdication of

constitutionally delegated power to the
 
05:29:48.990 --> 05:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch ultimately led us into
 
05:29:52.270 --> 05:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
forever Wars of the last two decades the
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
2001 aumf was hastily passed in the wake
 
05:29:58.110 --> 05:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
of 911 and was so vastly worded with
 
05:30:00.430 --> 05:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
vague limits on targets theaters of oper
 
05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
ation and no Victory conditions that has
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
been the justification for military
 
05:30:08.270 --> 05:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
action in 22 countries over the course
 
05:30:10.030 --> 05:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
of the war on terror National Guard
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%

hurricane Katrina's Devastation in 2005
 
05:30:24.270 --> 05:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
was exacerbated by Guard soldiers and
 
05:30:26.110 --> 05:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
equipment that were deployed to Iraq and
 
05:30:27.990 --> 05:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
Kuwait instead of at home protecting
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
their communities years later one of the
 
05:30:32.788 --> 05:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
same missing Louisiana National Guard
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%

under rocket attacks during their
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
deployment to Syria in 2021 where the US
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
is occupying that country's oil fields
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
the Pentagon will continue to exploit
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
State guard units to bolster their
 
05:30:49.708 --> 05:30:49.718 align:start position:0%
shrinking ranks in these forever Wars
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know the title 10 of the US
code

05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
code
 
05:34:02.390 --> 05:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
outlines the authority of the federal
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
government to activate the reserves
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
including the National Guard in time of
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
war or of a national emergency or when
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise authorized by law law and that
 
05:34:18.670 --> 05:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
a governor may not withhold consent in
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
whole or part with regards to active
 
05:34:24.910 --> 05:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
duty deployment outside of the United
 
05:34:28.548 --> 05:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
States and if I know that Congress in
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
2001 passed the authorization of the use
 
05:34:35.390 --> 05:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
of military force act which empowered
 
05:34:39.230 --> 05:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
the president to use all necessary and
 
05:34:43.270 --> 05:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate Force against Nations
 
05:34:46.590 --> 05:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and persons dealing in
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
Acts of international terrorism against
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
the United States and that the aumf ACT
 
05:34:58.150 --> 05:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
has been used to activate combat
 
05:35:01.270 --> 05:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
activities against ter terrorist groups
 
05:35:05.070 --> 05:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
abroad without a declaration of war for
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
the past 19 years and finally Mr
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker although I believe HB
 
05:35:17.430 --> 05:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
229 is well intended as we all want to
 
05:35:19.628 --> 05:35:19.638 align:start position:0%
keep our New Hampshire National
 
05:35:23.470 --> 05:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen out of Harm's Way but I also
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
know that the department of military
 
05:35:29.310 --> 05:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services opposed
 
05:35:31.708 --> 05:35:31.718 align:start position:0%
this bill Bill and that it would create
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
a conflict between the state and federal
 
05:35:38.910 --> 05:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
laws and the supremacy clause of the
 
05:35:40.948 --> 05:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
United States
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and can only be resolved at
 
05:35:45.470 --> 05:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
level would I now press the red
 
05:35:55.830 --> 05:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
button to uh uh against the otpa thank
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize representative Reed
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:07.230 --> 05:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:36:10.030 --> 05:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
know members of Congress have reaffirmed
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
that Congress certainly will not take
 
05:36:16.270 --> 05:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
the unprecedented move of defunding a
 
05:36:19.390 --> 05:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
state Guard unit and certainly not the
 
05:36:21.430 --> 05:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
committee chaired by one of New
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's own
 
05:36:25.350 --> 05:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
senators and certainly not for New
 
05:36:26.948 --> 05:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire affirming that it should be
 
05:36:30.670 --> 05:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
Congress and not one man one person who
 
05:36:34.150 --> 05:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
makes the dire Last Resort decision to
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
send the National Guard into overseas
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
war and if I know that we have spent
 
05:36:43.510 --> 05:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
over two decades thousands of lives and
 
05:36:46.030 --> 05:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
trillions of dollars to enrich oil
 
05:36:49.470 --> 05:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
companies and defense contractors while
 
05:36:51.310 --> 05:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
destabilizing the Middle East and
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
souring an entire generation against the
 
05:36:56.910 --> 05:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
United States and finally Mr Speaker if
 
05:37:00.270 --> 05:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
I know that as the name implies the
 
05:37:02.948 --> 05:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
place for the National Guard is here at
 
05:37:05.708 --> 05:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
home guarding the nation where they will
 
05:37:07.750 --> 05:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
be available to help us during the next
 
05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
pandemic or natural disaster or civil

and that was recognized at our public
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
hearing if I know that uh the major flaw
 
05:42:10.030 --> 05:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
actually would be harmful to the people
 
05:42:12.830 --> 05:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to benefit rather than
 
05:42:15.350 --> 05:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
help them and Mr Speaker if I also know
 
05:42:16.910 --> 05:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
that it's not the habit of this house to
 
05:42:19.390 --> 05:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
send bills with major flaws to the other
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker colleagues if I
 
05:42:40.230 --> 05:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
know that as you consider the question
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
of tabling this bill several relevant
 
05:42:46.510 --> 05:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
points might be considered and should be
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
considered and furthermore I know that
 
05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee retained
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
this bill last year because of the sense
 
05:42:55.750 --> 05:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
that there was a problem and that we
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
should work on a
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
solution and finally if I know that this
 
05:43:02.670 --> 05:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
bill might have come to the floor on a
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%

competitors now that's just not my
 
05:51:40.590 --> 05:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
opinion the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:51:45.190 --> 05:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
wrote in a 1999 decision that and I
 
05:51:48.110 --> 05:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
quote The Waters Edge provision was
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
adopted for the benefit of foreign
 
05:51:55.270 --> 05:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
businesses in a deal with then British
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
prime minister Maggie Thatcher the US
 
05:52:00.670 --> 05:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
and foreign governments essentially
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
threatened the states into adopting
 
05:52:07.030 --> 05:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge provision since
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
1986 when New Hampshire adopted Waters
 
05:52:13.990 --> 05:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
Edge domestic businesses have operated
 
05:52:15.510 --> 05:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
under an
 
05:52:18.548 --> 05:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive and unequal tax burden
 
05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
compared to foreign
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
Enterprises even before the US
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
government began pushing states to adopt
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge in the mid1
 
05:52:32.350 --> 05:52:32.360 align:start position:0%
1980s then treasury secretary James
 
05:52:35.948 --> 05:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
Baker wrote that I quote if a foreign
 
05:52:39.628 --> 05:52:39.638 align:start position:0%
Only Solution were adopted it could
 
05:52:42.910 --> 05:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
reasonably be argued that domestically
 
05:52:47.270 --> 05:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
controlled businesses were thereby
 
05:52:50.310 --> 05:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged prior to 1986 New
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire operated under what is known
 
05:52:55.708 --> 05:52:55.718 align:start position:0%
as worldwide combined
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
reporting it was supposed to require all
 
05:53:02.990 --> 05:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
companies domestic and foreign to
 
05:53:03.000 --> 05:53:04.548 align:start position:0%

transparently report all activities
 
05:53:10.910 --> 05:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
worldwide so that an accurate tax
 
05:53:13.390 --> 05:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
liability for activities in New
 
05:53:15.430 --> 05:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could be
 
05:53:18.468 --> 05:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
determined but for some reason the New
 
05:53:20.270 --> 05:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
05:53:22.708 --> 05:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
Administration in the early
 
05:53:26.390 --> 05:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
1980s chose not to enforce the law

against foreign companies

on this issue to the Ways and Means
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
Committee that the dr's policy was
 
05:53:46.110 --> 05:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and probably
 
05:53:48.990 --> 05:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional never mind that it
 
05:53:52.948 --> 05:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
ignored state law but in adopting Waters
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
Edge we simply codified that
 
05:54:01.468 --> 05:54:01.478 align:start position:0%
discrimination House Bill 121 will write
 
05:54:04.110 --> 05:54:04.120 align:start position:0%

Waters Edge and enacting worldwide
 
05:54:18.390 --> 05:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
combined reporting could increase state

revenue by
 
05:54:24.990 --> 05:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
$177 million annually with no impact on

New Hampshire businesses or taxpayers
 
05:54:30.788 --> 05:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
with the pressures facing property
 
05:54:33.708 --> 05:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and public schools why
 
05:54:37.708 --> 05:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we end this anti- competitive
 
05:54:42.190 --> 05:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
practice but by a narrow 10 to9 margin
 
05:54:44.510 --> 05:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee recommends that

legislate they want you to vote to
 
05:54:56.670 --> 05:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
continue protecting foreign companies
 
05:55:00.030 --> 05:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
from taxation at the expense of New
 
05:55:02.830 --> 05:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses you're probably
 
05:55:06.430 --> 05:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
asking why vote to change a tax policy
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
called Waters Edge tax method that from
 
05:55:13.548 --> 05:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
1986 is the largest single generator of
 
05:55:16.468 --> 05:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
state tax revenue through the business
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
profits tax each year the most important
 
05:55:24.070 --> 05:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
value we all strive for in our
 
05:55:27.030 --> 05:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislature is equal treatment under the
 
05:55:29.230 --> 05:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
law for our
 
05:55:33.070 --> 05:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
citizens equal treatment is not just the
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
overriding principle of Taxation policy
 
05:55:37.708 --> 05:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
in ways and
 
05:55:40.990 --> 05:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
means it is The Guiding Light of the
 
05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
rule of law in a
 
05:55:47.990 --> 05:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
democracy present domestic companies and
 
05:55:51.070 --> 05:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
businesses in the granite state must
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
fully document sales activities and pay
 
05:55:58.270 --> 05:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
their full tax liability Under The
 
05:56:01.868 --> 05:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge policy while the same tax
 
05:56:05.548 --> 05:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
policy permits foreign Enterprises to
 
05:56:07.150 --> 05:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
escape such
 
05:56:10.628 --> 05:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
documentation and full tax liability
 
05:56:12.948 --> 05:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
which is clearly
 
05:56:16.350 --> 05:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive and obviously
 
05:56:19.590 --> 05:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory it is now a moral and
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
legal decision that each of us must make
 
05:56:26.350 --> 05:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
on this itl
 
05:56:29.150 --> 05:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation but one fully in keeping
 
05:56:33.390 --> 05:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
with our belief in free and Fair
 
05:56:36.270 --> 05:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
competition I also know a vote for the
 
05:56:39.708 --> 05:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
itl motion today which is a vote to
 
05:56:42.910 --> 05:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
punish New Hampshire businesses to
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
protect foreign ones is a vote that will
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
be remembered come
 
05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
November we need to promote our value
 
05:56:55.670 --> 05:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
system of equal treatment under our New

05:57:56.878 --> 05:57:58.868 align:start position:0%

delicious

05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
delicious

the next day after another long day in
 
05:58:04.270 --> 05:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
the State House you've earned another
 
05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%

you get to your car so you stop by that
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
new Starbucks in the Market Basket

parking lot you get another mocha latte
 
05:58:19.910 --> 05:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
and it's another six bucks but it's also
 
05:58:22.628 --> 05:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
delicious now to be clear you actually
 
05:58:22.638 --> 05:58:23.590 align:start position:0%
delicious now to be clear you actually
pay

05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
pay
 
05:58:27.230 --> 05:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
$651 for each $6 mocha because you pay
 
05:58:31.230 --> 05:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
an8 .5% room in meals tax which goes
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
straight to the state coffers that tax
 
05:58:34.320 --> 05:58:35.868 align:start position:0%
straight to the state coffers that tax
is

05:58:35.868 --> 05:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:58:38.910 --> 05:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
transparent right there on the receipt
 
05:58:40.990 --> 05:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
and it's the same whether you pay it at
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
Rebel Stoke or at
 
05:58:45.070 --> 05:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
Starbucks but what about business
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
profits tax the BPT do Revelstoke and
 
05:58:51.190 --> 05:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
Starbucks pay the same business profit
 
05:58:55.468 --> 05:58:55.478 align:start position:0%
tax on that $6 latte they should right
 
05:58:57.310 --> 05:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
assuming for the sake of argument that
 
05:59:00.510 --> 05:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
they labor lease paper and other costs
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
are the same we would assume that when
 
05:59:04.350 --> 05:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
these two companies pay their New
 
05:59:07.230 --> 05:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire BPT they would pay the same
 
05:59:11.150 --> 05:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
amount right it would only be fair but
 
05:59:13.788 --> 05:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
that's not what happens because while
 
05:59:16.230 --> 05:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
Revel Stoke sends the taxes on their
 
05:59:18.948 --> 05:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
profits across the street the profits
 
05:59:21.830 --> 05:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
from that Starbucks 500 yards away
 
05:59:24.628 --> 05:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
travel halfway across the globe before
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
any taxes on them make it to conquered
 
05:59:30.350 --> 05:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not just talking about a trip to
 
05:59:33.628 --> 05:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
Starbucks HQ in Seattle I'm talking
 
05:59:36.110 --> 05:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
about an accounting junket to tax Havens
 
05:59:39.150 --> 05:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
like Ireland Switzerland and the
 
05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
Netherlands while Revel Stoke declares
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
$2 of profit when they make $2 on a
 
05:59:47.990 --> 05:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
latte Starbucks doesn't do that they pay
 
05:59:50.310 --> 05:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
a shell company in the Netherlands for
 
05:59:52.830 --> 05:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
the intellectual property rights to use
 
05:59:55.948 --> 05:59:55.958 align:start position:0%
the Starbucks logo and name because
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's where intellectual property taxes
 
05:59:58.160 --> 05:59:59.150 align:start position:0%
that's where intellectual property taxes
are

05:59:59.150 --> 05:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:00:02.548 --> 06:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
lowest tax Havens around the world cater
 
06:00:05.468 --> 06:00:05.478 align:start position:0%
to these multinationals charging them
 
06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
extremely low taxes on Specialized
 
06:00:11.468 --> 06:00:11.478 align:start position:0%
Financial transactions to transfer
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
profits to themselves enabling them to
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
avoid taxes due to the places they
 
06:00:20.670 --> 06:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
actually make their money so by the time
 
06:00:22.910 --> 06:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
they're done transferring profits around
 
06:00:26.390 --> 06:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
the world to wherever the the tax policy
 
06:00:28.670 --> 06:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
costs them the least
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
multinationals like Starbucks can
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
actually declare a loss on that mocha
 
06:00:37.190 --> 06:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
sold here in conquered and thus avoid
 
06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
paying any tax due on that
 
06:00:43.670 --> 06:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
profit this means that Revel Stoke and
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
its one store here in coner is
 
06:00:48.910 --> 06:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
shouldering the load for multinationals
 
06:00:52.110 --> 06:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
like Starbucks with its 29 stores across
 
06:00:55.590 --> 06:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
the state and if Revel Stoke is paying
 
06:00:58.948 --> 06:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
15 cents on every single latte in New
 
06:01:01.590 --> 06:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Starbucks is shielding
 
06:01:04.350 --> 06:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
their profit from that tax then
 
06:01:08.030 --> 06:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
Starbucks is really making 15 cents more
 
06:01:10.910 --> 06:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
per latte even when they're charging the
 
06:01:14.310 --> 06:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
same price and have the same
 
06:01:18.030 --> 06:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
costs that's 15 cents per latte that
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
Starbucks can use to outcompete Revel
 
06:01:23.948 --> 06:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
Stoke having a hard time hiring
 
06:01:28.830 --> 06:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
Starbucks can outp Revel stoke
 
06:01:31.548 --> 06:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
economy getting tight Starbucks can
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
lower their
 
06:01:35.390 --> 06:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
prices getting the vibe that people
 
06:01:38.350 --> 06:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
really want to buy local Starbucks could
 
06:01:41.110 --> 06:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
launch a marketing campaign saying how
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
good they are for the local
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
economy while sending their profits to
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%

for ourselves stop letting these

06:06:13.110 --> 06:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
down and anchor it in the

practicality of having workable tax

06:06:31.590 --> 06:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
heard the federal government began
 
06:06:35.430 --> 06:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
taxing business income in the early
 
06:06:40.430 --> 06:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
1930s they require reporting of income
 
06:06:42.628 --> 06:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
generated in the United
 
06:06:45.628 --> 06:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
States they deal with
 
06:06:48.670 --> 06:06:48.680 align:start position:0%

intra corporate transfer
 
06:06:54.270 --> 06:06:54.280 align:start position:0%

06:06:57.788 --> 06:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
reflect arms length pricing
 
06:07:00.310 --> 06:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
so that it
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
dissuades and through audit perhaps
 
06:07:08.030 --> 06:07:08.040 align:start position:0%

what the IRS has used

trend by the early 1980s New Hampshire
 
06:07:46.230 --> 06:07:46.240 align:start position:0%

06:09:35.948 --> 06:09:35.958 align:start position:0%
twice was that states were

06:09:40.190 --> 06:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
combined
 
06:09:42.750 --> 06:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
reporting now just imagine what the
 
06:09:45.590 --> 06:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
burden on a multinational corporation
 
06:09:47.628 --> 06:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
would be under worldwide combined
 
06:09:50.990 --> 06:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
reporting and by the way it does not
 
06:09:52.510 --> 06:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
make a difference whether it's a
 
06:09:55.030 --> 06:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
us-based corporation doing business
 
06:09:58.070 --> 06:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
overseas or a foreign based Corporation
 
06:09:59.990 --> 06:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
doing business
 
06:10:02.350 --> 06:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
here and the suggestion that they're
 
06:10:05.110 --> 06:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
treated differently under current law is
 
06:10:08.190 --> 06:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:10.990 --> 06:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
wrong as long as you sell something in
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but you also sell
 
06:10:16.030 --> 06:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
something somewhere elsewhere outside
 
06:10:20.350 --> 06:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
the United States you would be drawn in
 
06:10:23.548 --> 06:10:23.558 align:start position:0%
to these extraordinarily cumbersome
 
06:10:23.558 --> 06:10:25.628 align:start position:0%
to these extraordinarily cumbersome
reporting

06:10:25.628 --> 06:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
06:10:25.638 --> 06:10:28.190 align:start position:0%

obligations

06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
06:10:30.270 --> 06:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
so it's for those kinds of reasons that
 
06:10:30.280 --> 06:10:31.230 align:start position:0%
so it's for those kinds of reasons that
in

06:10:31.230 --> 06:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:10:33.708 --> 06:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
1986 the New Hampshire
 
06:10:36.350 --> 06:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
legislature repealed worldwide combined
 
06:10:39.910 --> 06:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
reporting and imposed waterers Edge
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
limitations and that's now been the law
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
for 38
 
06:10:48.590 --> 06:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
years what The Waters Edge limitation
 
06:10:52.150 --> 06:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
does is it allows for us to ask unitary
 
06:10:54.110 --> 06:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
businesses operating amongst the States
 
06:10:55.990 --> 06:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
to declare all of their activity in the
 
06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
United States but that's actually an
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
enormous convenience because it aligns
 
06:11:03.868 --> 06:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
our reporting requirements with those of
 
06:11:06.110 --> 06:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue
 
06:11:08.990 --> 06:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
Service so when a
 
06:11:12.590 --> 06:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
business us-based or foreign-based
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
files its tax return with the IRS that's
 
06:11:21.548 --> 06:11:21.558 align:start position:0%
the point of departure for now preparing
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire business profits
 
06:11:27.150 --> 06:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
tax so why
 
06:11:30.910 --> 06:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
after 38 years are we supposed to be
 
06:11:33.708 --> 06:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
motivated to go back to something that
 
06:11:35.548 --> 06:11:35.558 align:start position:0%
every state
 
06:11:38.548 --> 06:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
abandoned there is no
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
state that applies worldwide combined
 
06:11:44.190 --> 06:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
reporting and if New Hampshire were to
 
06:11:46.590 --> 06:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
adopt HB
 
06:11:50.430 --> 06:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
1221 we would be reaching far beyond
 
06:11:53.948 --> 06:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
what the Internal Revenue Service asks
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
for it's actually
 
06:12:00.670 --> 06:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to even explain how
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
complicated that could get but I can
 
06:12:03.868 --> 06:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
tell you that I used to work for a
 
06:12:05.948 --> 06:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
multinational Shipping Company operating
 
06:12:10.750 --> 06:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
in 78 countries and uh my personal tax
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
return because I lived in the
 
06:12:13.468 --> 06:12:13.478 align:start position:0%
Netherlands for a couple of years was
 
06:12:16.590 --> 06:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
about that big so you can only
 
06:12:20.468 --> 06:12:20.478 align:start position:0%
imagine you've been told that hb21 is
 
06:12:23.350 --> 06:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
simple the only thing simple about it is
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
the statement of its
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
intent there is nothing simple about it
 
06:12:31.708 --> 06:12:31.718 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of
 
06:12:34.510 --> 06:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
implementation from the standpoint of
 
06:12:36.830 --> 06:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
compliance from the standpoint of
 
06:12:39.390 --> 06:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring or audit or
 
06:12:41.948 --> 06:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement we're dealing with companies
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
that are
 
06:12:46.948 --> 06:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
operating in a host of countries whose
 
06:12:50.030 --> 06:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
legal systems are entirely different
 
06:12:53.910 --> 06:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
whose tax regimes are entirely
 
06:12:56.990 --> 06:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
different whose accounting
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
standards don't bear any relation to
 
06:13:04.948 --> 06:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
ours whose languages are different whose
 
06:13:06.430 --> 06:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
currencies are
 
06:13:10.110 --> 06:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
different do not be swept in with the
 
06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
idea that this is somehow an easy
 
06:13:16.190 --> 06:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
solution it may be
 
06:13:19.628 --> 06:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
true that transfer pricing can be used
 
06:13:22.030 --> 06:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
in abusive ways but there are
 
06:13:25.548 --> 06:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
initiatives on the international level
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
through the Oe ecd with our state
 
06:13:33.310 --> 06:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
department and they have made
 
06:13:35.948 --> 06:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
progress part of the progress was in the
 
06:13:38.910 --> 06:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
tax cuts and jobs act when the corporate
 
06:13:43.030 --> 06:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh tax rate was reduced from 36% to
 
06:13:45.830 --> 06:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
21% corporations now have far less
 
06:13:49.350 --> 06:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
incentive to shift profits
 
06:13:51.628 --> 06:13:51.638 align:start position:0%
overseas part of it has been dealt with
 
06:13:54.310 --> 06:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
through the guilty rules very Arcane I
 
06:13:58.030 --> 06:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
won't get into it but when you're told
 
06:14:00.670 --> 06:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
that we need to reinstate worldwide
 
06:14:03.788 --> 06:14:03.798 align:start position:0%
combined reporting to level the planing

having to declare their worldwide

operations so I could go on I'll just
 
06:14:48.360 --> 06:14:49.628 align:start position:0%
operations so I could go on I'll just
say

06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:14:53.190 --> 06:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
that if this was not complicated if this
 
06:14:53.200 --> 06:14:54.110 align:start position:0%
that if this was not complicated if this
was

06:14:54.110 --> 06:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:14:56.628 --> 06:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
simple the ways and means commit would
 
06:14:59.190 --> 06:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
not have punted it would not have gone
 
06:15:02.590 --> 06:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
to a statutory commission the statutory
 
06:15:03.910 --> 06:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
commission would not have written a
 
06:15:06.628 --> 06:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
16-page report with all kinds of
 
06:15:09.590 --> 06:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
appendices and a bibliography of dozens
 
06:15:11.390 --> 06:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
and dozens and dozens of scholarly
 
06:15:15.750 --> 06:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
articles court cases and and and
 
06:15:17.910 --> 06:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
essays the commission wouldn't have
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
voted six to one to kill this bill so be
 
06:15:25.200 --> 06:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
voted six to one to kill this bill so be
practical

06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
practical
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed I predict we will
 
06:15:34.590 --> 06:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
spend years digging ourselves out of a
 
06:15:36.590 --> 06:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
quagmire of
 
06:15:40.830 --> 06:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:43.990 --> 06:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you you may inquire
 
06:15:46.670 --> 06:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative PL thank you for taking
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
my question representative spillsbury if
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
we were to adopt worldwide reporting
 
06:15:52.990 --> 06:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
would it result in an increase in
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
revenues a decrease in revenues or a
 
06:15:55.120 --> 06:15:59.468 align:start position:0%
revenues a decrease in revenues or a
crapshoot

06:15:59.468 --> 06:15:59.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.110 --> 06:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
the correct answer is C crapshoot it
 
06:16:03.910 --> 06:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
would depend entirely on whether the
 
06:16:06.310 --> 06:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
prophets overseas were lower or greater
 
06:16:08.788 --> 06:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
which could vary by company and could
 
06:16:11.150 --> 06:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
vary for a company from year to year we
 
06:16:15.750 --> 06:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
know before we move on I want to take a
 
06:16:21.030 --> 06:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
moment I probably annoyed a couple of
 
06:16:23.270 --> 06:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
people by doing an experiment there was
 
06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
a complaint about noise and I did
 
06:16:27.708 --> 06:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
nothing I didn't react cuz I wanted to
 
06:16:30.750 --> 06:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
see well I wanted to learn and I did I
 
06:16:32.270 --> 06:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to learn if there was one
 
06:16:34.430 --> 06:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
particular group over the other I wanted
 
06:16:37.270 --> 06:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
to see if the level was proportional at
 
06:16:39.868 --> 06:16:39.878 align:start position:0%
all to the length of the speech here's
 
06:16:43.230 --> 06:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
what I found started out kind of quiet
 
06:16:45.270 --> 06:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
if you get like 5 minutes in not that it
 
06:16:47.910 --> 06:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
is an excuse but then it starts to get
 
06:16:51.030 --> 06:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
loud and I did notice that one side was
 
06:16:52.830 --> 06:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
noticeably quieter than the other I'm
 
06:16:55.150 --> 06:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
not going to name the culprits I just
 
06:16:56.948 --> 06:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
want to remind you all if if you were
 
06:16:59.110 --> 06:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
sitting there listening quietly and
 
06:17:02.110 --> 06:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully thank you and if you
 
06:17:05.230 --> 06:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
weren't you may be the one down here one
 
06:17:09.670 --> 06:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:12.350 --> 06:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
heard representative shamberg repress a

06:17:19.948 --> 06:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
seconded that is sufficiently seconded
 
06:17:21.788 --> 06:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%

06:18:56.788 --> 06:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
the question before the house is the
 
06:18:59.788 --> 06:18:59.798 align:start position:0%
majority committee report of inexpedient
 
06:19:02.230 --> 06:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
to legislate on House Bill
 
06:19:04.548 --> 06:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
121 representative shirtliff was
 
06:19:09.548 --> 06:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:13.070 --> 06:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you m thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:19:14.788 --> 06:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that New
 
06:19:16.628 --> 06:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current tax law permits
 
06:19:19.430 --> 06:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
foreign companies doing business in New
 
06:19:22.030 --> 06:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to evade the business uh
 
06:19:24.628 --> 06:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
profits tax and if I know that this
 
06:19:26.670 --> 06:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
discrimin discri incriminates against
 
06:19:29.150 --> 06:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based businesses putting
 
06:19:31.468 --> 06:19:31.478 align:start position:0%
them at a competitive disadvantage and
 
06:19:33.670 --> 06:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
making them pay more than their fair
 
06:19:36.548 --> 06:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
share and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:19:38.548 --> 06:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
that making foreign companies pay their
 
06:19:41.070 --> 06:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
fair share of business taxes will
 
06:19:43.590 --> 06:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
produce more revenue for our state
 
06:19:46.150 --> 06:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
potentially up to
 
06:19:50.510 --> 06:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
$177 million annually with no impact on
 
06:19:53.190 --> 06:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses or taxpayers
 
06:19:55.628 --> 06:19:55.638 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button thank
 
06:19:57.270 --> 06:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
06:19:59.548 --> 06:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative Janan is
 
06:20:02.468 --> 06:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
06:20:08.990 --> 06:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that no
 
06:20:09.000 --> 06:20:10.030 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that no
other

06:20:10.030 --> 06:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:20:13.190 --> 06:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
state mandates worldwide combined
 
06:20:15.190 --> 06:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
reporting and if I know that the
 
06:20:18.270 --> 06:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
commission that studied this issue voted
 
06:20:21.510 --> 06:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
six to one against recommending
 
06:20:23.590 --> 06:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined
 
06:20:26.270 --> 06:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
reporting and if I further know that the
 
06:20:28.430 --> 06:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
implementation of combined worldwide
 
06:20:30.590 --> 06:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
reporting would be a huge difficulty for
 
06:20:32.548 --> 06:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
businesses and actually make New
 
06:20:34.948 --> 06:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire less competitive thereby
 
06:20:37.270 --> 06:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
potentially lowering business profits
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
because companies would do Less business
 
06:20:42.310 --> 06:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and finally if I know
 
06:20:44.468 --> 06:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
Administration would have a very
 
06:20:50.468 --> 06:20:50.478 align:start position:0%
difficult time ensuring compliance and
 
06:20:53.468 --> 06:20:53.478 align:start position:0%
auditing would I support the itl motion
 
06:20:57.750 --> 06:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:59.190 --> 06:20:59.200 align:start position:0%

expedient to legislate on House Bill 121
 
06:21:05.910 --> 06:21:05.920 align:start position:0%

would I take a bill that's a 16 to zero
 
06:26:51.788 --> 06:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation off consent
 
06:26:54.548 --> 06:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
it's a question worth asking the blurb
 
06:26:56.310 --> 06:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the house Cal is actually longer than
 
06:26:58.270 --> 06:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill the text of the
 
06:27:00.070 --> 06:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill is short so short it's two
 
06:27:02.510 --> 06:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
sentences I'll read it in its entirety
 
06:27:03.948 --> 06:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
so people understand what they're voting
 
06:27:06.830 --> 06:27:06.840 align:start position:0%

reliable presentation of
 
06:27:29.868 --> 06:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
evidence sounds
 
06:27:32.070 --> 06:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable in fact our constitution
 
06:27:33.948 --> 06:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
speaks to this but before I can get to
 
06:27:35.750 --> 06:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
that I want to read two articles out of
 
06:27:38.590 --> 06:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
part first freedom of speech the freedom
 
06:27:40.468 --> 06:27:40.478 align:start position:0%
of deliberation speech and debate in
 
06:27:42.670 --> 06:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
either in either House of the
 
06:27:44.910 --> 06:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislature is so essential to the
 
06:27:46.868 --> 06:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
rights of the people that it cannot be
 
06:27:49.110 --> 06:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
the foundation of any action complaint
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
or prosecution in any Court or Place
 
06:27:54.230 --> 06:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I'll explain why I bring that
 
06:27:55.830 --> 06:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
up in a minute
 
06:27:58.430 --> 06:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
second constitutional principle that is
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
worthwhile rights of the accused part 1
 
06:28:03.510 --> 06:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
Article 15 no subject shall be held to
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
answer for any crime or offense until
 
06:28:08.150 --> 06:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
the same is fully and plainly
 
06:28:09.948 --> 06:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
substantially and formally described to
 
06:28:12.590 --> 06:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
him or be compelled to accuse or furnish
 
06:28:15.190 --> 06:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
evidence against himself every subject
 
06:28:16.750 --> 06:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
shall have the right to produce all
 
06:28:20.750 --> 06:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
proofs not some not most it's all proofs
 
06:28:23.708 --> 06:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
that may be favorable to himself or to
 
06:28:25.628 --> 06:28:25.638 align:start position:0%
meet Witnesses against him face to face
 
06:28:28.030 --> 06:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
and to be fully heard in his defense by
 
06:28:29.708 --> 06:28:29.718 align:start position:0%
himself or his
 
06:28:31.910 --> 06:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
counsel I can go on there's more to that
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:37.150 --> 06:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
article so I'm going to go back in
 
06:28:40.350 --> 06:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
history a little bit as a
 
06:28:42.948 --> 06:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
dad a little over two years
 
06:28:45.190 --> 06:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
ago one of my children was having some
 
06:28:47.868 --> 06:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
medical issues we did appropriate due
 
06:28:50.150 --> 06:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
diligence as parents to treat said
 
06:28:50.160 --> 06:28:52.788 align:start position:0%
diligence as parents to treat said
medical

06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:55.468 --> 06:28:55.478 align:start position:0%
issues we went and saw the emerg went to
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
the emergency room we saw several other
 
06:29:01.230 --> 06:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
doctors I had a nurse who believed we
 
06:29:03.548 --> 06:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
were doing the wrong thing and made a
 
06:29:07.230 --> 06:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:09.590 --> 06:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
DCF I remember that day quite well
 
06:29:11.910 --> 06:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
because I get a phone call from a 20 603
 
06:29:14.590 --> 06:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
271 phone number that I don't
 
06:29:17.590 --> 06:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
know and it's a dcyf employee demanding
 
06:29:19.150 --> 06:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
that my child go immediately to the
 
06:29:21.788 --> 06:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
emergency room now mind you the that
 
06:29:23.350 --> 06:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
same child had been released from the
 
06:29:26.150 --> 06:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
emergency room pirate or 6 days earlier
 
06:29:28.110 --> 06:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
and had been released to go home by the
 
06:29:29.670 --> 06:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
nurse that
 
06:29:34.468 --> 06:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:38.708 --> 06:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
mind I told the dcyf employee because I
 
06:29:40.230 --> 06:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
knew more about the medication than the
 
06:29:44.510 --> 06:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
nurse that I don't think her analysis is
 
06:29:46.990 --> 06:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
correct I'm pretty certain it's
 
06:29:49.468 --> 06:29:49.478 align:start position:0%
faulty her analysis is fundamentally
 
06:29:52.548 --> 06:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
flawed for for numerous medical reasons
 
06:29:54.628 --> 06:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
and I could easily describe those so
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
then no there's no need to go to an
 
06:29:58.190 --> 06:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
emergency room but I will gladly go to a
 
06:30:00.150 --> 06:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
doctor of my choice anywhere in the
 
06:30:01.708 --> 06:30:01.718 align:start position:0%
state if you need me to go get this
 
06:30:03.868 --> 06:30:03.878 align:start position:0%
opinion confirmed no that wasn't good
 
06:30:06.030 --> 06:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
enough we need to see your child in an
 
06:30:08.150 --> 06:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
emergency room right
 
06:30:12.310 --> 06:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
now imminent danger of coma or
 
06:30:15.150 --> 06:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
death say that again imminent danger
 
06:30:17.230 --> 06:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
imminent being the key word of coma or
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
death mind you that child is healthy
 
06:30:22.868 --> 06:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
well and doing well at home right now so
 
06:30:24.590 --> 06:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
imminent danger of coma or death is
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:32.030 --> 06:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
exaggeration this then went into the
 
06:30:35.110 --> 06:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
typical process that parents see if
 
06:30:38.150 --> 06:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're accused of neglect or abuse by a
 
06:30:41.070 --> 06:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
state agency in this case
 
06:30:43.670 --> 06:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
DCF there's a hearing at a court that's
 
06:30:47.070 --> 06:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
a good thing we had one of those about a
 
06:30:47.080 --> 06:30:47.948 align:start position:0%
a good thing we had one of those about a
week

06:30:47.948 --> 06:30:47.958 align:start position:0%
week
 
06:30:51.430 --> 06:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
later between the initial accusation and
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
the court hearing which was on a
 
06:30:56.750 --> 06:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
Thursday my son saw two additional
 
06:31:00.788 --> 06:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
doctors on Friday dcyf spoke with one of
 
06:31:03.788 --> 06:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
those doctors and had a video phone call
 
06:31:05.670 --> 06:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
with my son and my
 
06:31:08.350 --> 06:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
wife and they still continued to push
 
06:31:11.910 --> 06:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
for removal of it of him from the

home a week
 
06:31:17.910 --> 06:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
later imminent danger of coma or
 
06:31:22.030 --> 06:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
death so we get to this first hearing at
 
06:31:26.190 --> 06:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
the court and we agree to a set an order
 
06:31:27.868 --> 06:31:27.878 align:start position:0%
that the judge signs off that was
 
06:31:30.310 --> 06:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
mutually agreed to by all parties I
 
06:31:31.910 --> 06:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
won't read the entire order it was
 
06:31:34.270 --> 06:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
written by
 
06:31:37.468 --> 06:31:37.478 align:start position:0%
hand but I will read two or three key
 
06:31:39.830 --> 06:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
lines the expart order issued in this
 
06:31:43.230 --> 06:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
matter is amended as follows dcyf shall
 
06:31:44.788 --> 06:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
not seek placement outside the home
 
06:31:47.468 --> 06:31:47.478 align:start position:0%
until further court order child shall
 
06:31:48.708 --> 06:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
remain with his
 
06:31:51.070 --> 06:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
parents I'm going to go on the last one
 
06:31:52.708 --> 06:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
is the most important right above the
 
06:31:55.990 --> 06:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
signature of of the judge
 
06:31:57.948 --> 06:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
the scheduling of said hearing meaning
 
06:32:00.070 --> 06:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
the first preliminary evidential
 
06:32:00.080 --> 06:32:01.910 align:start position:0%
the first preliminary evidential
evidentiary

06:32:01.910 --> 06:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
evidentiary
 
06:32:04.110 --> 06:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
hearing shall account for the
 
06:32:06.150 --> 06:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
availability of the father's medical
 
06:32:08.830 --> 06:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
Witnesses all of whom shall be able to
 
06:32:08.840 --> 06:32:10.910 align:start position:0%
Witnesses all of whom shall be able to
testify

06:32:10.910 --> 06:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:32:14.190 --> 06:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
telephonically not most not some all of
 
06:32:16.708 --> 06:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
whom shall be able to testify
 
06:32:19.510 --> 06:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
telephonically December
 
06:32:22.190 --> 06:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
16th Christmas rolls around there's lots
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
going on unfortunately the court C the
 
06:32:25.708 --> 06:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
court and the department can't meet the
 
06:32:27.270 --> 06:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements to have a
 
06:32:28.750 --> 06:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up Hearing in the right amount of
 
06:32:31.548 --> 06:32:31.558 align:start position:0%
time so it's January 21st before we're
 
06:32:33.190 --> 06:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
back in court
 
06:32:35.430 --> 06:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
again one would think I would have time
 
06:32:37.708 --> 06:32:37.718 align:start position:0%
to have at the next
 
06:32:40.388 --> 06:32:40.398 align:start position:0%
hearing the emergency room Doctor Who
 
06:32:43.708 --> 06:32:43.718 align:start position:0%
saw my son the day after the initial
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
accusation to come testify cuz I was
 
06:32:49.150 --> 06:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
just told he would be allowed to testify
 
06:32:51.510 --> 06:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
so I paid an emergency room doctor to
 
06:32:54.230 --> 06:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
sit in the hallway at the conquered City
 
06:32:54.240 --> 06:32:57.150 align:start position:0%
sit in the hallway at the conquered City
Court

06:32:57.150 --> 06:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:57.160 --> 06:33:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
house

06:33:00.230 --> 06:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he didn't get a chance to
 
06:33:05.670 --> 06:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
testify so we get to that 21st order and
 
06:33:07.230 --> 06:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read another court order
 
06:33:08.708 --> 06:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
the following orders and this is coming
 
06:33:10.350 --> 06:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
out of the hearing on the 21st the
 
06:33:12.750 --> 06:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
following orders are entered following
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
this hearing couple different
 
06:33:17.830 --> 06:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
things the case will be scheduled for a
 
06:33:20.110 --> 06:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
three area 3-hour preliminary hearing in
 
06:33:22.110 --> 06:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
which each side will proceed by offers
 
06:33:24.230 --> 06:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
of proof and cross-examination and the
 
06:33:26.350 --> 06:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
pro offered Witnesses each side will
 
06:33:28.110 --> 06:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
have one and a half hours to present
 
06:33:29.990 --> 06:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
their case including
 
06:33:31.670 --> 06:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
cross-examination I would think I would
 
06:33:33.150 --> 06:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
get a chance to bring in my medical
 
06:33:36.510 --> 06:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
Witnesses at that point I have a
 
06:33:38.910 --> 06:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacist I have several medical
 
06:33:40.750 --> 06:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
doctors who were all being paid to be
 
06:33:43.788 --> 06:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
there to present their evidence some of
 
06:33:46.070 --> 06:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
whom have seen my son in person some of
 
06:33:49.190 --> 06:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
whom have not all of whom are experts
 
06:33:51.868 --> 06:33:51.878 align:start position:0%
relative to tox
 
06:33:56.830 --> 06:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
toxicology okay of various Medical
 
06:33:59.948 --> 06:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
Products judge rules in that hearing
 
06:34:03.310 --> 06:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
nope I've made my I've made up my mind
 
06:34:05.350 --> 06:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to let you go ahead and
 
06:34:07.468 --> 06:34:07.478 align:start position:0%
offer your Witnesses I've decided you're
 
06:34:09.548 --> 06:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
already guilty enough that we should
 
06:34:12.590 --> 06:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
proceed to the next hearing which is
 
06:34:14.990 --> 06:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled almost two months later month
 
06:34:16.510 --> 06:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
06:34:20.548 --> 06:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
later my point to all of this is the
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
judges don't even follow their own
 
06:34:25.628 --> 06:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
orders literally same judge same
 
06:34:28.548 --> 06:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
courtroom same Personnel involved on all
 
06:34:31.030 --> 06:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
parties and the judge who issued the
 
06:34:34.350 --> 06:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
order doesn't follow his own
 
06:34:36.788 --> 06:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
orders the system's
 
06:34:39.070 --> 06:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
broken maybe going to children and
 
06:34:41.110 --> 06:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
family law was the wrong place meaning
 
06:34:43.708 --> 06:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
that this is about the judicial process
 
06:34:45.670 --> 06:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
not just the children and family law
 
06:34:48.150 --> 06:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
process there are people in this room
 
06:34:50.310 --> 06:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
who have much greater expertise relative
 
06:34:53.510 --> 06:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the to the courts that might be able
 
06:34:57.190 --> 06:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on what is the right
 
06:34:59.628 --> 06:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
process I think it is worthwhile
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
considering that there are a lot of
 
06:35:04.830 --> 06:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
families who are subject to
 
06:35:07.750 --> 06:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
accusations by the state government who
 
06:35:11.468 --> 06:35:11.478 align:start position:0%
are now respondents who have limited
 
06:35:14.590 --> 06:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
means who are put in in situations where
 
06:35:16.350 --> 06:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
they're not able to
 
06:35:18.990 --> 06:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
respond who should have some reasonable
 
06:35:22.030 --> 06:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
rules to work with so they understand
 
06:35:24.670 --> 06:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
and can expect the department who has
 
06:35:27.948 --> 06:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
effectively unlimited resources to turn
 
06:35:30.350 --> 06:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
in evidence ahead of time so they can
 
06:35:33.110 --> 06:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
respond to it who can turn in Witnesses
 
06:35:36.468 --> 06:35:36.478 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so they can respond to
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
it I agree with the Chairman's report
 
06:35:42.868 --> 06:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
that the the language there needs work I
 
06:35:45.708 --> 06:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
am fully prepared to work on that
 
06:35:47.948 --> 06:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
language I think given where we are
 
06:35:50.230 --> 06:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
right now and our house rules an
 
06:35:53.230 --> 06:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
amendment could not be offered between
 
06:35:56.628 --> 06:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
earlier this week and now I would move
 
06:35:59.110 --> 06:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
to table this so that an amendment can
 
06:36:01.510 --> 06:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
be drafted between various parties so
 
06:36:03.070 --> 06:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
that we can discuss this at our next
 
06:36:05.868 --> 06:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
session Mr Speaker is that motion in
 
06:36:08.510 --> 06:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
order he was recognized to speak it is
 
06:36:10.830 --> 06:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
notate for to make
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
ation you were recognized to speak so
 
06:36:15.670 --> 06:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
making a motion is not appropriate
 
06:36:17.510 --> 06:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
because then you would be speaking twice
 
06:36:19.948 --> 06:36:19.958 align:start position:0%
technically and there are others to
 
06:36:19.958 --> 06:36:23.270 align:start position:0%
technically and there are others to
speak

06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:26.110 --> 06:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
okay for what reason does a member rise
 
06:36:37.230 --> 06:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:53.200 --> 06:37:08.948 align:start position:0%
 
practice

06:37:08.948 --> 06:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:11.590 --> 06:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
rep yes thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
06:37:14.310 --> 06:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
for humoring me on a longer than normal
 
06:37:16.110 --> 06:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
speech I just spoke with the chairman
 
06:37:17.670 --> 06:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
and he would like to share his thoughts
 
06:37:19.788 --> 06:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
on the bill but we will work towards
 
06:37:21.990 --> 06:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
some effort somebody can move make a
 
06:37:25.310 --> 06:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
motion to table this thank you everybody
 
06:37:27.110 --> 06:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson's recognized
 
06:37:30.910 --> 06:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:33.430 --> 06:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker the children
 
06:37:36.070 --> 06:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
and family law committee unanimously
 
06:37:37.948 --> 06:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
voted this bill in expedient to
 
06:37:41.270 --> 06:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
legislate and we did it for two reasons
 
06:37:44.548 --> 06:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
number one sections one and two of the
 
06:37:47.430 --> 06:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
bill contradict each other section one
 
06:37:51.310 --> 06:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
says the family court shall admit any
 
06:37:54.510 --> 06:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
evidence or testimony in any form off by
 
06:37:57.430 --> 06:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
the respondent in a court case section
 
06:37:59.788 --> 06:37:59.798 align:start position:0%
two says that in all proceedings the
 
06:38:01.788 --> 06:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
court shall apply the New Hampshire
 
06:38:05.150 --> 06:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence I've read the book
 
06:38:08.708 --> 06:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
entitled Rules of Evidence it's 280
 
06:38:12.990 --> 06:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
pages long I've read it four times what
 
06:38:15.670 --> 06:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
is stated in this Rules of Evidence book
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
gives the judge considerable latitude
 
06:38:21.388 --> 06:38:21.398 align:start position:0%
and offers suggestions as to when the
 
06:38:23.910 --> 06:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
judge would wisely deny the acceptance
 
06:38:27.350 --> 06:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
of of certain evidence so which is it
 
06:38:29.670 --> 06:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
section one the judge must admit
 
06:38:32.430 --> 06:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
anything or section two the judge
 
06:38:34.628 --> 06:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
following the rules of evidence may
 
06:38:37.830 --> 06:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
decide not to admit something the two
 
06:38:37.840 --> 06:38:38.910 align:start position:0%
decide not to admit something the two
sections

06:38:38.910 --> 06:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
sections
 
06:38:40.948 --> 06:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
contradict the second reason we
 
06:38:44.070 --> 06:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
unanimously voted itl has to do with
 
06:38:46.628 --> 06:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
many of the complaints made to the
 
06:38:48.830 --> 06:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Division
 
06:38:51.830 --> 06:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the Circuit Court this special
 
06:38:54.948 --> 06:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
committee comprises five members from
 
06:38:57.788 --> 06:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
children and family law and five members
 
06:39:00.070 --> 06:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
from the Judiciary
 
06:39:03.548 --> 06:39:03.558 align:start position:0%
Committee in the 14 hours of public
 
06:39:06.110 --> 06:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard many complaints that
 
06:39:08.310 --> 06:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
trials were taking too long and
 
06:39:11.150 --> 06:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
decisions were being pushed too far out
 
06:39:13.510 --> 06:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
because too many pieces of evidence were
 
06:39:17.070 --> 06:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
being admitted if the bill before us is
 
06:39:19.070 --> 06:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
signed into law there's no restriction
 
06:39:21.388 --> 06:39:21.398 align:start position:0%
on what the respondent in a trial may
 
06:39:24.670 --> 06:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
offer how long will the trials go on for
 
06:39:28.628 --> 06:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
now now another piece of evidence that
 
06:39:31.830 --> 06:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
builds the case is different and my
 
06:39:35.788 --> 06:39:35.798 align:start position:0%
friend I think gave some reasons why he
 
06:39:38.190 --> 06:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
could argue what he wanted
 
06:39:43.270 --> 06:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
heard added to the case but if it's not
 
06:39:45.310 --> 06:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
adding to the case the judge should have
 
06:39:47.230 --> 06:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
the right to say no the trial is going
 
06:39:48.388 --> 06:39:48.398 align:start position:0%
on too
 
06:39:51.430 --> 06:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
long additionally many testified before
 
06:39:53.230 --> 06:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
us that the people were offering as
 
06:39:55.468 --> 06:39:55.478 align:start position:0%
evidence statements that had little
 
06:39:58.830 --> 06:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
probative value but were introduced
 
06:40:01.628 --> 06:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
simply to tarnish the character of the
 
06:40:04.468 --> 06:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
other person in other words a statement
 
06:40:07.070 --> 06:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
was offered that added nothing to
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
helping the judge to decide guilt or
 
06:40:12.150 --> 06:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
innocence but the statement was made to
 
06:40:15.388 --> 06:40:15.398 align:start position:0%
drag somebody else through the mud if
 
06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
the respondents profit evidence must be
 
06:40:20.788 --> 06:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
accepted according to part one of this
 
06:40:23.350 --> 06:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
bill we can only imagine the additional
 
06:40:25.270 --> 06:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
amount of mud that will be
 
06:40:29.150 --> 06:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
flinged however I believe there is
 
06:40:32.150 --> 06:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
validity to what lies in the background
 
06:40:35.230 --> 06:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
of this bill that is to say the
 
06:40:37.590 --> 06:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
complaint a judge or two May lean too
 
06:40:39.990 --> 06:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
heavily on one side or the other in
 
06:40:42.190 --> 06:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
admitting or refusing to admit a piece
 
06:40:42.200 --> 06:40:43.310 align:start position:0%
admitting or refusing to admit a piece
of

06:40:43.310 --> 06:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:40:45.468 --> 06:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
evidence that's why the amendment
 
06:40:47.990 --> 06:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
offered to the other Bill about evidence
 
06:40:51.070 --> 06:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
that we voted on by unanimous I think it
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
was Voice vote yesterday said this
 
06:40:57.868 --> 06:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
if a judge denies a piece of evidence
 
06:41:00.350 --> 06:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
over an objection or if the judge
 
06:41:02.750 --> 06:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
refuses a piece of evidence over the
 
06:41:05.150 --> 06:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
objection the judge shall place in the
 
06:41:08.350 --> 06:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
trial record the reason why he or she
 
06:41:11.510 --> 06:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
decided that way I will stipulate that
 
06:41:13.708 --> 06:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
judges have good reasons for what they
 
06:41:16.948 --> 06:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
do and if they do it is not unreasonable
 
06:41:20.548 --> 06:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
to ask them to put it in writing Court
 
06:41:23.350 --> 06:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
administrative supervisors would then
 
06:41:25.708 --> 06:41:25.718 align:start position:0%
review knew what judges wrote in the
 
06:41:28.110 --> 06:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
trial notes especially if complaints are
 
06:41:31.628 --> 06:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
lodged against a certain judge
 
06:41:34.868 --> 06:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
possibly they might conclude a given
 
06:41:38.310 --> 06:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
judge might need some continuing
 
06:41:41.150 --> 06:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
education this I believe speaks to my
 
06:41:44.468 --> 06:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
friend's objections as to how his case
 
06:41:48.910 --> 06:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
was handled so I'd like two things
 
06:41:51.708 --> 06:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
number one I'd like this body to vote
 
06:41:54.990 --> 06:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
itl and number two I will or somebody
 
06:41:57.030 --> 06:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
else can move to table so my friend and
 
06:41:59.788 --> 06:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
I can square a circle here and get
 
06:42:07.270 --> 06:42:07.280 align:start position:0%

thank you everyone make this very very
 
06:49:40.948 --> 06:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
quick so as some of you may know I spent
 
06:49:43.070 --> 06:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
12 and a half years in federal prison
 
06:49:46.310 --> 06:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
for helping an elderly couple resist
 
06:49:48.548 --> 06:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
taxation because it's theft but no it
 
06:49:50.430 --> 06:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
they refused to stand down and it was a
 
06:49:51.948 --> 06:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
10-month standoff so I got caught up in
 
06:49:54.150 --> 06:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
that but the reason up here now is that
 
06:49:56.468 --> 06:49:56.478 align:start position:0%
I'm not alone there are a lot of people
 
06:49:59.628 --> 06:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
in the state who are exf fallons who are
 
06:50:01.510 --> 06:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
not able to get their firearm rights
 
06:50:03.830 --> 06:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
back now you could say well State felons
 
06:50:05.430 --> 06:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
can get their firearms right rights back
 
06:50:07.350 --> 06:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
by appealing to the governor but that's
 
06:50:08.548 --> 06:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
not always possible if you have
 
06:50:10.510 --> 06:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
restitution so for instance a friend of
 
06:50:12.510 --> 06:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
mine she lives in Manchester and she
 
06:50:14.670 --> 06:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
owes over $200,000 and she cannot get
 
06:50:16.910 --> 06:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
her Firearms rights back until she pays
 
06:50:19.910 --> 06:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
the restitution and if we as we've said
 
06:50:22.670 --> 06:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
today we we have equal rights and we
 
06:50:24.270 --> 06:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
respect the rights that God gave us
 
06:50:25.628 --> 06:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
which one of which is to defend our
 
06:50:28.150 --> 06:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
lives our Liberty and property families
 
06:50:31.948 --> 06:50:31.958 align:start position:0%
and property I believe that this is a
 
06:50:34.590 --> 06:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
huge Injustice when this bill would
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
restore firearm rights to nonviolent
 
06:50:40.270 --> 06:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
felons I understand there's people out
 
06:50:42.548 --> 06:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
there that should not own guns and some
 
06:50:43.990 --> 06:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
of those people are in government but
 
06:50:47.270 --> 06:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
the point being is that we need to
 
06:50:50.990 --> 06:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
delineate who is truly a danger and I do
 
06:50:52.388 --> 06:50:52.398 align:start position:0%
don't feel that I'm a danger I think the
 
06:50:53.788 --> 06:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
people that sit next me don't feel that
 
06:50:58.388 --> 06:50:58.398 align:start position:0%
way maybe so I put this bill forward and
 
06:51:00.110 --> 06:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
as an example to some let's say on the
 
06:51:02.388 --> 06:51:02.398 align:start position:0%
other side let's think about the January
 
06:51:04.948 --> 06:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
6 guys now personally I think that was a
 
06:51:07.310 --> 06:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
complete entament scheme but when they
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
get home now they will never be able to
 
06:51:10.350 --> 06:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
get their firearms race back they're
 
06:51:13.070 --> 06:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
Federal felons and I can guarantee you
 
06:51:15.788 --> 06:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
yeah but the house will be in order no
 
06:51:17.150 --> 06:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's a fair point I get how you
 
06:51:18.430 --> 06:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
feel that they're the enemies of the
 
06:51:20.230 --> 06:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
system but let's think about black lives
 
06:51:23.830 --> 06:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
matter do black lives really matter
 
06:51:25.468 --> 06:51:25.478 align:start position:0%
if we're keeping them from ever owning
 
06:51:28.070 --> 06:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
guns again you know what I mean we got
 
06:51:29.708 --> 06:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
to kind of be on an equal par here we
 
06:51:30.910 --> 06:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
got to kind of figure out what's
 
06:51:30.920 --> 06:51:34.868 align:start position:0%
got to kind of figure out what's
important

06:51:34.868 --> 06:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:37.270 --> 06:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
so and let me uh let me just run through
 
06:51:39.430 --> 06:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
briefly real quickly just a couple
 
06:51:41.510 --> 06:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
nonviolent Federal felonies that might
 
06:51:45.190 --> 06:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
surprise you so let's say fraud that
 
06:51:46.590 --> 06:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
person who commits fraud 20 years ago
 
06:51:47.788 --> 06:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
should never be able to defend himself
 
06:51:50.868 --> 06:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
or his family filing a false lean
 
06:51:52.868 --> 06:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
against a judge or a federal official
 
06:51:55.350 --> 06:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know like selling weed or
 
06:51:58.590 --> 06:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
drugs and then we have perjury I think
 
06:51:59.750 --> 06:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
most of the people in Congress have
 
06:52:01.868 --> 06:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
committed perjury multip but anyway so
 
06:52:03.510 --> 06:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
these people will never be able to get
 
06:52:05.750 --> 06:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
their firearms right back and I think
 
06:52:08.270 --> 06:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's hypocritical and dangerous we're
 
06:52:12.150 --> 06:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
creating a two-tiered two-tiered society
 
06:52:14.430 --> 06:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
with second class citizens and if you
 
06:52:16.310 --> 06:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
think that somebody that you push off
 
06:52:17.788 --> 06:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
into the corners is all of going to
 
06:52:19.310 --> 06:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
sudden you know going to bow down to and
 
06:52:20.830 --> 06:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
and want to be part of the society
 
06:52:21.990 --> 06:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're not that's what we have in
 
06:52:23.310 --> 06:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
conqueror right now all Le homeless
 
06:52:24.788 --> 06:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
people run around they've created an
 
06:52:27.190 --> 06:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
alternate society so I believe we need
 
06:52:28.510 --> 06:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
to bring people back and I think
 
06:52:30.910 --> 06:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
forgiveness is key for the January 6
 
06:52:33.230 --> 06:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
people or for the the black lives matter
 
06:52:35.150 --> 06:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
riers I think we got to kind of say okay
 
06:52:37.150 --> 06:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
you know what we made some mistakes and
 
06:52:38.590 --> 06:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
historically that's already happened so
 
06:52:41.270 --> 06:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
we had Shay's Rebellion after after the
 
06:52:42.910 --> 06:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
revolution some Farmers out in
 
06:52:44.230 --> 06:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts decided they didn't feel
 
06:52:47.150 --> 06:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
like paying back some suspect taxes so
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
they started a rebellion and afterwards
 
06:52:51.270 --> 06:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
John Hancock the first governor of
 
06:52:53.388 --> 06:52:53.398 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts he pardoned them all and
 
06:52:55.270 --> 06:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
they were going to break into a federal
 
06:52:58.150 --> 06:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
Armory and get some guns it wasn't some
 
06:52:59.868 --> 06:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
kind of you know waving flags kind of
 
06:53:01.590 --> 06:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
thing but forgiveness is really how
 
06:53:02.830 --> 06:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to get back this whole
 
06:53:03.990 --> 06:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
Bridging the Divide is not going to
 
06:53:05.230 --> 06:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
happen by yelling at somebody and hoping
 
06:53:07.910 --> 06:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to acques so that's why I
 
06:53:09.190 --> 06:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
brought the bill forward and I'm just
 
06:53:10.548 --> 06:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
doing this to get a roll call to figure
 
06:53:12.190 --> 06:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
out if people really do believe in gun
 
06:53:14.990 --> 06:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
rights and human rights so
 
06:53:17.990 --> 06:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
thanks I call for a roll call go through
 
06:53:18.000 --> 06:53:18.788 align:start position:0%
thanks I call for a roll call go through
thank

06:53:18.788 --> 06:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:53:21.910 --> 06:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
you represent St representative Stones
 
06:53:23.190 --> 06:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak speak for the
 
06:53:23.200 --> 06:53:26.190 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak speak for the
committee

06:53:26.190 --> 06:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:29.230 --> 06:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I'm going to
 
06:53:30.948 --> 06:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
make this very short concise into the
 
06:53:34.430 --> 06:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
point our committee heard a lot of
 
06:53:36.510 --> 06:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
testimony in regards to this issue both
 
06:53:37.628 --> 06:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
at subcommittee level and regular
 
06:53:39.510 --> 06:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee level it needs to be brought
 
06:53:42.430 --> 06:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
up that currently under RSA 6515 is an
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
analment process that we have had
 
06:53:46.468 --> 06:53:46.478 align:start position:0%
codified in our rsas for some time that
 
06:53:48.548 --> 06:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
provide Provisions for felons to get
 
06:53:51.070 --> 06:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
their firearms rights back if we have
 
06:53:53.230 --> 06:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
due process to take someone's right away
 
06:53:54.708 --> 06:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
we should have due process to return
 
06:53:56.110 --> 06:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
them that gives the judge the
 
06:53:58.070 --> 06:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the record look
 
06:54:00.388 --> 06:54:00.398 align:start position:0%
at the individual notice all the parties
 
06:54:02.270 --> 06:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
involved and then make an educated
 
06:54:04.948 --> 06:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
decision at his level or her level to
 
06:54:07.590 --> 06:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
reinstate Firearms rights is a byproduct
 
06:54:09.468 --> 06:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
of the analment and that also applies to
 
06:54:10.788 --> 06:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors that's how you get your
 
06:54:13.670 --> 06:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
rights back to possess Firearms uh one
 
06:54:16.510 --> 06:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
of the bigger issues that we have is you
 
06:54:20.548 --> 06:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
cannot have a state law that oversees
 
06:54:24.230 --> 06:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
federal law we we have federal laws and
 
06:54:26.230 --> 06:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
convictions we do not have the authority
 
06:54:28.190 --> 06:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
to anal those at the state level the
 
06:54:30.388 --> 06:54:30.398 align:start position:0%
federal system has no analment mechanism
 
06:54:31.708 --> 06:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
that includes the military code of
 
06:54:34.070 --> 06:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
justice as well they have no mechanism
 
06:54:36.830 --> 06:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
for analment we have jurisdiction over
 
06:54:39.548 --> 06:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
state level offenses and that's probably
 
06:54:41.190 --> 06:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
where it should be unfortunately the
 
06:54:44.388 --> 06:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
feds have never decided to have analment
 
06:54:46.270 --> 06:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
and with that being said I would urge
 
06:54:49.190 --> 06:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
you to really think about having a due
 
06:54:51.110 --> 06:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
process mechanism to reinstate
 
06:54:52.910 --> 06:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
individuals rights to buiness best
 
06:54:56.070 --> 06:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
Firearms it's much cleaner it keeps
 
06:54:58.868 --> 06:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
everybody on the same page you just
 
06:55:01.230 --> 06:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
can't I just can't fathom having oh it's
 
06:55:03.110 --> 06:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
7 years in 1 minute now I can have a
 
06:55:04.990 --> 06:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
firearm without going before Justice to
 
06:55:06.868 --> 06:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
have my rights reinstated and to have
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
that taking out of the ncks screen which
 
06:55:11.590 --> 06:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
everybody utilizes in addition there is
 
06:55:14.270 --> 06:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
no State licensed firearm dealer it's
 
06:55:16.910 --> 06:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
Federal a federal firearms dealer would
 
06:55:19.990 --> 06:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
still be prohibited from doing business
 
06:55:22.190 --> 06:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
with any convicted felon who's seeking
 
06:55:24.590 --> 06:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
to purchase purchas a firearm unless
 
06:55:28.670 --> 06:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
their state charges are annulled thank
 
06:55:31.190 --> 06:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
you representative gerhart's requested a
 
06:55:32.990 --> 06:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
roll call and it is sufficiently
 
06:55:35.030 --> 06:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
seconded this will be a roll call vote
 
06:55:51.510 --> 06:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:51.520 --> 06:56:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
seats

06:56:14.990 --> 06:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:21.468 --> 06:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:21.478 --> 06:56:23.868 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:56:23.868 --> 06:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:56:25.510 --> 06:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
question before the house is a majority
 
06:56:27.430 --> 06:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexpedient to
 
06:56:30.270 --> 06:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 144 and this is
 
06:56:32.468 --> 06:56:32.478 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote representative Gerhard
 
06:56:37.030 --> 06:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:39.468 --> 06:56:39.478 align:start position:0%
inquiry if I knew that article 7 of the
 
06:56:41.830 --> 06:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
state constitution is State sovereignty
 
06:56:44.070 --> 06:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
and if I knew that private firearm sales

07:03:51.510 --> 07:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker so I'm um rising in supported
 
07:03:53.708 --> 07:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
the TL motion and hence an opposition to
 
07:03:57.750 --> 07:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
the bill um the prime sponsor correctly
 
07:04:00.310 --> 07:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
stated that we we'd be making special
 
07:04:02.270 --> 07:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
guns as a stamped in New Hampshire on
 
07:04:03.830 --> 07:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
them um
 
07:04:06.510 --> 07:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
and and the idea is I think the idea is
 
07:04:08.270 --> 07:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
somehow that magically exempts them from
 
07:04:10.830 --> 07:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations um that which I
 
07:04:13.150 --> 07:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
think is uh incorrect so that's why I
 
07:04:15.548 --> 07:04:15.558 align:start position:0%
support the uh committee report of
 
07:04:18.510 --> 07:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
itl um this this bill is actually a
 
07:04:20.750 --> 07:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
repeat of one that came up uh like 16
 
07:04:22.750 --> 07:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
years ago sponsored by by uh a lot of
 
07:04:24.590 --> 07:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
you may remember Dan itsa he was a prime
 
07:04:25.708 --> 07:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor and he had lots of very
 
07:04:27.270 --> 07:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
interesting ideas ideas are always
 
07:04:28.750 --> 07:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
interesting but some of them were bad
 
07:04:31.310 --> 07:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
but anyway um first and foremost this
 
07:04:33.190 --> 07:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill is unnecessary there's no shortage
 
07:04:35.350 --> 07:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
of guns in New Hampshire in
 
07:04:39.708 --> 07:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
2022 uh almost 133,000 guns were sold um
 
07:04:40.948 --> 07:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
so that's a lot of guns so there's
 
07:04:42.750 --> 07:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of guns on the market and I'm not
 
07:04:46.948 --> 07:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
really sure like uh how what how that
 
07:04:48.190 --> 07:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
would be good for our state's gun
 
07:04:50.430 --> 07:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers including six hour which
 
07:04:52.510 --> 07:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh is located the next town over for me
 
07:04:54.230 --> 07:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
I live in Durham it's their Us
 
07:04:56.990 --> 07:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
headquarters are in um are in
 
07:05:00.110 --> 07:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
Newington um the New Hampshire gun
 
07:05:01.510 --> 07:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
Market is a tiny fraction of the
 
07:05:04.310 --> 07:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
nationwide market that's 17.4 million
 
07:05:06.708 --> 07:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
people and a high percentage of those
 
07:05:09.150 --> 07:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
17.4 million guns were sold to law
 
07:05:10.708 --> 07:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies the military and
 
07:05:13.868 --> 07:05:13.878 align:start position:0%
other professional users who probably
 
07:05:16.310 --> 07:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
would have little or no enthusiasm for
 
07:05:17.910 --> 07:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh being able to use unregistered and
 
07:05:21.350 --> 07:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
unregulated weapons so they actually um
 
07:05:24.150 --> 07:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
and 6 hour I know relies primarily on
 
07:05:25.990 --> 07:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
sales to that to the law enforcement the
 
07:05:28.788 --> 07:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
military Market um and even ones to just
 
07:05:31.990 --> 07:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
regular people but I might call amateur
 
07:05:34.190 --> 07:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
gun users a lot of the sales pitches
 
07:05:35.990 --> 07:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you can use the same cool guns that
 
07:05:39.628 --> 07:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
the military or the police use um now
 
07:05:41.670 --> 07:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
just picking on Sig um just because I
 
07:05:43.230 --> 07:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
visited their Factory and I'm familiar
 
07:05:44.948 --> 07:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
with them um they would have to set up a
 
07:05:46.628 --> 07:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
SE separate production line just for
 
07:05:49.510 --> 07:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
these special New Hampshire only guns
 
07:05:51.030 --> 07:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
that would be very expensive and I think
 
07:05:53.548 --> 07:05:53.558 align:start position:0%
it would um damage Sig existing
 
07:05:55.110 --> 07:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
relationships with law enforcement and
 
07:05:57.468 --> 07:05:57.478 align:start position:0%
Military markets I'm not sure like if
 
07:05:58.990 --> 07:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
any of the major manufacturer sayate
 
07:06:00.190 --> 07:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
would even be interested in
 
07:06:02.670 --> 07:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
participating in this um it's also
 
07:06:04.708 --> 07:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
unenforceable there's a very vague
 
07:06:06.830 --> 07:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
definition of what constitutes a
 
07:06:08.788 --> 07:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
component they can using these guns and
 
07:06:11.310 --> 07:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism really for
 
07:06:13.948 --> 07:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
verifying that all those components are
 
07:06:15.708 --> 07:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
in fact sourced from inside the state of
 
07:06:17.468 --> 07:06:17.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there's also no
 
07:06:20.430 --> 07:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
penalties for exporting these guns and
 
07:06:22.110 --> 07:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
you just know people would carry those
 
07:06:24.230 --> 07:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
guns across our state line it's it's
 
07:06:27.070 --> 07:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
inevitable guns are very easily portable
 
07:06:29.110 --> 07:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
commodity there's a worldwide market for
 
07:06:31.948 --> 07:06:31.958 align:start position:0%
them you know it's uh these things are
 
07:06:34.270 --> 07:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
going to go out of state and I I guess
 
07:06:35.708 --> 07:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
we don't have much jurisdiction over
 
07:06:37.548 --> 07:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
what people in other states do with
 
07:06:40.788 --> 07:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
these special guns stamped uh made in
 
07:06:43.230 --> 07:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but uh I mean we could
 
07:06:44.670 --> 07:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
probably at least put something in there
 
07:06:46.708 --> 07:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
to forbid people from trying to export
 
07:06:50.110 --> 07:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
them so that means uh we have no jurors
 
07:06:51.548 --> 07:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
and um there's also other jur
 
07:06:53.788 --> 07:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issues um first of all we
 
07:06:55.030 --> 07:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
simply don't have the power to
 
07:06:57.070 --> 07:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
unilaterally exclude any weapon from
 
07:06:59.628 --> 07:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation not no matter what
 
07:07:01.910 --> 07:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
magic phrase We stamp on the barrel and
 
07:07:04.628 --> 07:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
also this bill's Provisions for uh
 
07:07:07.350 --> 07:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting the member will
 
07:07:10.868 --> 07:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
suspend it is way way too loud in here
 
07:07:12.590 --> 07:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
the member has a right to be heard if
 
07:07:14.788 --> 07:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
you have to have a conversation take it
 
07:07:17.150 --> 07:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
out into the YY room remember may
 
07:07:20.230 --> 07:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
continue okay the well I'm almost at the
 
07:07:22.190 --> 07:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
end actually the other Juris problem is
 
07:07:24.590 --> 07:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to prosecute um law
 
07:07:27.030 --> 07:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement other officials or even uh
 
07:07:29.510 --> 07:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
government contractors who try to
 
07:07:32.830 --> 07:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
enforce Federal Regulations um on these
 
07:07:34.310 --> 07:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
guns and I'm sure the federal government
 
07:07:37.628 --> 07:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
would uh believe that these guns are um
 
07:07:39.230 --> 07:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
can be treated the same way as any other
 
07:07:41.070 --> 07:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
guns that are manufactured in any other
 
07:07:45.788 --> 07:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
state um and Al and finally and um so
 
07:07:49.150 --> 07:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
that's a also finally a lot of probably
 
07:07:50.670 --> 07:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of the gun users would
 
07:07:51.868 --> 07:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
actually like they would like they
 
07:07:53.230 --> 07:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
prefer to have a gun they can take out
 
07:07:55.110 --> 07:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
of state without breaking the law they
 
07:07:57.868 --> 07:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
and certainly know the the prime market
 
07:08:00.070 --> 07:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
for our weapons manufacturers is uh you
 
07:08:02.510 --> 07:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
know law enforcement the military they
 
07:08:04.548 --> 07:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
they they like having a certain amount
 
07:08:05.910 --> 07:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
of regulation in the market they might
 
07:08:07.548 --> 07:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
want less than they have but um you know
 
07:08:09.510 --> 07:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
they don't object to being regulated uh
 
07:08:12.628 --> 07:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
so so um as I said this is an
 
07:08:12.638 --> 07:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
so so um as I said this is an
interesting

07:08:13.670 --> 07:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
07:08:16.230 --> 07:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
idea if I ever WP iy those of us who
 
07:08:17.548 --> 07:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
knew him there's a few room he always
 
07:08:19.468 --> 07:08:19.478 align:start position:0%
had interesting ideas but most some of
 
07:08:22.350 --> 07:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
them were good some of them were bad
 
07:08:24.190 --> 07:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
this idea was bad a dozen years ago it's
 
07:08:27.270 --> 07:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
still a bad idea so I would uh I would
 
07:08:30.190 --> 07:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
urge you to do it the vamous majority of
 
07:08:33.190 --> 07:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
the policy committee did earlier this or
 
07:08:35.948 --> 07:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
last year late last year which is to uh
 
07:08:39.310 --> 07:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on the itl and uh then we can
 
07:08:40.948 --> 07:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
wait another dozen years to entertain
 
07:08:43.030 --> 07:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves with this bill again uh later
 
07:08:45.548 --> 07:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
so thank you very
 
07:08:50.310 --> 07:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:50.320 --> 07:08:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
Gart

07:08:55.750 --> 07:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:58.070 --> 07:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay less than one minute so guns can
 
07:08:59.628 --> 07:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
already be made with 3D printers the
 
07:09:01.150 --> 07:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
idea of trying to keep guns from going
 
07:09:02.430 --> 07:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
across the state border with new laws
 
07:09:03.388 --> 07:09:03.398 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything people can
 
07:09:04.868 --> 07:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
print them anywhere in the back of a car
 
07:09:07.990 --> 07:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
so that's pointless the the bigger issue
 
07:09:11.628 --> 07:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
is having federal agents run around the
 
07:09:13.788 --> 07:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
state looking for some supposed gun
 
07:09:15.788 --> 07:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
violations that we don't need to have
 
07:09:17.548 --> 07:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
happening we have our own police we have
 
07:09:19.310 --> 07:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
our own laws and if we need new laws we
 
07:09:20.788 --> 07:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
can create them here we don't need to be
 
07:09:22.468 --> 07:09:22.478 align:start position:0%
going to D and having a whole bunch of
 
07:09:25.110 --> 07:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
mess happening in between here and there
 
07:09:28.830 --> 07:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
so that's a point and thank
 
07:09:31.948 --> 07:09:31.958 align:start position:0%

turot speak against the motion thank you
 
07:16:18.670 --> 07:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I'm going to rise in
 
07:16:22.190 --> 07:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
opposition to the motion to recommit as
 
07:16:24.468 --> 07:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
you will notice in the calendar the bill
 
07:16:26.270 --> 07:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
came out of committee with an
 
07:16:30.788 --> 07:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
181 uh recommendation of ought to pass
 
07:16:33.788 --> 07:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
now in 2015 there was a study committee
 
07:16:36.070 --> 07:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh done and what came out of that
 
07:16:38.590 --> 07:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
committee was a recommendation that the
 
07:16:40.708 --> 07:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities be given more
 
07:16:43.030 --> 07:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
discretionary authority over the use of
 
07:16:45.750 --> 07:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
flaggers police details whether you used
 
07:16:48.830 --> 07:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
them or not and who would
 
07:16:51.910 --> 07:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh who would actually uh have that
 
07:16:54.388 --> 07:16:54.398 align:start position:0%
authority to do it within roads and
 
07:16:56.788 --> 07:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
their jurisdiction and that's important
 
07:16:59.388 --> 07:16:59.398 align:start position:0%
here it's within their Juris di this is
 
07:17:00.670 --> 07:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
not state
 
07:17:03.750 --> 07:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
roads uh during the public hearing and
 
07:17:06.190 --> 07:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
the executive session and in written
 
07:17:09.110 --> 07:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard from municipalities
 
07:17:11.230 --> 07:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
and there was a Divergence of thought
 
07:17:14.990 --> 07:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
some thought uh what they had been doing
 
07:17:17.910 --> 07:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
for years and years
 
07:17:20.990 --> 07:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
um we didn't need a bill others said we
 
07:17:23.070 --> 07:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
need the bill because we don't think we
 
07:17:27.190 --> 07:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
can do it so what this became was a an
 
07:17:31.388 --> 07:17:31.398 align:start position:0%
amended bill that basically clarifies
 
07:17:34.948 --> 07:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
and codifies in the rsas in in many
 
07:17:37.190 --> 07:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
cases what has been going on for decades
 
07:17:39.350 --> 07:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk a little bit more about
 
07:17:40.548 --> 07:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
that in a
 
07:17:44.548 --> 07:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
minute so after we passed in committee
 
07:17:47.430 --> 07:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
and it was published we got
 
07:17:52.070 --> 07:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
some emails and calls from less than a
 
07:17:55.468 --> 07:17:55.478 align:start position:0%
handful of individuals uh former and a
 
07:17:57.590 --> 07:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
07:18:00.670 --> 07:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
current police Chiefs in uh a couple
 
07:18:01.948 --> 07:18:01.958 align:start position:0%
couple of the
 
07:18:05.230 --> 07:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
towns now I'll talk about exactly what
 
07:18:07.590 --> 07:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
what their issues
 
07:18:07.600 --> 07:18:10.468 align:start position:0%
what their issues
were

07:18:10.468 --> 07:18:10.478 align:start position:0%
were
 
07:18:13.350 --> 07:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
but all of them showed a lack of
 
07:18:15.788 --> 07:18:15.798 align:start position:0%
understanding for exactly what the bill
 
07:18:17.548 --> 07:18:17.558 align:start position:0%
and the amendment was
 
07:18:19.830 --> 07:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
doing there were a couple of them that I
 
07:18:22.628 --> 07:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
what I would call strawman
 
07:18:26.110 --> 07:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
arguments so what I did is I
 
07:18:29.270 --> 07:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
called my town manager or My Town
 
07:18:31.310 --> 07:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
Administrator and I
 
07:18:34.990 --> 07:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
said I assume the way this has worked in
 
07:18:35.000 --> 07:18:36.590 align:start position:0%
said I assume the way this has worked in
in

07:18:36.590 --> 07:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:18:40.190 --> 07:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
barington is that the selectman hires a
 
07:18:40.200 --> 07:18:41.110 align:start position:0%
barington is that the selectman hires a
Town

07:18:41.110 --> 07:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
Town
 
07:18:43.310 --> 07:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
Administrator the selectman are the
 
07:18:46.388 --> 07:18:46.398 align:start position:0%
municipal uh legislative
 
07:18:48.628 --> 07:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
body the chief is
 
07:18:51.070 --> 07:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
appointed and the town ad
 
07:18:53.910 --> 07:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
administrator is the one who oversees
 
07:18:53.920 --> 07:18:54.750 align:start position:0%
administrator is the one who oversees
the

07:18:54.750 --> 07:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:18:57.150 --> 07:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
executive decisions for the
 
07:19:00.788 --> 07:19:00.798 align:start position:0%
town I said tell me the chain of command
 
07:19:03.948 --> 07:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
in barington how do who
 
07:19:07.708 --> 07:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
decides who's if a a detail is going to
 
07:19:09.788 --> 07:19:09.798 align:start position:0%
be even used if it's going to be a
 
07:19:12.350 --> 07:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
police detail is it going to be flaggers
 
07:19:15.150 --> 07:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
or or none at all and he said I'll get
 
07:19:16.990 --> 07:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
back to you I'm not sure and when he got
 
07:19:19.830 --> 07:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
back his response was the police chief
 
07:19:22.388 --> 07:19:22.398 align:start position:0%
and I both see this legislation as
 
07:19:25.590 --> 07:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
enabling in barington the police chief
 
07:19:28.430 --> 07:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
decides and that is how it has B been
 
07:19:31.070 --> 07:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
done for as long as we
 
07:19:35.388 --> 07:19:35.398 align:start position:0%
know again this language
 
07:19:39.190 --> 07:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
codifies that uh which has been going on
 
07:19:41.948 --> 07:19:41.958 align:start position:0%
in you know many municipalities forever
 
07:19:41.958 --> 07:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
in you know many municipalities forever
and

07:19:44.310 --> 07:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:46.910 --> 07:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
ever so now what I want to do is talk
 
07:19:48.430 --> 07:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
about a couple of
 
07:19:53.468 --> 07:19:53.478 align:start position:0%
the emails or comments that I've
 
07:19:56.150 --> 07:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
received the first one from a police
 
07:19:59.868 --> 07:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
chief in a mediumsized city
 
07:20:02.750 --> 07:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
said many of the construction Crews
 
07:20:05.548 --> 07:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
actually want police officers and this
 
07:20:08.270 --> 07:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
may eliminate that option that is not
 
07:20:10.830 --> 07:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
the case the police chief makes the
 
07:20:13.708 --> 07:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision if the police chief
 
07:20:15.670 --> 07:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
hears from the construction Crews that
 
07:20:18.430 --> 07:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
they want a detail whether that's police
 
07:20:22.110 --> 07:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
detail or a a flagging detail or no
 
07:20:25.430 --> 07:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
detail the police chief still has that
 
07:20:27.910 --> 07:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
Authority I heard it from another uh
 
07:20:31.270 --> 07:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
another one uh another medium-sized City
 
07:20:33.430 --> 07:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
this limits the use of qualified or
 
07:20:35.510 --> 07:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
trained police on the streets performing
 
07:20:38.350 --> 07:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
the traffic deal uh details and removes
 
07:20:41.708 --> 07:20:41.718 align:start position:0%
the chief's ability to determine if an
 
07:20:44.948 --> 07:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
officer is appropriate again just gone
 
07:20:46.270 --> 07:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
over that that's
 
07:20:49.230 --> 07:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill
 
07:20:49.240 --> 07:20:51.670 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill
codifies

07:20:51.670 --> 07:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
codifies
 
07:20:54.150 --> 07:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
then I got one from a a rather lengthy
 
07:20:55.468 --> 07:20:55.478 align:start position:0%
one from a
 
07:21:04.270 --> 07:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:07.590 --> 07:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
chief he tended he
 
07:21:10.110 --> 07:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
his issue was in the case of an
 
07:21:12.190 --> 07:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
emergency for fire trucks or ambulance
 
07:21:13.468 --> 07:21:13.478 align:start position:0%
or cruises we need to know that
 
07:21:15.430 --> 07:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
emergency Personnel would be able to get
 
07:21:18.030 --> 07:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
through that's a straw Maring argument
 
07:21:21.430 --> 07:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
any other town if you have a traffic
 
07:21:21.440 --> 07:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
any other town if you have a traffic
accident

07:21:23.270 --> 07:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
accident
 
07:21:26.230 --> 07:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
or you needed somebody on site pretty
 
07:21:30.350 --> 07:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
soon it's the individuals on the traffic
 
07:21:32.948 --> 07:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
detail are not going to be on duty
 
07:21:35.030 --> 07:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
police officers so you're going to go to
 
07:21:37.910 --> 07:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
your on duty police officers and
 
07:21:39.030 --> 07:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're going to respond
 
07:21:41.030 --> 07:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
within a couple minutes to take care of
 
07:21:44.230 --> 07:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:46.670 --> 07:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
about and then the last one I received
 
07:21:50.990 --> 07:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
was this language OB obvious OB Ates
 
07:21:53.510 --> 07:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
more than it clarifies who makes the
 
07:21:55.750 --> 07:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
determination that the use of an officer
 
07:21:57.868 --> 07:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
is needed to protect the public it
 
07:21:59.990 --> 07:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
refers to the municipality is that
 
07:22:03.548 --> 07:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
selectman City Council road agent dep
 
07:22:05.350 --> 07:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Public's Work Director or
 
07:22:07.430 --> 07:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
police chief again we've just gone
 
07:22:10.110 --> 07:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
through that and ultimately it is the
 
07:22:14.868 --> 07:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:14.878 --> 07:22:16.788 align:start position:0%
 
determination

07:22:16.788 --> 07:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
determination
 
07:22:19.430 --> 07:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
now the issue that I think some people
 
07:22:21.510 --> 07:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
have or one of the issues some people
 
07:22:21.520 --> 07:22:22.670 align:start position:0%
have or one of the issues some people
have

07:22:22.670 --> 07:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:22:25.948 --> 07:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
is what happens if the police chief is
 
07:22:28.910 --> 07:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
going too far using too many details or
 
07:22:30.468 --> 07:22:30.478 align:start position:0%
on the flip side of that not using
 
07:22:30.478 --> 07:22:31.590 align:start position:0%
on the flip side of that not using
enough

07:22:31.590 --> 07:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
enough
 
07:22:35.110 --> 07:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
details that becomes the
 
07:22:37.430 --> 07:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the Town
 
07:22:39.230 --> 07:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
Administrator he's the one that's going
 
07:22:41.310 --> 07:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
to make that determination and if he
 
07:22:43.670 --> 07:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
fails in his job that's going to be up
 
07:22:48.510 --> 07:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:51.190 --> 07:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
municipality so again what this bill
 
07:22:54.468 --> 07:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
does is it simply codifies and puts into
 
07:22:54.478 --> 07:22:56.308 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
07:24:45.030 --> 07:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill was retained in our committee
 
07:24:47.270 --> 07:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
because it was complex and needed
 
07:24:50.350 --> 07:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
further study and if I know that even at
 
07:24:53.190 --> 07:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
this late date and very late hour we
 
07:24:56.110 --> 07:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
feel it still needs more work because of
 
07:24:58.110 --> 07:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
new information that's come to light
 
07:25:01.270 --> 07:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
some of which was recited by the chair
 
07:25:04.270 --> 07:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
of our committee just now and if I know
 
07:25:06.750 --> 07:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
that the prudent thing to do when new
 
07:25:08.628 --> 07:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
information comes to light is to take
 
07:25:11.430 --> 07:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
time to consider that information when I
 
07:25:14.548 --> 07:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
now press the green button and send HB
 
07:25:17.110 --> 07:25:17.120 align:start position:0%

bipartisan recommendation of 18 to1
 
07:25:34.708 --> 07:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended and if I know
 
07:25:37.070 --> 07:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
that these last minute uh protests
 
07:25:39.350 --> 07:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
against this bill are either a result of
 
07:25:42.230 --> 07:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
strawman arguments or just incorrect
 
07:25:44.708 --> 07:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
